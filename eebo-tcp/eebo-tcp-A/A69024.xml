            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Deare Mother, although I accord with all that my Sisters have here said, yet seeing it pleaseth you to impose this taske upon me, I shall give you a <hi>faithfull</hi> and <hi>just</hi> account, what I further conceive to be not altogether unworthy our serious consideration, about the <hi>dedicating</hi> and <hi>presenting</hi> the <hi>Reply</hi> to the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5075:4"/>First, we all know what reward others have had for the like <hi>service,</hi> and that of fresh <hi>memory</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a Minister, appealing from the Prelates, to the King for a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>equall hearing</hi> of his Cause, which was about the discharge of his Ministry in Preaching: was delivered over to the Censure of a Court, wherein his maine Adversary sate a Judge, and the Censure was accordingly so <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,</hi> as no <hi>age</hi> can <hi>parallell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, Secondly, the same Adversary that was the Prime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigator to <hi>inflict</hi> the said Censure, continues still in the same <hi>power</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> in Court, so as if my Sister <hi>Charity</hi> her selfe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Humility,</hi> should present the <hi>Reply,</hi> I know not what <hi>security</hi> she can have from the like Censure of being both Schismaticall and Seditious, because she thus <hi>appeares</hi> against a most notorious Adversary of <hi>CHRIST</hi> and his Word, but such, whose <hi>power</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> in Court, can so farre prevaile to the <hi>abusing</hi> of the <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>unsuspicious nature</hi> of Princes, as to make them <hi>beleeve</hi> that they cannot possibly be <hi>misled</hi> by such a Leader, although the Prelate himselfe confesse, that <hi>Worth once misled, proves of all other the greatest Misleader</hi>; and the <hi>Replyer</hi> hath <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected</hi> and <hi>proved</hi> him the most notorious <hi>blind</hi> Leader, that ever sate in <hi>Canterbury</hi> Chaire.</p>
               <p>And, Thirdly, who sees not the maine <hi>worke,</hi> that so many <hi>arrowes</hi> of <hi>persecution</hi> against <hi>Gods</hi> Ministers and <hi>people,</hi> and so the Gospell it selfe (as appeares too palpably by the Prelates usuall practises) doe ayme at? As, namely, the <hi>rooting out</hi> of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the <hi>erecting</hi> of all Popish Superstition and Idolatry, and so the bringing in of Atheisme and Infidelity, with Antichristian Tyranny, and all to <hi>reduce England</hi> to a Reconciliation with <hi>Rome,</hi> as also the <hi>Relation</hi> it selfe doth unblushingly discover. And the Merchants doe tell us from <hi>abroad,</hi> how the Priests and Fryers can tell them (upon occasion of the <hi>Scots</hi> first standing out) that this course was by the Prelaticall Faction reaching as farre as <hi>Rome,</hi> resolved on before yesterday.</p>
               <p>And, Fourthly, when we looke upon the hideous <hi>outrages</hi> of the Prelates, against which no <hi>complaint</hi> can take <hi>place,</hi> nor find better successe, then as when a <hi>man</hi> casts <hi>stones upward,</hi> which fall down againe upon his own <hi>head</hi>: doth it not argue the Estate of things to be <hi>desperate,</hi> and at the <hi>height,</hi> when such men as the Prelates are mounted on a <hi>throne of iniquity, framing mischiefe as by a Law?</hi> But yet,</p>
               <p>Lastly, (notwithstanding all this) when I consider, how <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully God</hi> hath heard the <hi>earnest prayers</hi> of his <hi>people,</hi> in moving
<pb facs="tcp:5075:5"/>
the Kings <hi>heart</hi> to such an <hi>accord</hi> with <hi>Scotland,</hi> as of late (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though those <hi>bitter</hi> Roots, which GOD never <hi>planted,</hi> and which <hi>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>son</hi> the very <hi>ground</hi> they goe on (the Prelates I meane, so fast are they <hi>rooted</hi> in the <hi>earth</hi>) are left still unplucked up) and that <hi>the Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the Rivers of waters,</hi> and that if he were once rightly possessed of the State of things, wherein he hath been by the Prelates extreamly abused, and his State exposed to the wrath of <hi>heaven,</hi> we should be in good hope of Reformation: so as what <hi>lawfull</hi> meanes may be most likely and probable to conduce hereunto, is worth the putting in <hi>practise,</hi> though full of <hi>hazzard;</hi> saving that the same GOD, who <hi>mightily</hi> and <hi>mercifully</hi> moved the Kings <hi>heart</hi> so farre to yeeld to his Scottish Subjects, as to enjoy in a good measure (the Prelates onley excepted) their <hi>liberty</hi> of Conscience: can also perswade him to doe as much, and <hi>more,</hi> for his Subjects, <hi>Christs people,</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> And therefore my <hi>conclusion</hi> is: I am so farre from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to <hi>humane discretion,</hi> or <hi>carnall reason,</hi> in this point, that I could be content to <hi>accompany</hi> my Sisters, <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> in presenting the <hi>Reply,</hi> resolving with <hi>Hester, And if I perish, I perish.</hi> And this is all I have to say for the <hi>present.</hi>

               <p>Deare Mother, <hi>I</hi> would willingly accompany my other Sisters to the Court in <hi>presenting</hi> the <hi>Reply</hi> to the King, but that there, I am <hi>better known then trusted.</hi> So as I could never yet have any good successe there.

                  <hi>O Lord God Almighty, Who shall not feare thee, thou King of Saints? Great and marvelous are thy works; just and true are thy wayes. Thou art the great King over all the Earth, the righteous Iudge of all the world, the GOD that hearest Prayer, and helpest thy People, when they cry unto thee, and judgest their cause when thou seest their strength is gone. But how long, LORD, Holy and True! when wilt thou arise, and have mercy upon</hi> Sion? <hi>Is not now the time, the set time come ? Is it not now a day of rebuke and blasphemy ? Are not the children brought to the birth, and there is none, to deliver ? How long shall thy people cry, and thou answerest not ? How long shall the enemy roare, and thou regardest not ? How long shall he blaspheme thy Name ? For ever ? Why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy bosome ? Art not thou our King of old, working Salvation in the midst of the Earth ? Didst not thou divide the Sea for thy People to passe through ? And art not thou the same GOD of</hi> Israel <hi>still ? Or is thine arme shortened, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not save ? And dost thou not remember this, how the enemy hath reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, O LORD, and blasphemed thy Name ? And wilt thou deliver the soule of thy Turtle Dove unto the Beast ? Wilt thou forget the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of thy poore for ever ? Remember thy Covenant O Lord, for we are thy People, and thou art our GOD. Other Lords besides thee have
<pb facs="tcp:5075:6"/>
had dominion over us: but by thee onely will we make mention of thy Name. And yet dost thou not see, the darke places of the Earth full of the habitations of Cruelty ? O let not the oppressed returne ashamed. The poore and needy cry unto thee, they trust in thee, they waight for thee, that they may praise thy Name. Arise therfore, O GOD, plead thine own Cause, remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not the voyce of thine enemies; the tumult of those that rise up against thee, increaseth continually.</hi> And now behold here <hi>spread</hi> before <hi>thee,</hi> a Book of <hi>Reproaches</hi> and <hi>Blaspemies</hi> against thy Majesty, and against thy Sonne <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and against thy Holy Spirit, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy Holy Word, and against thy Holy Ministers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy Holy People, and against thy Holy and Pure Worship, yea, and against the Kings Sacred Majesty, whom thou hast set over thy People to governe them according to Truth and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, under whose <hi>Patronage</hi> and Authority, notwithstanding, the <hi>Relator</hi> is bold to shrowd this his Book with all the <hi>Blasphemies</hi> and Falsities therein contained; So as hereby, not onely the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpation of all true Faith and Religion in the Land is <hi>threatned,</hi> but consequently the <hi>utter ruine</hi> and <hi>extermination</hi> of the Nation it selfe hastened, already <hi>fitted</hi> as dry <hi>fewell</hi> for thy <hi>wrath,</hi> by this Incendiary. For behold <hi>Lord</hi> what <hi>havock</hi> is made in the Land?

What <hi>usurped</hi> Tyrannicall Domination over thy Ministers and People ? What <hi>imposition</hi> of the intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>yoake</hi> of Ceremonies upon their <hi>necks,</hi> bringing them againe under Antichristian <hi>bondage,</hi> whom <hi>Christ</hi> by the <hi>shedding</hi> of his <hi>precious blood</hi> hath made <hi>free ?</hi> And what <hi>urging</hi> and <hi>pressing</hi> with <hi>furious rage</hi> reaching up to <hi>heaven,</hi> the <hi>observation</hi> of all <hi>humane</hi> Ordinances, while, yea and whereby thy <hi>divine</hi> Ordinances are cast <hi>out ? And what wilt thou now doe to thy great Name ?</hi> Thou hast of late by <hi>terrible signes</hi> from <hi>heaven,</hi> as it were by sound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, <hi>summoned</hi> the whole Land, threatning to destroy it. Surely the <hi>provocations</hi> are <hi>great,</hi> were not thy Patience <hi>greater.</hi> But thou expectest Repentance, with Reformation of all these <hi>abominations.</hi> But <hi>little appearance</hi> as yet, and as <hi>little hope,</hi> while such Books as this, are Patronized and Authorized. What then <hi>Lord ?</hi> Wilt thou therfore proceed to judge the whole Land for these things ? Surely <hi>the whole Land is defiled,</hi> and so the cause were <hi>just.</hi> But yet
<pb facs="tcp:5075:7"/>
remember <hi>Lord,</hi> that thou hast a <hi>remnant</hi> yet left therein, that have not <hi>bowed the knee to Baal.</hi> And consider withall, that they are a Faction principally of some few persons, as the Prelates, that have caused such <hi>confusions</hi> in the Land. <hi>And wilt thou destroy the righteous with the wicked farre be that from thee.

But you might have added, <hi>on Earth.</hi> On Earth, no doubt, the <hi>greatest Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage</hi> you can have, is the <hi>Kings</hi> But haply you neither <hi>thought,</hi> nor <hi>hoped</hi> of any <hi>higher Patron</hi> of this <hi>Tract,</hi> then on Earth.

need some <hi>humane Patronage,</hi> and that <hi>as Great, as may be had</hi>; and all little enough, you will find in the end. But I hope, when once your <hi>Tract</hi> shalbe well <hi>troden</hi> out and <hi>beaten,</hi> that you will find but few that will <hi>travell</hi> your way, or <hi>follow</hi> such a <hi>Leader,</hi> and much lesse hazzard their own both <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>safety,</hi> by Patronizing such a <hi>perillous Tract,</hi> as this will appeare to be. And though you should find some to protect you from the Courts of <hi>Civill Iustice,</hi> yet never from <hi>Christs</hi> dreadfull Throne, where you shall certainly be judged, <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>L. p. 2. <hi>He that seeks it</hi> (Court Truth) <hi>with a Roman Bias, or any other, then for it selfe, will run counter, when he comes neere it, and not find it, though he come within the Kenning of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. Sir you say true. And for proofe hereof, it will appeare, and that too palpably, that this <hi>Roman Bias</hi> hath too much wheeled you about from the <hi>Truth,</hi> which you pretend to <hi>seek,</hi> but neither <hi>come neere it,</hi> nor <hi>within the Kenning of it.</hi> Or if <hi>within Kenning,</hi> so as you have been at any time by its cleare light convinced of it, the greater is your <hi>sin,</hi> and the more des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate your case, not to <hi>confesse</hi> it, but how much more to fight against it? And think not my L. that your plausible naming of <hi>Truth</hi> here, will so blind mens eyes, as to beleeve all is <hi>truth,</hi> that you have written in your Book. If you seek <hi>Truth,</hi> 'tis but as those <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>But before I passe further, I may not balke the close of your <hi>words,</hi> complaining, You are under the <hi>Prophets affliction:</hi> Psal. 50.19, 20. And what is that? <hi>Between the mouth that speaks wickednesse, and the tongue that sets forth Deceit.</hi> And whose <hi>affliction</hi> was this? The Prophets you say. What <hi>Davids?</hi> Yes. How prove you that out of that Psalme? 'Tis true, <hi>David</hi> had many <hi>afflictions</hi> in this kind; which hee in other Psalmes much complaines of: but he speakes not a word of his owne proper <hi>afflictions</hi> in this kind in that Psalme, which you quote. Therefore to passe by both your <hi>forced</hi> expression of the <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>false</hi> application of the <hi>sense:</hi> Let us take the Prophets own <hi>word: But unto the wicked, GOD saith what hast thou to doe to declare my Statutes, or that thou shouldest take my Covenant in thy mouth? Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee? When thou sawest a thiefe, thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentedst with him, and hast been partaker with Adulterers. Thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest thy mouth to evill, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

Now consider this, ye that forget GOD, least I teare you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi> Thus farre GOD speaketh in that Psalme. In all which you see plainly, that the <hi>Prophet</hi> complains not of his owne <hi>suffering</hi> such things of wicked <hi>tongues.</hi> It is GOD that speaks here to wicked <hi>men.</hi> And if you had well and wisely looked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here GOD speakes to the <hi>wicked,</hi> and sets him forth by sundry <hi>markes</hi> and <hi>properties</hi>: as First, his notorious and audacious, shamelesse <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> in pretending to be for GOD, and for his true Religion: For he taketh upon him to <hi>declare Gods Statutes, and takes his Covenant in his mouth,</hi> but for all this, he <hi>hateth instruction, and casteth Gods

But of late dayes, since you came to sit in that Chaire, one undertook to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Originall anew, and intire, as it was at first set forth by the Author, without altering any thing, as the <hi>Translator</hi> professed in his Epistle <hi>Dedicatory</hi> to Mris <hi>Anne Roper,</hi> a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Recusant. This <hi>Translation</hi> being brought to your Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lein to <hi>license,</hi> it past for currant, as containing nothing in it against Faith and Manners, and so was <hi>licensed</hi> without the least correction of the grossest things in it.

So Printed it was. And coming abroad, some began to find fault with it; and the stinke of the Booke more and more increasing with stirring, it came at length to be smelled by your Lordship. Hereupon what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious examination you used about it, I know not: but there being some Jealousie, that some one of those THREE fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned troublesome <hi>bitter men</hi> (whose Cause was then shortly to be heard) might haply among other things (might they have been permitted to speake freely (cast that Booke in your Lordships dish: the next newes we heard of it, was, that a Proclamation is published for the burning of the Book in Smith-field, wherein also all the blame was layd upon the poore Printer, for which he must to prison, and you and your Chaplein were acquitted and cleared, as no way faulty.

            <p>P. How? What doe I heare? GOD forbid? What, neither <hi>perswade,</hi> nor <hi>practise Persecution, no not in the least?</hi> And must GOD be named in it too? What meaneth then (as <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.14.</note> SAMUEL said to SAUL) the <hi>bleeting of the Sheepe, and the bellowing of the Cattell in mine eares?</hi> Or you mistook the word, when instead of GOD <hi>forbid,</hi> you should have said, <hi>GOD forgive me both for perswading Persecution, and for practising it, and that in as high a measure as possibly I could,</hi> the times considered.

               <hi>But I was received to mercy, for I did it ignorantly through unbelife.</hi> But can you say so? Or rather doe you not sin against the light of <hi>Gods</hi> Word, against the light of your Conscience, against the light of naturall Reason, and the Law of Humanity, and against <hi>Gods</hi> Law, and against Mans Law, and (I had almost said) against the Holy Ghost it selfe? Unlesse you be one of those, that for blindnesse <hi>stumble at noon day.</hi> How many godly and able Ministers of <hi>Christ,</hi> together with their Wives and Children, are cast out, and undone by you, and all for not daring to obey you in those things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of necessity they must have dishonour'd GOD? Or for omitting one of your Ceremonies, perhaps but once, or twice, and the like? Yet this with you is no <hi>persecution,</hi> no not in any kind. What is it then? Onely a punishing of the Puritans, that so they may be rooted out. This you blushed not to say openly in Starre-chamber, when you with your Brethren were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for casting out above a hundred Ministers in <hi>Norfolk, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, Essex, Kent, Surrey,</hi> and where not? But you neither <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> nor <hi>perswaded</hi> to it. Why did you not <hi>disswade?</hi> Why did you not <hi>enterpose</hi>? Why did you not relieve them, when upon Petition to the King, they were referred to you? No such thing. They are a sort of Puritans: they must be rooted out, This is enough to wash your hands of <hi>persecution</hi>: as <hi>Pilate</hi> did of his condemning of <hi>Christ:</hi> for they are Puritans. So the Popish Prelates in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, in <hi>burning</hi> the Martyrs, were no <hi>persecuters</hi>; for those Martyrs were Hereticks. Nor will the High Priests and Pharisees prove <hi>persecuters,</hi> and <hi>murtherers</hi> in Crucifying of <hi>Christ,</hi> for they could say, He was a <hi>seducer</hi> and <hi>deceiver.</hi> And so in summe, There wilbe found no such thing in <hi>rerum naturâ,</hi> not in the whole world, as <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution</hi> is. Now what <hi>patience</hi> can refrain it self at these things? O notorious, impious, shamelesse, gracelesse Hypocrisie.

               <hi>For no man takes this honour upon him, but he that is called of GOD, as was Aaron.</hi> But your <hi>Priesthood</hi> hath no <hi>calling</hi> from GOD.

For first a <hi>Christian King,</hi> or Magistrate Supream is (as we touched before) both within, and of the Hive: but the <hi>Priest</hi> you speake of, is quite without the Hive, and none of the Hive, no Priest of <hi>Christs</hi> true Church, but an intruder, <hi>Droane, Waspe,</hi> or <hi>Hornet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, good Christian Princes, executing their office aright, are <note n="§" place="margin">

And have you never read nor heard, that if one that is <hi>chaste,</hi> come among the <hi>Bees,</hi> not offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring violence unto them, they will never offer to <hi>sting</hi> him: but if an <hi>adulterous person</hi> come amongst them, they will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly smell him out, and be all about his eares? And be sure, <hi>Christs Bees</hi> cannot brooke such <hi>Priests,</hi> as smell of the whore of <hi>Babels</hi> Smocke, and commit <hi>spirituall whoredome</hi> with her, or have any hankering affection after her. And therefore mervaile not, if (as you say) when it comes to the <hi>Priest, the Bees come about like Waspes, or Hornets, all sting, and no honey for your Priest there.</hi> And you seem to speak it feelingly. Surely if you deale roughly with the <hi>Bees,</hi> and begin to lay about you, they wil be about your Eares. Therefore be not curst unto them, least you make them as angry as a <hi>Bee.</hi> Thus by your <hi>patience</hi> I have truely and genuinely applyed your Similitude.

            <p>Lastly, before I leave your Comparison of the <hi>Bee-hive,</hi> I cannot but note two pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ces of Scripture, which you make (as you use to doe, when you apply any Scripture, which is not a Shooe will fit your foot) very bold with. For the first: you say, <hi>The Kings case (as King</hi> Davids) <hi>is to be stung with the Bees.</hi> For this you quote in the Margent, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.12. And you apply it to the King, saying, <hi>God grant it be never yours.</hi> Why, was <hi>David stung</hi> by the <hi>true Church and Children of GOD,</hi> which you compare to a Hive of <hi>Bees?</hi> You are much mistaken. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> there speakes not onely in his owne Person, but as a Type, ingenerall of <hi>Gods Church,</hi> and in particular of <hi>Christ.</hi> First, as in his owne Person: who were those <hi>Bees</hi> that <hi>stung</hi> him, or buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed about his eares? Were they any of <hi>Gods Children?</hi> Was it not especially <hi>Saul,</hi> who continually <hi>persecuted</hi> him, and sought his <hi>life,</hi> to have <hi>stung</hi> him to <hi>death?</hi> Wherein was he not rather

the <hi>Master-Wasp,</hi> or the <hi>Master-Hornet,</hi> that with his <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.</note> Swarms of <hi>Wasps and Hornets,</hi> armed <hi>troopes</hi> pursued after <hi>Davids life,</hi> and sometime inclosed him like a Swarme of <hi>Bees</hi>? And for this very Cause, did not <hi>David</hi> complaine to the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Sauls</hi> cruelty, setting forth his wickednesse under the name <note n="‡" place="margin">

               <hi>Saul sent, and they watcht the house to kill him, coming about him like Bees: David</hi> thereupon flyes to GOD in <hi>prayer,</hi> to deliver him <hi>from the workers of iniquity, and to save him from bloody men.</hi>

               <hi>shalt laugh at them, thou shalt have all the Heathen in derision.</hi> Now by Heathen here is plainly meant, <hi>Saul</hi> and his <hi>wicked Servants</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> and that for their <hi>heathenish cruelty,</hi> seeking to murther <hi>innocent David.</hi> With such <hi>Bees</hi> therefore was he compassed about. That's for his Person. Secondly, <hi>David</hi> in that Psalme, 118. represents the <hi>Church of God,</hi> that <hi>Bee hive</hi> you Spake of, whose <hi>Bees</hi> are often <hi>smoaked</hi> out of their <hi>Hive,</hi> or <hi>smothered</hi> in the <hi>Hive,</hi> and their <hi>honey</hi> devoured by the wild Boares of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, the Common <hi>Bee-hunters,</hi> a right Embleme of the cruell <hi>persecuters</hi> of <hi>Gods Children</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> who are here in the world, <hi>as Sheep in the midst of Wolves.</hi> One fresh bleeding-new example I could give you of one Member of this Church, one <hi>Bee</hi> of this <hi>Hive,</hi> whom you sent your Officers with Swords and Weapons beseting his <hi>house</hi> to take him, as you did, and though not to <hi>kill</hi> him presently, yet with <hi>intent,</hi> that in case He did <hi>live,</hi> His <hi>life</hi> should be <hi>worse</hi> then any <hi>death.</hi> So as, hath not such a one reason to hold himselfe one of that Church, which <hi>David</hi> in his <note n="†" place="margin">

               <hi>Psalmes,</hi> prefigured, as touching the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted estate therof in this world? But enough of this Instance before. Thirdly, in that Psalme, and that passage by you quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and so foulely misapplyed, <hi>David</hi> speakes Typically and Prophetically of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that principally. They came about him like <hi>Bees.</hi> Who? The <hi>High Priests,</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi> who also hooked in the <hi>secular power, Caesar,</hi> and the <hi>Priest</hi>; these came Swarming about <hi>Christ,</hi> like <hi>Bees</hi>; which they did, first in the <hi>Garden,</hi> where they <hi>apprehended him</hi>; then in the <hi>High Priests hall,</hi> where they <hi>accused him</hi>; then in the Praetorium, before <hi>Pilate,</hi> where they <hi>condemned him;</hi> as before <hi>Herod,</hi> where they <hi>mocked him:</hi> and last of all, they <hi>Stung him to the heart</hi> with a <hi>Roman Speare,</hi> his <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> fast nayled to the <hi>Crosse.</hi> Thus the <hi>Great Master Bee</hi> of the <hi>Hive</hi> was <hi>stung</hi> to <hi>death</hi> by the

Hierarchies instigation. And thus indeed, GOD grant it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be our Kings case, as it was <hi>Christs.</hi> Thus I hope you see by this time, what a <hi>Divine</hi> you are in your application of Scripture. If you heare but the buzzing of a <hi>Bee,</hi> presently that's the <hi>Bee</hi> that <hi>stings</hi> you. Whereas in truth, you and all such as you, who are <hi>persecuters</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and murtherers of him in his Saints, and Servants, are those <hi>Bees</hi> that <hi>David,</hi> and in him <hi>Christ</hi> complaines of, <hi>They came about me like Bees.</hi> But take with you what followes: <hi>They</hi> (these <hi>Bees) are quenched as the fire of thornes: For in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.</hi>

But beleeve it, their <hi>Prayers</hi> like winged <hi>darts,</hi> or <hi>arrowes,</hi> fly <hi>swiftly,</hi> and pierce <hi>deep,</hi> and will deadly <hi>wound</hi> where they <hi>light,</hi> though as yet ye be not sensible of it. But all this while I heare not a word of the <hi>Hornets</hi>-Selfe-<hi>stinging.</hi> Why doe ye not yet cry out of the deadly <hi>sting</hi> of your own Conscience, For all the <hi>innocent blood</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> Servants, which you have shed, and for all the <hi>havock</hi> you have made in his <hi>Hive?</hi> Nay rather, your <hi>heart</hi> is so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>sinne,</hi> and blinded with <hi>Romish zeale,</hi> that instead of <hi>remorse,</hi> you look for a <hi>reward.</hi> And a <hi>reward</hi> you shall have of him, whose <hi>words</hi> you feare not to <hi>cite,</hi> who Saith, <hi>Behold I come quickly, and my Reward is with me, to give to every man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as his works shalbe.</hi> But you tell us immediately before this, that you are <hi>stung</hi> of the <hi>Bees, many times for no offence, nay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:5075:49"/>
for Service done them, would they see it.</hi> Many times for no <hi>offence.</hi> Therfore it seems sometimes it is for <hi>offence</hi> done them by you. But can you name any one <hi>time,</hi> when they <hi>sting</hi> you without being extreamely provoked by your <hi>offence</hi> given them? Shew it if you can.

Your <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing</hi> and <hi>burthening</hi> their Consciences with more and more Romish <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies?</hi> Your fetching them up to your <hi>High-Commission,</hi> and there undoing of them, <hi>clipping their wings,</hi> that they can now no more doe their <hi>office,</hi> and bring any more <hi>honey</hi> to the <hi>Hive;</hi> and so muzling their <hi>mouthes,</hi> that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, dare not, so much as <hi>humme?</hi> What other <hi>Service</hi> can they <hi>see</hi> you doe them?

            <p>For a Conclusion of this your <hi>similitude</hi> of the <hi>Bee-hive:</hi> the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> upon <hi>earth</hi> you <hi>compare</hi> to a <hi>Hive</hi> of <hi>Bees.</hi> And <hi>when the Priest putteth his hand to the Hive, he shalbe sure to be Stung, and there is no Honey for him.</hi> This Priest is the Prelate, an Hierarchicall man. And as I noted before, the <hi>true</hi> Bees of <hi>Christ,</hi> his <hi>true</hi> Church, cannot brook such Priests, such Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchicall men, to meddle with them. <hi>Ergo</hi> hence I conclude, that the Hierarchy, consisting of Priests, and such like men, as Prelates, or an Hierarchicall Church, is no <hi>true</hi> Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> is not this Hive of Bees, to which you compare the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> upon <hi>earth.</hi> How so? For your Prelaticall Church is such a Hive of Bees, as the Priest may put his hand to the Hive without any <hi>feare</hi> or danger of <hi>stinging,</hi> at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. For in that Hive all the Bees are so <hi>conformable</hi> to the Priest their Master-Bee, as they yeeld all subjection to his <hi>dictates,</hi> neither doe they, or dare they, at any <hi>time</hi> offer to <hi>sting</hi> him. But if this Priest offer to meddle with <hi>Christs</hi> Bee-hive, and to impose his Cannon Law, and Ceremonies upon <hi>Christs</hi> Bees, to inforce them to <hi>conformity</hi> to his Rules, the Bees doe no more acknowledge such a Priest, or Prelate for a Master,

            <p>L. p. 15. <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>is in a hard Condition. She professes the Ancient Catholick Faith, and yet the Romanist con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes her of Novelty in her Doctrine. She practises Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it hath been in all Ages, and places, where the Church of Christ hath taken any rooting, both in, and ever since the Apostles times, and yet the Seperatist condemnes her for Antichristianisme in her Discipline.</hi>

            <p>P. It matters not so much, <hi>who</hi> they be, that thus <hi>condemn your Church of England,</hi> as how true it is, whereof you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.

                  <hi>Profession of Faith no Sound and Sufficient proofe of a true beleever.</hi>

And is not the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Catholick Faith,</hi> that, <hi>which Christ and his Apostles taught,</hi> and have left recorded in the Scriptures? Dare you deny this? Now in what <hi>particular</hi> the <hi>Romanist</hi> condemnes you <hi>for Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Doctrine,</hi> I know not. Surely not in those, wherein them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are equally <hi>condemned,</hi> I will instance in two <hi>Doctrines,</hi> wherein both you and they are Apostatized and departed from the <hi>Ancient Catholick Faith in your Novelty of Doctrine.</hi> The first is your <hi>Forbidding of Marriage,</hi> wherein thus farre you goe with the <hi>Romanist,</hi> in forbidding Marriage to all <hi>sorts</hi> of persons for certain <hi>times</hi> in the <hi>yeare,</hi> in all, amounting to upon 20. weeks, wanting not halfe a quarter of halfe of the <hi>yeare.</hi> The Second is, <hi>Forbidding Certain Meates,</hi> on <hi>certaine dayes,</hi> and <hi>weeks,</hi> in the <hi>yeare.</hi> And your Zeale in the <hi>observation</hi> hereof showeth plainly, that you make it a <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> as the <hi>Romanist</hi> doth, and not a meere civill thing, as the <hi>Statute</hi> makes it. Now let us see what the Adostle saith of both these: for he couples them together: <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Now the Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the Faith, giving heed to seducing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Doctrines of Devils, speaking lyes in hypocrisie, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to abstain from Meats, which GOD hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them, which beleeve and know the Truth.

every Creature of GOD is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving. For it is sanctified by the Word of GOD, and Prayer.

Where we may observe these <hi>particulars.</hi> First, That these two <hi>Doctrines, Forbidding of Marriage and certaine Meates,</hi> are, <hi>Doctrines of Devils:</hi> Secondly they proceed from <hi>lying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>: Thirdly they are <hi>lyes spoken in hypocrisie</hi>; as if some times were more <hi>holy</hi> then <hi>Marriage</hi> it selfe, <note n="*" place="margin">

Fifthly, That the holding of these <hi>Doctrines</hi> is a <hi>departing</hi> from the <hi>faith: Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, These <hi>Doctrines,</hi> are the <hi>markes</hi> and <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>last times, perillous times, times</hi> of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and <hi>Antichristian Apostacie</hi>; and therfore they are <hi>Doctrines of Novelty.</hi> Seaventhly, For the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>confirmation</hi> of all this, <hi>The Spirit speaketh it expresly,</hi> So as it admits of no <hi>doubting,</hi> or <hi>gainsaying.</hi> Eightly, and lastly, That it is the <hi>duty</hi> of every good Minister of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> nourished up in the words of <hi>faith</hi> and good Doctrine, to put the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren in <hi>remembrance</hi> of these things. So as it were to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> had some good Ministers of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that durst and would cry out against these <hi>Doctrines of Divels,</hi> practised by the Prelates and their Disciples, and learned from <hi>Antichrist</hi> himselfe, and upheld by his Canon Law against the expresse <hi>word of God.</hi> Thus then doth not the Church of <hi>England</hi> justly lie under the <hi>Apostles sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for Novelty in Doctrine,</hi> yea holding <hi>Doctrines of Devils,</hi> and that by the expresse testimony (not of Romanists,) but of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> that cannot lye?

            </p>
            <p>We come now to your <hi>discipline,</hi> wherein the <hi>Separatist</hi> (you say) <hi>condemnes her</hi> (the present Church of <hi>England</hi>) of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianisme.</hi> A sore Charge, and sufficient, if true, to <hi>sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> from you.

And an example hereof <hi>St. Iohn</hi> notes

in his third Epistle, of <hi>Diotrephes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.</note> who was ambitious of Prelacie, hee loved to have, <hi>The Preeminence,</hi> the <hi>Bishops Chaire,</hi> hee prateth against <hi>Iohn,</hi> hee <hi>receives not the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren,</hi> and <hi>forbids them that would,</hi> and <hi>and throwes them out of the Church by Excommunication,</hi> just as you and the Pope doe. This ambition and erection of Prelacie or Hierarchy, was that <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> which Satan began to brood and hatch even in the Apostles dayes, and wherein we have <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes,</hi> quickly grown up as the first Cocke of the Game, of speciall and particular note, and name, that durst affront even the Apostle himselfe. And this <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ever since, though at first, and in the first Ages it grew up but slowly, by reason of a <hi>tò katekon,</hi> à Remora, or maine <hi>impediment,</hi> the Roman Empire, whose Imperiall Seat being once removed from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Constantinople</hi> by <hi>Constantine,</hi> who consopited, appeased, and put an end to those tenne Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, which had been a great hinderance to Antichrists growth: then began this <hi>Mistery</hi> to perke up, and the Bishop of <hi>Rome Silvester</hi> the first could be content to weare a Crown, put upon his head by <hi>Constantine,</hi> which upon <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight his head, was multiplyed to a <hi>triple Crown,</hi> one for <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> another for <hi>earth,</hi> and third for <hi>purgatory</hi>; and thus by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees successively it grew up to that height, which we see it now arrived at, even its <hi>Akmè,</hi> or full Stature, beyond which it cannot goe, though it would: So as its main <hi>care, strength,</hi>

For who is a lyer, but he that denyeth Iesus to be the Christ? He is Antichrist,</hi> Saith the Apostle <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, neither were it any great difficulty to prove, that you Prelates, (and that according to your owne Doctrine in many places of your Book) <hi>do deny Iesus to be the Christ</hi>; to wit, <hi>the onely Prophet of his Church.</hi> For you allow no <hi>beliefe,</hi> that the Scripture is the <hi>voyce</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Prophet,</hi> except the <hi>voyce</hi> and Tradition of the present Church doe first usher it in. And this Church must alwayes be meant of a <hi>Prelaticall</hi> Church. <hi>No question of that.</hi> And for <hi>Exposition and Sense of Scripture,</hi> you deny that the <hi>Scripture it selfe,</hi> and <hi>of it selfe,</hi> hath sufficient <hi>light,</hi> (as at after we shall see at large) and therefore you referre us either to the <hi>Exposition of the Primitive Church, or the Decisions of Generall Councels,</hi> for the right Sense of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> Thus you doe <hi>akuro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sa,</hi> (as <hi>Christ</hi> saith) or make voyd and <hi>of no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> the <hi>voyce of Christ,</hi> by your <hi>Tradition.</hi> Nay you Say also, <hi>That if a Generall Councel should Conclude and Decree an Errour, yet all men ought to yeeld obedience</hi> (at least externall) <hi>thereunto, till another Generall Councel, equall to that, shall reverse and correct it.</hi> And (by the way) what if it shall make it <hi>worse,</hi> or adde more Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to it? But thus doe you not <hi>deny Christ</hi> to be the onely Prophet of his Church (of whom <hi>God</hi> Saith, <hi>Heare Him, Him onely, His Word onely, His Voyce onely</hi>) when you do not take <hi>his Word to be light enough,</hi> and to be <hi>sufficient to interpret it selfe,</hi> but that you must have recourse to Generall Councels, consisting of Prelates; as your Oracles, to decide all <hi>doubts and controversies
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:5075:55"/>
of Faith</hi>? Doe you not thus attribute a greater light to men, then to the <hi>voyce</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi> GOD Saith of <hi>Christ,</hi> that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22.</note> 
               <hi>Heare him in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you:</hi> but you say, <hi>In all doubts and controversies of faith, heare what a Generall Councel Saith, yea though it determine Errours, yet all men are bound to yeeld obedience thereunto.</hi> Thus the expresse <hi>voyce</hi> and cleare <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Christ that Prophet,</hi> must depend upon Men, and those an <hi>Assembly of Prelates or Priests,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> never ordained in his Church; and not men, upon It. And so in this respect also, <hi>denying Christ</hi> to be the <hi>onely All sufficient</hi> Prophet to instruct and establish his Church in all Truth, while you deny his <hi>word</hi> to be <hi>Autópistos,</hi> and <hi>Autàrkes,</hi> of selfe-Credit, <hi>of it selfe</hi> to be <hi>beleeved,</hi> and <hi>selfe-sufficient</hi> to shew and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it selfe: you prove your selfe an <hi>Antichrist:</hi> For <hi>who is a lyer, but he that denyeth that Iesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist.</hi> Your <hi>Grace</hi> therefore is an <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I come to the third Instance, to which (I confesse) I thought to have confined my selfe, and not to have touched the other two in this place, though they be no lesse proper, then this: which is, <hi>That you Prelates, both by Profession and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, as you are Prelates, doe deny Iesus to be the Christ, in that you deny him to be the onely Lord, and King of his Church.</hi> For what is for <hi>Christ</hi> to be the <hi>King</hi> of, and over, and in his Church, but (as to exercise his <hi>Almighty power,</hi> and <hi>Fatherly care,</hi> and <hi>Spouse-like love,</hi> in <hi>protecting</hi> and <hi>preserving</hi> his Church, from all <hi>evills,</hi> in <hi>comforting</hi> her in the midst of <hi>afflictions,</hi> in <hi>supplying</hi> her with all necessary Graces and Blessings, and in <hi>vindicating</hi> the <hi>cause</hi> of his People against all their Persecuters and Oppressors: So also) in bearing a Speciall <hi>Kingly Rule</hi> in and over their <hi>Soules and Consciences,</hi> in all things concerning <hi>Faith,</hi> in the <hi>Worship and Service of God.</hi> So as the <hi>people</hi> of <hi>God</hi> doe, and ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Christ</hi> herein their onely <hi>King,</hi> and not to suffer their <hi>consciences</hi> to be captivated, and insnared by any <hi>ordinance</hi> of Man, whatsoever in point of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>ceremonies</hi> in <hi>Gods service,</hi> injoyning a necessary <hi>conformity</hi> thereunto. 'Tis <hi>Christs</hi> Prerogative alone in this <hi>case,</hi> to sit as King in the <hi>throne</hi> which he hath set up for himselfe in every mans <hi>conscience.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> hath <hi>redeemed</hi> us from all <hi>bondage</hi> and <hi>subjection</hi> to <hi>humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises</hi> in Spirituall things: as the Apostle saith, <note n="‡" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23.</note>

               <hi>Christ</hi> under their <hi>feet,</hi> and make this his <hi>purchase</hi> voyd, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves in his <hi>throne,</hi> by sitting <hi>in</hi> and <hi>over</hi> mens <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi> making Laws, and imposing Rites (as absolute Kings over the Church) binding the Conscience to a necessary <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> to them in the <hi>worship of God.</hi> And to this purpose, this their Kinglike Authority (indeed intollerable <hi>usurpation</hi> and Tyranny) comes usually armed with a strong guard of Canons, and attended with <hi>metà polle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s phantasías,</hi> with a pompous train of Ceremonies, ever waiting at their heeles. For their Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime is, <hi>No Ceremonies, no Bishop.</hi> A <hi>Bishop</hi> and his <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are <hi>Relatives,</hi> and can no more be seperated one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then an <hi>Altar</hi> and a <hi>Priest.</hi> But of Ceremonies I shall have occasion to speak more anon: and therefore I am the briefer here. The Summe is, <hi>That a Prelate, as a Prelate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with his Ceremonies, which he imposeth upon the Consciences of Gods people in the worship of God, doth thereby deny Christ to be the onely King of his people, and so to be their Redeemer, as who hath freed them, as from all Leviticall and Legall Rites, so from all humane Ordinances and Devices in the worship of God.</hi> I conclude therefore, That a Prelate, by his very <hi>place, profession</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,</hi> as a Prelate, usurping domination over mens Consciences in <hi>Gods worship,</hi> by imposing his Ceremonies, denyeth <hi>Christ</hi> to be the King of his <hi>people,</hi> denyeth <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Christ,</hi> and so is a <hi>Lyer, and Antichrist;</hi> For <hi>who is a lyer, but he that denyeth Iesus to be the Christ? He is Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Case being so, that <hi>the Church of England,</hi> being a Prelaticall and Hierarchicall Church, and so for <hi>Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> ruled and Lorded over by the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates:</hi> doth thereby (as a Prelaticall Body united to Prelaticall Heads) and by subjection and <hi>conformity</hi> unto their Lordly <hi>impositions</hi> and <hi>injunctions</hi> in point of Ceremonies, and of the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> conspire with the Prelates in denying <hi>Christ</hi> to be her onely King; and so with them denying that <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Christ,</hi> is justly condemned of <hi>Antichristianisme.</hi>

            <p>I should now proceed to some other passage, but that one rub here comes in the way, and that is concerning the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> which here ye name.

               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:5075:61"/>P. Here be two things enterfeerinch each other. First, a <hi>Caution.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prelates Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, but vain evasion.</hi>
               </note> Secondly, a <hi>Condition.</hi> The <hi>Caution, That the Scripture be not forced.</hi> Take heed of that. But who shall Judge of that? Even the Same that <hi>forceth</hi> it, the Church.

                  <hi>Prelate a most notorious forcer of Scripture.</hi>
               </note> But why then doe you show your selfe so expert in <hi>forcing</hi> and <hi>misapplying</hi> the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and that most pittifully, as both hath been shewed, and will all along ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare? But however the <hi>Condition</hi> will helpe all. <hi>Forcing,</hi> or not <hi>forcing,</hi> the <hi>Church must not be bound,</hi> but that <hi>upon just and further Evidence She may revise that, which in any Case hath slipt by her:</hi> Now what is this <hi>just and further Evidence?</hi> Or what, this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising?</hi> And what this <hi>Sliping by her?</hi> I take the Sense and Summe of all to be this: That here you lay your ground to make way for <hi>an Index expurgatorious to revise.</hi> But is that all? Nay 'tis implyed, that some thing els be done: as to <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>expunge,</hi> or at least more clearely <hi>interpret</hi>; but indeed, to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge,</hi> with a <hi>Deleatur, let it be blotted out, whatsoever in any Books formerly Printed by Authority in England, hath in any Case slipped by her</hi>; or if the maine Subject <hi>of the Book be not Catholick, and consonant</hi> to the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>present Church,</hi> that they may <hi>be censured as Prohibited Bookes,</hi> and so <hi>una Litura</hi> cancelled. And withall, whatsoever you find in any Books, which you do not very well resent, to declare which be the <hi>Doctrines of the Church of England,</hi> and which private mens opinions. And 'twill be requisite, in my judgement, that you hasten this worke, to dispatch it in your <hi>time,</hi> least if you <hi>die,</hi> such another Phoenix will hardly arise out of your Ashes, that will have the <hi>courage</hi> to adventure upon these things. But among all other things, leave us not in that perplexed estate; whereinto you have brought us by your Declaration before the Articles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but make us a New Declaration, to certifie us what to <hi>beleeve,</hi> and rather resolve us plainly, that the Articles are to be taken in that <hi>sense,</hi> which agreeth with your own <hi>opinion,</hi> then that they should give an <hi>uncertain sound:</hi> for then <hi>who shall prepare himselfe to the battell?</hi> And there may be great reason, why we should preferre your Lordships <hi>opinion,</hi> before the <hi>judgement</hi> of all other those <hi>learned men</hi> that have formerly lived in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> because the Church may now

see more, and <hi>further</hi> into a Milstone, then of <hi>old;</hi> as a Dwarfe upon a Giants shoulders. And so what <hi>slippes</hi> have formerly passed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> your Lordship with your Chapleins and Divines will so <hi>revise,</hi> and <hi>repurg,</hi> as there shalbe nothing left upon <hi>record,</hi> whereby it might appeare to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that there is any such difference between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to hinder their most wished and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>reconciliation.</hi> And I think I am not in this farre wide of your Project. The Wardens of the Company of STATIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERS can tell, what you lately gave them in Charge about such a matter for the <hi>revising</hi> of <hi>Puritan</hi> Books; that so when you have <hi>purged</hi> out the Puritanism, there may be neither <hi>Purity</hi> nor <hi>Verity</hi> left.

            <p>But this your <hi>feare</hi> of <hi>Atheisme</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> to gather <hi>strength,</hi> is (say you) while the <hi>Truth is weakened by an unworthy way of contending.</hi> What <hi>Truth?</hi> Or what is that <hi>unworthy way of contending for the Truth?</hi> Or what is your <hi>Atheisme</hi> and <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi> For all these termes need your interpretation. But your prudent modestly therein we will make bold, as well as we can, to Supply. First for <hi>Truth,</hi> it is much in your <hi>mouth,</hi> I meane, the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>word Truth.</hi> But when you name <hi>Truth,</hi> you alwayes mean <hi>Falshood;</hi> as when you Speake of the <hi>Church,</hi> you meane such a <hi>Church,</hi> as is a <hi>false Church;</hi> and when you Speake of <hi>Peace,</hi> you meane such, as is a <hi>false Peace,</hi> when your <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with <hi>Rome,</hi> is a <hi>Conspiracie against Christ,</hi> and his <hi>true Church;</hi> and when you name <hi>Priest,</hi> you meane, such, as is a <hi>false Priest;</hi> and when you name <hi>Devotion,</hi> you meane such, as is a <hi>false Devotion,</hi> of <hi>humane devising:</hi> and when you name <hi>Faith as the gift of God,</hi> you meane not the <hi>true Saving Faith,</hi> whereof the Apostle speakes, where he Saith, <note n="‡" place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, your <hi>unworthy way of contending for the Truth,</hi> what

is it, but that, which the <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Thirdly, what is that <hi>Atheisme</hi> and <hi>Irreligion,</hi> which you <hi>feare</hi> will <hi>gather Strength,</hi> while the <hi>Truth is weakened by such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy way of contending</hi>? This, I take it, may be taken two wayes. Either that by <hi>Atheisme</hi> you meane the <hi>true Faith of Christ,</hi> which is opposite to the <hi>Romish faith,</hi> wherewith you hold such correspondence; for whatsoever is contrary to <hi>Romes faith,</hi> or (which is all one) your <hi>faith,</hi> is with you branded for <hi>Atheisme.</hi> Or Secondly, <hi>Atheisme,</hi> truely and properly taken gathers <hi>strength,</hi> by such an unworthy way of labouring a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation between the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which to make way for, you are glad to say, that these two <hi>Churches</hi> are <hi>for substance one and the Same Church.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your time, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though in many things it symbolized with <hi>Rome,</hi> (as hath been shewed) yet still it renounced all <hi>communion</hi> with her, as being a <hi>Strumpet,</hi> and that <hi>great Whore,</hi> whose Husband is the <hi>great Antichrist.</hi> But now you have so turned the Cat in the pan, by making way to bring the <hi>Church of England</hi> back againe to an <hi>union,</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> with <hi>Rome,</hi> that you put the <hi>people</hi> to a stand, to a <hi>nonplus,</hi> so as they know not what to <hi>beleeve,</hi> or what to <hi>think,</hi> but are ready to cast off all further thought of <hi>God,</hi> as if there were no <hi>God,</hi> because they see those to flourish, and to goe on unpunished, who overthrow the <hi>faith</hi> formerly professed in <hi>England,</hi> seting up the <hi>Romish faith</hi> againe, where it had been cast out: and on the other side, <hi>Preaching and Preachers</hi> to be put <hi>down,</hi> and the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:5075:63"/>
               <hi>true Professors</hi> to be <hi>persecuted,</hi> and thrown out of all, and forced to quit their native Countrey, and the like. Now where all this is, do you but <hi>feare, that Atheisme gathers Strength?</hi> Nay is not the root of all your cruely in <hi>persecuting Christs</hi> Ministers and People, meere <hi>Atheisme?</hi> It is noted of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> that of all other Sects they were the most cruell in their judiciall Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: As <hi>Euseb.</hi> Eccl. Hist. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 14. out of <hi>Iosephus.</hi> And no marvaile. They denyed the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and the Last <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> So as they were <hi>Atheists.</hi> This made them dare to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise all cruelty, and injustice. For <hi>Maxima peccandi illaecebra, impunitatis Spes.</hi> So, how durst you be so unjust and cruell in your <hi>oppressions</hi> and <hi>persecutions,</hi> did you certainly <hi>beleeve,</hi> that there is a Resurrection and Last Judgement, wherein you shall be Judged. But this by the way, 'tis an <hi>Item.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Irreligion</hi> also: what's that? That's soon resolved, to wit, <hi>Obstinacie in not admitting of Altars in some Churches: Irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, in not bowing to Altars, and worshiping towards the East: and adoring the name Iesus,</hi> and the like. This is with you <hi>Irreligion</hi>: because your whole <hi>Religion</hi> is placed in these things. For so you tell us in the words following.</p>
            <p>L. p. 19. <hi>The externall worship of God, in his Church, is the GREAT WITNESSE to the world, that our hearts stand right in the Service of God. Take this away, or bring it into contempt, and what light is there left to shine before men, that they may see our Devotion, and glorifie our Father, which is in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. Surely were it not for this <hi>GREAT WITNESSE</hi> (which here you bring in arayed in Capitall Letters) to wit, your <hi>externall will-worship</hi> in many devised <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> of <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Humility, Devotion,</hi> and <hi>Piety:</hi> the world could not come to know, what <hi>Religion</hi> is in your <hi>heart</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> in that <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall part</hi> of his <hi>worship,</hi> which you Speak of. But now through the cleare <hi>perspective</hi> of your <hi>bright shining Devotion</hi> without, we can discerne what <hi>Devotion</hi> is within. Herby we come to know all that <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and <hi>Apostacie,</hi> and consequenty of <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme,</hi> and <hi>Irreligion,</hi> which is in your <hi>heart.</hi> Do you set up <hi>Altars,</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> them, and set up <hi>Priests</hi> to <hi>serve at them,</hi> to which you must needs adde a <hi>Sacrifice sutable,</hi> some <hi>materiall</hi> and <hi>corporall</hi> thing? Hereby we come to know, how in your <hi>heart</hi> you <hi>deny Iesus Christ</hi> to be the <hi>onely Altar, Priest, and Sacrifice,</hi> as is shewed before. And were it not for your <hi>lowly bowing</hi> at the <hi>bare nameing</hi> of the Name <hi>Iesus,</hi> you should want witnesse to testifie to the world that deep <hi>hypocrisie</hi> in your <hi>heart,</hi> while in <hi>bowing</hi> to <hi>Iesus,</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:5075:63"/>
you <hi>persecute</hi> the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> in his <hi>Word,</hi> in his <hi>Ministers,</hi> in his <hi>Members.</hi> So as your <hi>externall ceremoniall worship</hi> is the <hi>GREAT WITNESSE</hi> to the world, that there is in you an <hi>Antichristian heart,</hi> a <hi>Popish heart,</hi> a <hi>Superstitious heart,</hi> an <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous heart,</hi> an <note n="*" place="margin">

And is not the <hi>Devotion</hi> of your <hi>heart</hi> every way as <hi>crooked?</hi> Doth not your <hi>heart bow,</hi> as, and when your <hi>body</hi> doth? And is not the Same <hi>object</hi> which your <hi>body</hi> boweth unto, the <hi>object,</hi> to which your <hi>heart boweth,</hi> and wherein your <hi>internall worship</hi> is ultimately terminated and bounded?

               <hi>In vaine they worship me, teaching for Doctrines the Precepts of Men.</hi> Now <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>glorified,</hi> or <hi>honoured</hi> with any <hi>vain worship.</hi> Nay, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he is greatly <hi>dishonoured</hi> by it. For such <hi>will-worship</hi> is a high <hi>presumption,</hi> derogating from the Majesty of <hi>God,</hi> who wilbe <hi>worshiped</hi> no otherwise, then as himselfe hath expresly <hi>commanded</hi> in his <hi>word.</hi> As the Prophet saith, <hi>And shalt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, not doing thine owne wayes, nor finding thine own pleasure:</hi> And such is all <hi>will-worship.</hi> Secondly, <hi>God</hi> is greatly <hi>dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> by such <hi>externall will-worship</hi> effectively in the Beholders. First, because when they see such a great Prelate as your selfe use such <hi>gestures</hi> in <hi>Gods</hi> Service, they are apt to imitate you, and so to partake of your <hi>sinne,</hi> as too many doe. Secondly, because in such <hi>false worship,</hi> the neerer they think to <note n="*" place="margin">

to <hi>God</hi> in imitating of you, the further off their <hi>hearts</hi> are from <hi>God,</hi> as the Prophet Speaketh. And they whose <hi>hearts</hi> are farre removed from <hi>God,</hi> cannot <hi>glorifie God.</hi> Now your <hi>will-worship,</hi> which is taught by the <hi>Precepts of men,</hi> though it seem to be very <hi>humble,</hi> and so to draw neere unto <hi>God:</hi> yet it drawes away mens <hi>hearts</hi> farre from <hi>God</hi>; as there the Prophet shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And such as behold, and affect, and imitate your devises in <hi>externall worship,</hi> they are as much puffed up with vaineglory, that they imitate and so please such a great Man, as your selfe, as they never think of <hi>glorifying God.</hi> And lastly, <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified</hi> by <hi>blind</hi> and Superstitious <hi>worshippers:</hi> but by <hi>good works</hi> springing from the inward <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> Now your <hi>blind De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi> is not to be reckoned and ranked among <hi>good works.</hi> For <hi>good works</hi> are such, and so done, as <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>commanded:</hi> but your <hi>externall worship</hi> (as you call it) being a <hi>will-worship,</hi> and so a <hi>false worship,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> no where hath <hi>commanded,</hi> but every where expressely forbidden, are no <hi>good works,</hi> but as <hi>Aug.</hi> Saith, <hi>Splendida peccata,</hi> a glaring <hi>false worship.</hi> But it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this your <hi>externall worship,</hi> the fruit of your <hi>Devotion,</hi> is all the <hi>good works</hi> you have to show, that men thereby may See what Kind of <hi>light</hi> is in you; which is not any <hi>true,</hi> but a <hi>false light.</hi>

            <p>L. ibid. <hi>This I have observed further, that no one thing hath made Conscientious men more wavering in their own minds, or more apt and easie to be drawn aside from the Sincerity of Religion professed in the Church of England, then the want of uniform and decent Order, in too many Churches of the Kingdome.</hi>

And the nature of that your <hi>Sincerity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, professed in the Church of England,</hi> duely considered, can we

marvaile, if most mens minds in the Kingdome fall a <hi>wavering</hi>; yea, and if they be truely Conscientious men indeed (not such as you meane, to wit, <hi>meere Formalists,</hi> or <hi>Newters</hi>) no marvaile if you find multitudes of them (if multitudes of such be left) to fall quite off from the <hi>Sincerity of</hi> your <hi>Religion professed in the Church of England.</hi> But if any of your Conscientious men be drawn aside: what's the Cause? <hi>Want of uniforme and decent Order in too many Churches in the Kingdome.</hi> But doe you not see on the other side a whole Nation driven aside, and that (as they Say) by your too much pressing upon them your <hi>uniforme and decent Order in all Churchs</hi> for the erecting of the <hi>Sincerity of Religion professed in the Church of England?</hi> And yet you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that you cannot set up your <hi>uniformity</hi> in <hi>too many Churches in England.</hi> Surely, ye might have done well, first to have made all <hi>uniforme</hi> at <hi>home,</hi> before you pressed too hard upon your Neighbour-Countrey. And if too many Churches in <hi>England</hi> be not <hi>uniforme,</hi> whose fault is that? Not yours, I dare say.

And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you adde.</p>
            <p>L. Ibid. <hi>To deale Clearly with your Majesty these thoughts are they, and no other, which have made me labour so much, as I have done, for Decencie and an Orderly Settlement of the externall worship of God in the Church. Now no externall action in the world can be uniform, without some Ceremonies: And these in Religion the ancienter they be, the better, so they may fit Time and Place. Too many overburthen the Service of God, and too few leave it naked,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ceremonies are the hedge, that fence the Substance of Religion from all the indignities, which Profanesse and Sacriledge too commonly put upon it. Weaknesse it is, not to see the Strength, which Ceremonies (things weake enough in themselves, God knows) adde even to Religion it selfe; but a farre greater, to see it, and yet to cry them down, All, and without choyse, by which their most hated Adversaries Climbe up, and could not cry up themselves, and their Cause, as they doe, but by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. I shall have here occasion, and that in sundry respects, to be more large upon your words. First, for the Substance of the matter, being of such moment. Secondly, for the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:5075:66"/>
of the Person, to whom you speak, his Sacred Majesty, which makes your matter of the greater Consequence: and Lasty, in respect of the Excellency of the Person <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> whose honour and regall Soveraignty is here undermined by you. For when Kings are misinformed, and miscounselled in matters of Religion especially, and that by those, whom they repose greatest confidence in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whose judgement they most rely upon, and have that high opinion of, both for Learning and Sanctity; which they conceive to be in them; 'tis a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter full of weight. And when we see the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of his Kingdome troden under foot, it will, &amp; ought to stirre up, and kindle the Zeale of every true Servant of <hi>Christ,</hi> to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his Masters <hi>honour,</hi> to the utmost of his power. Now to your words.</p>
            <p>And <hi>to deale truely with your Majesty.</hi> What els?

In this (as you say) in telling him, <hi>These thoughts are they and no other, which have made me labour so much, as I have done, for Decencie and an Orderly Settlement of the externall worship of God in the Church.</hi> Is it so? Why, a little before (if you remember) you told his Majesty that you put forth this worke, wherein you have <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed so much paines,</hi> for the <hi>vindicating of your Reputation:</hi> And now you tell him, that your <hi>thoughts for Decencie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and no other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And herein, you say, you deale Clearely with his Majesty. Did you not then deale Clearely in the rest? You have occasion now to cleare your selfe. But to let this passe; we can easily beleeve, (that setting your <hi>Reputation</hi> aside) these <hi>thoughts</hi> of yours were of greatest force with you to set upon such a worke. For I beleeve you have been no small time in hammering this Project, how to beat and fashion it to such a <hi>Decencie and Orderly Settlement of the externall worship of God in the Church of England,</hi> as you speak

            <p>But <hi>decencie</hi> is not all. Your <hi>thoughts</hi> are also for an <hi>Orderly Settlement of the externall worship of God in the Church.</hi> Why, what <hi>Settlement</hi>? Were not all things sufficiently <hi>settled</hi> (yea and <note n="*" place="margin">

prohibing all Disputes about all the Controverted Points in those Articles, and commanding to keep to the letter of the Text, which yet (as it saith) might be taken either way?

            <p>Now if I have not framed your Argument according to your mind, I desire you to mend it. But I conceive it is all that can be framed upon that test, which you alledge, so as if you argue not thus, you can make nothing at all of it, according to the Rules of Logick. Nor for answere. First, I deny, that the Apostle speakes there of the <hi>Service of God in Prayer,</hi> but onely of an <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Dencie</hi> in <hi>Prophecying,</hi> such as was then in use in the Church: as, first, that it should be done <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31.</note> one by one, and not confusedly. Secondly, <note n="‡" place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 34.</note> that <hi>women</hi> should not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to speak in the Church. Thirdly, <note n="‡" place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 27.</note> that it be not in a strange tongue, without an Interpreter. And such like. And to this hath that of the Apostle particular and immdediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order.</hi> As for Praying in the Church, the Apostle gives no other Rule but this, that it be not done in a <hi>strange tongue.</hi> Againe, we have before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Priest you speak of, from having any thing at all to doe, or meddle in <hi>Gods service,</hi> for the Reasons fore-shewed. So as if for the King and the Priest you put the Church, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. First your <hi>Prelaticall</hi> Church is a false Church, as hath beed proved, and so with your <hi>Priest</hi> is altogether excluded here from having any such <hi>power,</hi> as to ordain Ceremonies in <hi>Gods service</hi> to bind the Consciences of <hi>Gods people.</hi> For in so doing you shew your selves to be Antichrists, and Tyrants over mens <hi>soules,</hi> as before is shewed. Secondly, not even the <hi>true</hi> Churches and Congregations of <hi>Christ,</hi> the King, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and People put together, have <hi>power</hi> to ordaine and impose
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:5075:71"/>
any Ceremony in <hi>Gods service</hi> to bind the Conscience: For the Apostles themselves neither had, nor exercised any such <hi>power.</hi> We find not any one footstep of it in all the <hi>New Testament.</hi> But in this case Christians were left altogether free. And the Apostle admonisheth the Collossians, and in them all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Saying, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8.</note> 
               <hi>Beware, least any man spoyle you through Philosophy, and vaine deceit, after the Tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.</hi> And v. 16. <hi>Let no man judge you in meat, or drink, or in respect of an holy day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which are a shadow of things to come: but the body is of Christ.</hi> Let no man Judge you: that is, subject not your Conscience to Mans <hi>command</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi> in these things, as <hi>matter of Religion.</hi> And v. 20. <hi>If ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as living in the world, are subject to Ordinances, Touch not, Tast not, Handle not; which all are to perish with the using; being after the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements and Doctrine of men; which have indeed a Shew of wisedome in will-worship, and humility in neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the Satisfying of the flesh.</hi> The summe of all which is to shew, that Christians being freed by <hi>Christs death</hi> from all <hi>humane Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Traditions</hi> in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> they ought to be so <hi>mortified,</hi> as to be dead to these things, and not any more to suffer themselves in such things to be vassalized by men: which to doe, is to <hi>deny Christs death,</hi> and so to fall away from <hi>Christ,</hi> not <hi>holding the Head,</hi> that is, not <hi>holding Christ,</hi> as the Apostle Saith, v. 19. And therefore he chargeth, Saying, <note n="‡" place="margin">

               <hi>Let no man beguile your reward (or the Crowne of your victory, as the</hi>

               <hi>word imports) in a voluntary humility,</hi> &amp;c. That is, Subject not your selves to <hi>mens devises</hi> in matters of Religion, though they have never so faire <hi>pretences</hi> of <hi>voluntary humility,</hi> and <hi>devotion:</hi> for so you suffer your selves to be spoyled of your Crown, that you fight for; as <hi>Christ</hi> Saith, <note n="†" place="margin">

               <hi>Hold fast that thou hast, that no man take thy Crown.</hi> Thus we see, that it is a matter of no small moment and consequence, to be subject to Mans <hi>devises</hi> in matters of Religion, and <hi>Gods worship,</hi> when it is a denyall of <hi>Christs death,</hi> yea a falling from <hi>Christ,</hi> and so a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of our <hi>eternall Crown.</hi> And here againe on the other side, such as wilbe Masters of Ceremonies in the <hi>service of God,</hi> may take notice of their damnable <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>presumption,</hi> in daring to bring into <hi>bondage</hi> the <hi>people of God,</hi> whom <hi>Christ</hi> with his own <hi>precious blood</hi> hath <hi>redeemed</hi> from all such Slavery.

written Laws how to govern, and no otherwise, to take upon him to rule them as he <hi>list,</hi> and to yeeld what <hi>service</hi> to the King he pleaseth? Or is it <hi>decent,</hi> that one King, subordinate to a higher, as Emperour, or so, as King <hi>Herod</hi> was to <hi>Caesar Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> should presume to make Laws to bind <hi>Caesars</hi> Subjects, without any expresse warrant so to doe? Now all earthly Princes are subordinate to <hi>Christ,</hi> as his <hi>vice-gerents,</hi> who is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>

One Fetter, or Linke, or Chaine, or Bolt makes a Prisoner as sure, as many. As the Israelites were enslaved by the Aegyptian Taske-masters, as well when they were allowed Straw, as when it was denyed them. Though the bondage was the greater. But when a man is once made a Slave, who shall hinder his Master to lay as much <hi>burthen</hi> upon him, as he pleaseth? And if you have a <hi>power</hi> to impose one Ceremony, who shall stint you for more, for ten, twenty, an hundred, if you doe but say the word that too few leave the Service naked?

            <p>But in the meane time, how would <hi>too few</hi> leave your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice naked? Surely many wayes, now when I better consider it.

But (I say) your Zeale for Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies is a fiery Chariot, to carry the Jesuites to that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of their happinesse, to wit, <hi>Englands</hi> Reconciliation with <hi>Rome,</hi> which is hastened and advanced by nothing so much, as by hoysing up of <hi>Altars,</hi> and other Idolatrous Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and puting downe of good <hi>Ministers,</hi> and all true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

And then againe, here is another doubt, whether [And this he saith is very true] it be referred to the whole Sentence going before, and alledged by you; or onely to the Last Clause. If to the whole Sentence, then in Saying, <hi>And this he saith is most true</hi>; you assent, that <hi>Romes infallibility consists in the Firmitude of the Sea Apostolicke fixed there.</hi> Which you seem afterwards more expresly to contradict. But if onely to the Last Clause your Speech hath reference, <hi>And this he saith is most true:</hi> then first, you should have expressed it more Clearely
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:5075:83"/>
and punctually, as in some things you doe. But taking it in the best sense, you confesse it is most true, <hi>that the Sea Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke is fixed there:</hi> thus you give occasion of Dispute, about <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and of his being Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; and if so, whether consequently <hi>Rome</hi> be yet the Sea Apostolicke.

            <p>P. By the Latitude of this Sentence, you, or your Church of <hi>England</hi> may (as you have done) by your <hi>Declaration</hi> prefixed to your <hi>Articles of Religion</hi> (as before) bind <hi>Ministers</hi> not to preach of those <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> as <hi>Election, Predestination,</hi> &amp;c. because, though there be <hi>expresse Letter of Scripture</hi> for them, yet the <hi>Sense</hi> is so farre from being agreed upon by your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church, as that you Say plainly, <hi>they may be taken in two opposite Senses.</hi> So as upon this your <hi>Churches Declaration</hi> of the ambiguities of your <hi>Articles,</hi> you have stopped all the <hi>Ministers</hi> mouthes, <hi>binding</hi> them <hi>to peace, and externall obedience.</hi> Although I cannot yet conceive, how that <hi>Declaration</hi> should be the <hi>Church of Englands,</hi> though published in the <hi>Kings Name,</hi> and perhaps compiled in the <hi>Conclave of Canterbury.</hi> And thus also that <hi>Order</hi> for the <hi>Altar of S.</hi> GREGORIES, which yet is but <hi>Dormant</hi> in Cryptis, not published in Print, in which respect it cannot be called the <hi>Declartion of the Church,</hi> yet must be of force to <hi>bind all Ministers to Peace and Obedience</hi>; first <hi>to Peace,</hi> not to speake a word against <hi>Altars,</hi> for his <hi>Eares:</hi> and next <hi>to Obedience,</hi> that if he refuse to have an <hi>Altar</hi> set up in his <hi>Church,</hi> himselfe shalbe made a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> But why should such an <hi>Order</hi> thus bind? I must crave pardon for making <hi>Question.</hi> And the rather, because your Lordship here gives us a <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Canon</hi> saying, <hi>The Churches Declaration can bind us to Peace, and externall, Obedience, where there is no expresse Letter of Scripture, and Sense agreed on.</hi> Now though we have <hi>expresse Letter of Scripture,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Christ</hi> to be the onely <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> (as before is

shewed) yet because this <hi>sense</hi> is not agreed on by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and so by your present Church of <hi>England,</hi> therefore men must be <hi>peaceable,</hi> and <hi>obedient</hi> in that point, and quietly submit to Authority, in the <hi>admitting,</hi> and the <hi>Adoring</hi> too (if you will) of <hi>Altars</hi> in every Church. And so in all other your <hi>superstitious</hi> Ceremonies, of what force is the <hi>expresse Letter of the Scripture,</hi> where the <hi>Sense</hi> of it is not by you and your <hi>Church agreed upon?</hi> To give an Instance or two more, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> the <hi>Sense</hi> of these words is <hi>not agreed on</hi> between your <hi>Church of England,</hi> and that <hi>of Rome</hi> (though you are in <hi>Substance both one Church</hi>) what then? Ergo <hi>Ministers are bound to Peace and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> in not medling to or fro with the manner, <hi>How Christ</hi> is present in the Sacrament (though your Article of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> doth declare it, both affirmatively, and negatively, how it is, and is not) but to content themselves with <hi>Really;</hi> which is a very <hi>peaceable</hi> word, about which <hi>Rome</hi> and you have no great reason to fall at oddes. Againe, for <hi>bowing</hi> at the nameing of the Name <hi>Iesus,</hi> although you have no <hi>expresse Letter</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> for it, (no not <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. where it is Said, <hi>En to onó<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mati, In,</hi> or (as your Translation hath it) <hi>at the name of Iesus every knee should bow;</hi> but it is not Said, <hi>En to onomazethai tò onoma Iesoun,</hi> or <hi>Iesous,</hi> In <hi>the naming of the name Iesus, every knee should bow</hi>: So as that place is plainly expounded, and agreed on by other places of Scripture, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.23. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. as some of your old <hi>English Bibles</hi> note those places in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent over against the place; as in that of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> there is set in in the Margent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. all which three places unanimously shew the universall Subjection of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in <hi>heaven,</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> and under the <hi>earth</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> in the day of <hi>Iudgement</hi>) yet because this <hi>Sense</hi> is <hi>not agreed on by the present Church of England,</hi> therefore her <hi>Declaration</hi> in her <hi>Canon</hi> binds <hi>all to Peace and Obedience:</hi> to <hi>Peace,</hi> in not speaking or writing against <hi>bowing at the nameing of the name Iesus,</hi> nor in <hi>preaching</hi> to expound the Letter of <hi>Scripture (Phil.</hi> 2.10.) by the plain <hi>sense</hi> of other <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as afore cited: and to <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> by <hi>bowing</hi> themselves, when they heare that <hi>Name</hi> to be <hi>named.</hi> So as your Lordships Rule here is very usefull for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, although you have neither <hi>Letter,</hi> nor <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> for them.</p>

1. <hi>That the Church may decide and determine some things, without any evidence, or so much as a probable Testimony of holy Writ</hi>; and herein you consent and jumpe fully with that notorious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, and adversary of the once <hi>Church of England, Stapleton,</hi> whom the learned Dr. <hi>Whitakers</hi> publickly confuted in the Divinity Schooles in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as his Works can yet testifie.

            </p>
            <p>P. But what think you of it? Will you tell us there is no such thing written in the <hi>Scripture, That true Beleevers may have assurance of their owne Salvation</hi>? But if there be, why doe you forbid Preachers to meddle with it, considering the true and solid comfort which it bringeth to him that hath it?

            <p>L. p. 43. <hi>Mine is, That the beliefe of Scripture to be the word of God, and infallible, is an equall, or rather a preceding prime Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Faith, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>P. How? The <hi>Belief of Scripture to be Gods word, and infallible, no more but an equall, or rather a preceding prime Principle of Faith, with, or rather to the whole body of the Creed?</hi> This is <hi>yours</hi> (you say) <hi>your Saying.</hi> And I beleeve it to be <hi>yours.</hi> For it is as like to one of your Sayings, as may be. For here you attribute no more credit to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> then to the <hi>Creed,</hi> both equall, onely differing perhaps in point of some precedencie of time, or So, with an, <hi>or rather equall,</hi> or <hi>rather preceding,</hi> the difference not great, if any. Thus doe you not equall a <hi>Church Tradition</hi> with the <hi>Divine Scripture?</hi> For we have it by Tradition that the Apostles compiled the <hi>Creed,</hi> and each his Severall <hi>Article.</hi> And is this or any other <hi>Tradition</hi> of equall Credit with <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> And is not the <hi>Scripture</hi> the Rule, whereby the <hi>Articles of the Creed</hi> are to be interpreted, which are no otherwise to be beleeved, but as they are agreeable to the <hi>Scripture?</hi> So as (for the Purpose) if you goe no further for the Sense of the <hi>Article of Christs Descent into hell,</hi> then the very <hi>Letter of the Article,</hi> you can make no Sense of it, nor give any reason for it. And how then can you give a reason of your Faith in this particular? Except you do beleeve it, because you do beleeve it, and because the words are, <hi>He Descended into Hell.</hi> But of this more by and by.</p>
            <p>L. p. 44. <hi>Some Traditions I deny not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be Apostolicall, but yet not fundamentall in the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. You might do well to point out unto us, which be those your <hi>Apostolicall Traditions,</hi> that we may distinguish them from those <hi>Traditions,</hi> which <hi>Rome</hi> calls <hi>Apostolicall.</hi> Or rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you admit of all those as <hi>Apostolicall</hi> indeed, but yet not <hi>Fundamentall.</hi> Surely if you can prove them to be truely <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall,</hi> namely, that the Apostles delivered them immediately to the Church by word of mouth, why are they not <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall in the faith?</hi> Why are not all bound to beleeve them, or give as much Credit to them, as to the <hi>Articles of your Creed,</hi> which you Say are <hi>fundamentall in the faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>L. p. 45. <hi>The Church of England taketh the words, He descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into hell, as they are in the Creed, and beleeves them without further Dispute, and in that Sense, which the ancient Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church agreed in.</hi>

               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:5075:88"/>P. Here a Question may be moved, 1. In generall, Whether a man taking up a matter upon such trust, as he gives equall beliefe unto it, as to the Scriptures themselves, doe not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sinne damnably. As making that a <hi>fundamentall</hi> ground of his Faith, which is not found to be in the Scripture. Secondly, in particular, <hi>Whether a man resting in the very Letter of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, He descended into Hell, beleeving th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reupon, as surely as he beleeves that</hi> God <hi>is in Heaven, that</hi> Christs <hi>Soule did locally descend into Hell among the damned there, having no regard at all to what the Scripture Saith of it, whether the Scripture Say any such thing, or no: doe not hereby make way for his owne Descent into Hell?</hi> Or thirdly, <hi>Whteher you do as verily and firmly beleeve</hi> Christs <hi>Descent into Hell, as you doe his Ascent into Heaven, Seeing the Scriptures Speakes clearely and expresly of this, but not so of that; and whether you are a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> much bound to beleeve his Descent into Hell, because you find such words in the Creed, as his Ascent into Heaven, because you find it in the Scripture?</hi> Now for Answere to all these together, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that to make any thing of the necessity of Faith to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, besides what is found in the Scripture, is Sinne, and in particular to beleeve, that because it is Said in the Creed, <hi>He Descended into Hell,</hi> therefore <hi>Christ</hi> did locally in Soule des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into Hell, the place of the damned, without any proofe from <hi>Scripture,</hi> is Sin. My reasons are these: 1. Because this opens a gappe to men to beleeve <hi>humane Traditions</hi> to be of Faith to Salvation, as of equall credit and authority to the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Now it cannot be proved, that the Creed it selfe, with its forme and words, and Articles, and Title, called <hi>The Apostles Creed,</hi> is other, then a <hi>humane Tradition,</hi> or that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles composed the Creed. Secondly, This argues, as a too high estimation of a thing <hi>humane,</hi> as if it were <hi>autópistos,</hi> of <hi>selfe-Credit:</hi> so a too base estimation, and undervaluing of the <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> as if they alone were not the Rule of Faith, or not to be relie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and rested on alone for all matters concerning Christian Faith. So as to give Credit to any thing else besides the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as of equall Authority with the <hi>Scripture,</hi> (as you make your Creed to be) and not examining it by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is a <hi>detracting</hi> from the Authority of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and consequently a denying of the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the <hi>Sole Rule of Faith.</hi> For the Creed, it is either a part of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or not a part: if it be not a part of <hi>Scripture</hi> (as indeed it is not) then all the Articles of Faith in it (being but a small abridgement of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and so, of necessity, and in comparison of <hi>Scripture</hi> it selfe, very
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:5075:88"/>
obscure, and Scanty) are to be proved and illustrated from <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> the <hi>Sole Rule of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Tryall of all Truths.</hi> Thirdly, in Particular, to beleeve <hi>Christs descent</hi> in Soule <hi>into hell</hi> locally, must stand with some <hi>reason,</hi> and analogy or proportion of Faith layd downe in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> For <hi>Christ did</hi> or <hi>suffered</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the <hi>Scripture</hi> shews the Reason, Cause, and End of it. For instance: <hi>Isaiah</hi> Saith, <note n="*" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>P. But first (as is before noted, as you give accasion) why have you made your <hi>Articles</hi> to be <hi>Dípsucoi,</hi> of <hi>a double sense.</hi> So as in that respect, how can you call them <hi>Positive,</hi> being so perplexed in themselves? And againe, Whom doe you meane here, by, <hi>Wee?</hi> I suppose <hi>you and your church of England.</hi> You are contented to be Judged by <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the first</hi> 500. <hi>yeares,</hi> whether your <hi>Church-Articles</hi> be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on <hi>Scripture</hi> or not. Are you contented so indeed? Then you must be contented to undergoe the Censure of departing both from the judgement of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as disavowing them for the onely rule of Faith and Doctrines to be tryed by: and also from the joynt and constant beliefe both of <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councels</hi> within the first 500. yeares. For their joynt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and unanimous beliefe was, that nothing besides the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is to be Judge in matters of Faith. And if you want leasure to read the Fathers, doe but peruse the learned Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses and Disputes of the Divines of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> before your being a Prelate, as Dr. <hi>Carleton</hi> of the Church, <hi>De Ecclesia,</hi> Dr. <hi>Whitakers</hi> forementioned, Dr. <hi>White</hi> his way to the true Church, Dr. <hi>Bilson,</hi> yea and all those that have written of these Controversies, and they will abundantly show this, that it was ever held as a Principle, and therefore

not to be denyed, nor needfull to be proved; and which Dr. <hi>Carleton</hi> in his said Book proves never to have been altered, till in and by the Councel of <hi>Trent, That the Scripture is the sole rule of Faith.</hi> But thus <hi>you and your Church of England</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be <hi>one and the Same Church with Rome,</hi> in <hi>refusing the Scripture as the Sole Iudge of your Doctrines.</hi> But will you be <hi>judged by the joynt and constant beliefe of Fathers and Councels within the first</hi> 500. <hi>yeares, whether your Articles about Grace, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Predestination,</hi> &amp;c. bearing (as you Declare) a double and opposite sense, in their Pelagian and Arminian sense be according to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or no: If I name onely <hi>Augustine,</hi> who was <hi>Pelagionorum Malleus,</hi> that Hammer to knock down the Pelagians, both the Fathers and Councels within those first 500. yeares did joyntly and constantly professe that which he writ to be the Beliefe of the whole <hi>Church,</hi> it was so clearely and fully proved out of <hi>Scripture.</hi> In so much as you may read in the Histories of the Councels, as in <hi>Binius,</hi> how that some <hi>Councels</hi> and <hi>Bishops of Rome</hi> set downe Large Passages in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustins</hi> Tracts against the Pelagians, as the Jugement of the Catholick Church, and the particular Decrees and Acts of such and such councels.

                  </gap>rs</hi> and <hi>Councels,</hi> then you must at their Barre hold up that hand, which was a chiefe instrument in drawing up the said <hi>Declaration,</hi> which hath so enigmatized and darkened the <hi>Articles,</hi> as they have no other Light left, but a kind of twilight, which inclines rather to the night, then to the day, rather to favour the Pelagian Heresie, then the <hi>Orthodox verity.</hi> But this being your language all along, that you put not onely your <hi>Articles</hi> and the <hi>Articles of the Creed,</hi> but the <hi>Mysteries also of the Scriptures</hi> to the <hi>Iudgement</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church, Fathers, Generall Councels,</hi> we will Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sede from speaking more of it in this place.</p>
            <p>Again, where you say, that the <hi>Church</hi> was then at the best: if you understand it, during the <hi>age</hi> and <hi>time</hi> of the Apostles, 'tis most true: but if of the Succeding ages within 500. yeares, we may doubt of it, or rather resolve the contrary: unlesse you meane it comparatively to the ages after that, wherein Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ and the Mystery of Iniquity began more brightly to shine forth and display themselves in the Roman Sea, both in corruption of <hi>doctrine,</hi> and of <hi>Gods worship,</hi> beyond all excesse. For you may know, that within the <hi>space</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> 500. yeares, the <hi>Church</hi> was so <hi>overgrown</hi> and <hi>pestered</hi> with the <hi>heresie</hi> of <hi>Arius,</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:5075:92"/>
as <hi>the world groaned under it, wondering it was become an Arian</hi>; as <hi>Hierome</hi> speakes. <hi>Totus ingemuit mundus, miratus se factum esse Arianum.</hi> And among many corruptions, and much unsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Doctrine, what multitudes of Superstitious devises, and heathenish Customes, not onely crept but crowded into the <hi>service of God?</hi> Which Heathenish Rites (as we find in <hi>B. Rhenanus</hi> his <hi>Annotations</hi> upon <hi>Turtullian</hi>) were by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in a kind of carnall policie admitted, both because many ancient men being converted to <hi>Christianity</hi> (such as it was) could not easily part with their old Customes: as also that thereby they might draw other of the Gentiles to become Christians. Just such a policie, as our new Doctors, (I meane of your Church of <hi>England</hi>) have used, in a pretence at least, making us beleeve, that coming as neare as you can to the Papists in their Ceremonies, you shall thereby bring them to the Church. And surely this is the ready way either to bring Papists to your Church, or you to their Church. But (I say) the Church was so pestered with Rites and Ceremonies even in <hi>Augustins</hi> dayes, that he complained, <hi>that Christians were now in a worse case and condition, under the Gospel, then the Iewes were under the Law: for though their yoake was grievous, yet those Leviticall rites were of Gods owne ordaining, and commandement, but Christians</hi> (saith he) <hi>are brought under an intolerable yoake of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of mens devising and imposing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now on the other side, if I should enter into a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison between the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> since <hi>Luther,</hi> and those <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>ancient Churches</hi> as aforesaid, I know it would be very tedious to your Lordship and extremely move your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; especially if I should by many degrees preferre <hi>Calvin, Bez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Lastly, you say, you are content to submit to them in all those points of Doctrine.

one degree.

For if there be any <hi>light</hi> at all, it will shew it selfe. But this you will not stick to tell us anon, that the Scripture hath no light in it selfe, and therefore no mervaile if here you say, <hi>the Light that is in it is not bright enough.</hi> And you tell us here also, <hi>That the Testimony of the Holy Ghost ordinarily is not so much as considerable in this Question.</hi> Why?

Namely that <hi>faith is the gift of</hi> God, <hi>of</hi> God <hi>alone; and an infused habit, in respect whereof the Soule is meerely recipient, and that the sole infuser is the Holy Ghost</hi>? and <hi>Till the Spirit of</hi> God <hi>move the heart of man, he cannot beleeve</hi>? And now doe you come and tell us, <hi>The</hi> Holy Ghost <hi>ordinarily is not so much as conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the Question</hi>? Yea, but here you tell us, this is not the Question. What then? Namely, <hi>how the Scripture may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as a Credible Object, fit for beliefe.</hi> And for this you set us downe a rule of Proposall, which must of necessity take its rise from the Tradition, or Authority of the Present Church. Whereof we shall heare more anon. But by your leave, this is not the Question, but the other. For this your manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall, you put it not as a Question, but as an <hi>a'ítema,</hi> a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion begged, not to be argued, and disputed upon, as the nature of a Question is to be, but you doe <hi>dogmatízein,</hi> obtrude and force upon us a novell opinion of your owne devising,

And therefore we deny your Question, or Position as <hi>Heterodox,</hi> or a <hi>Paradox,</hi> contrary to the truth of <hi>God word,</hi> which is the onely rule of determining all Questions in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity about <hi>faith,</hi> whereof this is not the least, <hi>How, or by what meanes a man comes to beleeve the Scripture to be the word of God</hi>? Now for the determining herof you would tye us to the one only manner of <hi>Proposing the Scripture,</hi> as <hi>a Credible object fit for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe:</hi> and that is, <hi>necessarily to begin at the Tradition or Authority of the present Church,</hi> or els there is no dealing with you. But what if we shall propose a better manner and way of propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scripture as a Credible object fit for beliefe? And this we shall doe, <hi>God</hi> assisting, overthrowing your false way, and vindicating the onely right and true, safe and sure way, that will certainly lead us to this beliefe, <hi>That the Scripture is the word of God.</hi>

            <p>And for a ground hereof, I lay down the <hi>Contradictory</hi> of your words for my true <hi>Position,</hi> which is this, <hi>That the light which is in Scripture it selfe, is bright enough, it can and doth of it selfe beware sufficient witnesse to it selfe.</hi> For proofe hereof: The Scripture is the <hi>witnesse of Christ,</hi> as is said before: and a witnesse must be a sufficient and competent <hi>witnesse,</hi> without all exception; els 'tis rejected. Now the Scripture is without all exception, it is a <hi>holy, true,</hi> and <hi>faithfull witnesse,</hi> free from all vice, or defect. It is <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> so as it needs nothing to be added to it. So <hi>Salomon,</hi>

               <hi>If all prophecy,</hi> (that is, <hi>preach the word of God,</hi> as in that place) <hi>and there come in one that beleeveth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest, and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, and report, that God is in you of a truth.</hi> Now whence is all this Conviction, and Confession, but from the <hi>power of Gods word preached.</hi> So Heb. 4.12. <hi>The word of God is quicke and powerfull, and sharper then any two edged Sword,</hi>

Perhaps, that the Minister knew of your being there. But the contrary appeares to your selfe, you did it so secretly, as you knew none could discover it; as you want neither wit nor art to doe such a feate, if you will. Well, you can draw no other Conclusion from that your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction upon this occasion, but that sure those were the Darts of the Scripture, that <hi>wounded</hi> you, yea and <hi>sounded</hi> you, and found you out in the Croud, pulling off the veile of <hi>hypocrisie</hi> from off the the face of your Conscience, and therewithall so terrifying it, as you are perswaded all the men in the world could not have struck such terrours into your Soule: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon you are forced to Conclude, and Confesse, that surely the Scripture must needs be the <hi>word of God,</hi> having such a mighty <hi>power</hi> in it, being applyed but by a weake man. As the Apostle saith, <note n="‡" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</note> 
               <hi>We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power might be of God, and not of us.</hi> For you could discerne nothing of the Minister himselfe, but that he was a simple plain man, and did but speake, as his text led him, and for which he brought good proofe from the Scripture. Thus if your Lordship should make but such an experiment as this, would you not doe with this your Book (wherein you have, besides many other strange passages all along, as will appeare yet more at large, pronounced so many disgracefull Sentences against the Sufficiencie of the Divine Scripture, to prove it selfe to be the <hi>word of God</hi>) as those Converts in the <hi>Acts</hi> did <hi>with their Books of Curious Arts,</hi> or as you did (though against your will) with that Popish Book of the Bishop of <hi>Geneva</hi> in Smithfield. But I proceed.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Scripture,</hi> not onely in and of it selfe, but by the Ministry of it discovereth such a cleare <hi>selfe-light,</hi> as whereby even naturall men are convinced, and enforced to beleeve and confesse, that Surely the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the very <hi>word of God:</hi> so this <hi>word,</hi> this <hi>Scripture</hi> is not (as the Papists say, and you say

               </note> is as if they should abstract and seperate the <hi>light from the Sun,</hi> and say, it is not sufficient to prove it selfe to be the <hi>Sun.</hi> For indeed take away the <hi>light</hi> from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and then you may say truely, <hi>it is not bright enough to shew it selfe to be the Sun.</hi> Nay it ceaseth to be the <hi>Sun</hi> any more, when the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat</hi> of it is taken away.

            <p>L. p. 83. <hi>A man is probably led by the Authority of the present Church, as by the First informing, inducing, perswading meanes, to beleeve the Scripture to be the word of God: but when he hath stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, considered, and compared this word with it selfe, and with other writings, with the helpe of ordinary Grace, and a mind morally indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and reasonably perswaded by the voyce of the Church: the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then gives greater and higher Reasons of Credibily to it selfe, then Tradition alone could give.</hi>

            <p>P.

So then, <hi>Authority of the present Church is the Prime.</hi> Or as sometimes you call it <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> or otherwhiles, <hi>The voyce of the Present Church.</hi> All comes to one reckoning.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:5075:105"/>
this, the Scripture gives greater and higher reasons of Credibility to it selfe, then Tradition alone could give.</hi> Here's then the upshot of all (as we noted before) you by these steps advance the <hi>Scripture</hi> to a <hi>Credibility.</hi> So as all this while, you have <hi>walkt the round,</hi> and gone <hi>in a Circle,</hi> and end just where you began; for you began at <hi>Probability,</hi> and end in <hi>Credibility</hi>; whereas the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were <hi>credible</hi> at least, that is such as might be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; before you taught this <hi>new way</hi> to come to the <hi>beliefe</hi> of them. So as this your Conclusion comes to just <hi>nothing.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you seem to attribute some thing to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> being assisted with those other <hi>inducements,</hi> wherein it surpasseth your <hi>Tradition</hi> alone. Which is such a comparison and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, as you could not devise the like, to abase the Credit of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> But to conclude: What a Tedious Dispute you make here with the Jesuite about that, which (when you have done all you can) will never bring a man upon any sure grounds so much as to beleeve, that the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is the <hi>word of God:</hi> much lesse to bring him to Saving <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>Christ.</hi> But what doe I speake of Saving <hi>faith</hi>? Alas, that's <hi>no worke for your pen.</hi> You are for a Scholasticall Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute here, which is so jejune, and barren, that many Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks would hisse it out of their Schooles, much more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines out of the Divinity Schooles, as indeed nothing pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to true Divinity, but to a <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Spoyling through Philosophy and vaine deceit,</hi> as the Apostle Speakes. But the summe of all your inducements (the Prime whereof must necessarily be your present Churches <hi>Authority</hi>) amounts to this: That men being by a bond of necessity tyed to this your Church as without which he cannot come to beleeve <hi>Scripture</hi> to be <hi>Gods word:</hi> and without this beliefe, no <hi>faith</hi> of Salvation: and your <hi>Tradition</hi> with all other helps cannot bring a man to that beliefe, when all is done: the Conclusion is, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your <hi>Tradition</hi> no man can come to be Saved. So as thus by this your <hi>new Doctrines</hi> you overturne the <hi>Foundation of Faith</hi> by the very roots, leaving no footing for <hi>faith</hi> to stand upon, whereby a man may have any hope of Salvation.</p>
            <p>But I shew'd you before, a short and sure way for a man to come to this <hi>beliefe,</hi> and not onely so farre, as <hi>to beleeve the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the word of God,</hi> but to <hi>beleeve,</hi> that he hath his part of Salvation in that word. And this way is, <hi>by hearing the word of God preached. For</hi>

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> And this <hi>faith</hi> being the Saving <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> as it
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:5075:105"/>
apprehends all the <hi>Promises of God</hi> in the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be true, and to belong to him, so it comprehends the <hi>beliefe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the word of God.</hi> And this, this <hi>word of God</hi> preached and heard, is that <hi>voyce</hi> of the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> or rather <hi>Christs</hi> owne <hi>voyce</hi> in the Church, calling men, yea and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally causing, <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit effectually working in and by the <hi>word,</hi> to <hi>beleeve unto righteousnesse, and to confesse to Salvation,</hi> whatsoever is written in the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be most <hi>true,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>word of God</hi> himselfe. And besides this true Christians in all ages, never beleeved and Authority, Tradition, voyce of men simply to be any necessary prime inducement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve so much, as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the <hi>word of God.</hi>

            <p>L. p. 84. <hi>That divine light, which the Scripture, no question, hath in it self, is not kindled, till these helps come. Thy word is a Light. So David. A Light? Therefore it is as much a manifestation to it selfe, as to other things, which it shewes, but still, not till the Candle be lighted: not till there hath been a preparing instruction,</hi>

            <p>P. These words confirme your former, with a little illustration. A divine Light here you confesse to be in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> But you meane some dimme Light. At the best, not bright enough, not sufficient to shew it selfe to be the <hi>word of God.</hi> And here, That Light, whatever it is, is not kindled, till these helps come. 'Tis but a kind of Light potentially in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as fire in the flint, which must be struck out with the steele. Nay you compare it but to the light of a Candle; and yet not all that neither: for the Candle must first be lighted. The <hi>Scripture</hi> then of it selfe is but as a Candle in the box, of 12 in the pound, as you Say <hi>ibid.</hi> which hath no Light, till it be lighted. And <hi>Tradition</hi> of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church must light the Candle. And surely, then may not the <hi>Tradition</hi> of your present Church put out the light of this Candle again, after you have lighted it? As the Pope crowned the Emperour with his <hi>feet,</hi> and then struck the Crown off again with his <hi>foot,</hi> to teach the Emperour, that his Crown was at his Holinesse Devotion to dispose of as he pleased. So may you do with the <hi>Scripture,</hi> light the Candle, and put it out again.<note place="margin">

unto my feet, and a light unto my pathes.</hi> So say not you. You like not (it seems) such a <hi>lampe</hi> and <hi>light</hi> to your <hi>wayes.</hi> For <hi>wayes</hi> you leave out, as the Devil did, when he recited that <hi>Scripture,</hi> Psal. 91.11. <hi>He shall keep thee:</hi> but he left out, <hi>In all thy wayes:</hi> as Luk. 4.10. And you could never have the hap hitherto to cite <hi>Scripture</hi> right. And no marvaile if you be out of your way, when you come to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> seeing you can find no light in it to give you sufficient direction. But you Adde: <hi>A Light? Therefore it is as much a manifestation to it selfe, as to other things.</hi> Even just as much as if you had Said, <hi>A blind man seeth as much in the darke, as in the day.</hi> So 'tis here with the <hi>Scripture,</hi> for the <hi>light</hi> you allow it. And what's that? But none still, no <hi>light,</hi> till the Candle be lighted. 'Tis just so then, as I say. I guest your meaning right. But you adde: <hi>Not till there hath been a preparing Instruction, what light it is, till the Tradition of the Church and Gods grace put to it, hath cleared his understanding.</hi> How? I am here at a losse, except you helpe me out, and cleare the <hi>understanding</hi> of your <hi>words.</hi> For before, you must have the <hi>Candle first lighted:</hi> and here, you seem to grant some <hi>light,</hi> when 'tis once discovered to be a <hi>preparing instruction what light it is.</hi> I pray you my Lord deale plainly with us. Speake out. Hath the <hi>Scripture</hi> a <hi>light</hi> in it, or no, before the preparing instruction hath shewed what <hi>light</hi> it is? For to shew, what <hi>light</hi> it is, doth necessarily presuppose that there is a <hi>Light.</hi> And if there be <hi>a Light,</hi> how is it true, that you Say, <hi>Not till it be lighted by Tradition of the Church</hi>? Must <hi>Tradition</hi> doe all, both <hi>light the Candle,</hi> and also shew <hi>what light it is</hi>? Or doth <hi>Tradition</hi> with the same act of <hi>lighting the Candle,</hi> shew also <hi>what light it is</hi>? If so, then I begin through this darke lanterne of yours to discerne what <hi>light</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath: namely <hi>a borrowed light, lent it by Tradition.</hi> For you say, <hi>The Candle is not lighted, till Tradition light it.</hi> Or if I be out, 'tis for want of Cleare <hi>Light</hi> from your darke Lanthorne. But here followes a worse perplexity. For from the <hi>lighting the Candle of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> by <hi>Tradition,</hi> you come to the lighting of another Candle, namely the <hi>Clearing of the naturall mans understanding by the Tradition of the Church, and Gods grace put to it.</hi> 'Twas well you put <hi>Gods grace</hi> to it. For if the <hi>Tradition</hi> of your <hi>present Church</hi> have but <hi>Gods grace put to it,</hi> it may worke wonders. But stay. Cannot your <hi>Churches Tradition</hi> or <hi>Authority,</hi> doe the deed without <hi>Gods grace;</hi> at least doe its office of the fore-horse, as the necessary prime leader? Or is your <hi>Churches Tradition</hi> some
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:5075:106"/>
jade, that puts all the brunt upon the next horse that follows? Then you should rather give <hi>Gods Grace</hi> the Precedencie. But now I remember, this <hi>Grace of God is but an ordinary Grace,</hi> as you told us before, which at the most worketh but <hi>an ordinary morall and probable beliefe, that Scripture is the word of God,</hi> but not certaine and evident: So as the naturall mans undestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being but thus farre cleared to have a probable opinion of <hi>Scripture</hi> to be <hi>Gods word,</hi> except you can bring him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>in Christ,</hi> and forsake his <hi>sins,</hi> his opinion will but ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate his condemnation so much the more. But what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can you shew us, that your <hi>Church Tradition</hi> is certainly seconded with so much <hi>ordinary Grace?</hi> For if your <hi>Tradition</hi> be derogatory from the Credit of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> you cannot hope for the least degree of <hi>ordinary Grace</hi> to give it either <hi>assistance,</hi> or <hi>attendance.</hi> It behoves you therefore to prove, that this your <hi>Authority</hi> in this point is from <hi>God,</hi> is <hi>Gods ordinance:</hi> and if so, you may then easily perswade us, that <hi>Gods grace</hi> will accompany his owne Ordinance. But this you will hardly prove. But will Say, <hi>Traditions are Traditions, and therefore not to be proved from Scripture:</hi> and this <hi>Church-Tradition</hi> is that, which the <hi>Scripture must be proved and tryed by.</hi> And so here upon belike it is, that you conclude: <hi>So Tradition of the present Church is the first morall motive to beleeve.</hi> The <hi>Conclusion</hi> might serve the turne well enough, if you had but good <hi>logicall</hi> or <hi>rationall</hi> Premises to bring it in, better then yet you bring, for the <hi>inducing of beliefe, That Scripture is the word of God.</hi>

               <hi>the voyce of God is plainly heard in the Scripture it selfe.

            <p>P. The more you speake, the more we come to Sound the depth of your meaning.

And.

But here you bring in againe, <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> as a Second to your <hi>Tradition.</hi> But I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and tell you againe, that your present Churches <hi>Tradition</hi> hath nothing to doe with <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> nor with any Grace of <hi>God,</hi> not with common and ordinary Grace, <hi>Gods</hi> Grace is a concomitant and Assistant unto his owne Ordinance.

            </p>
            <p>But you proceed: L. p. 85. <hi>After the morall perswasion, reason, and force of the present Church, there is ground enough to move any reasonable man, that it is fit he should read the Scripture, and esteeme very reverently and highly of it.

But you proceed.</p>
            <p>L. p. 85, 86. <hi>Thirdly, you</hi> (to wit, <hi>A. C.) pretend that we make the Scripture absolutely and fully knowne</hi> Lumine suo,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>P. The <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>A. C.</hi> herein, was not without just cause; onely he considered not what the present Church of <hi>England</hi> now, under your Primacy, doth hold. So as you should or might have shaped your Answere thus: <hi>A. C. Distingue tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora:</hi> Distinguish the times. <hi>Know you not who sits now in the Chaire of</hi> Canterbury? <hi>True it is, that formerly the Church of</hi> England, <hi>or rather some private men, all or most of the Divines thereof that have written of this Subject, allthough very learned (I confesse) and of great note, place and ranke in the Church in their time, held and writ so against you: but that was onely their private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though all their Bookes were published by Authority. But what's all this to the Church of</hi> England <hi>now? Now you may heare, and understand by me, who am the voyce of the present Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>that it is otherwise. And what you doe pretend, I doe thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret: We doe not Say,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But what doe</hi> you <hi>not Say? We doe not Say that there is such a full light in Scripture, as that every man upon the first sight must yeeld to it.</hi> How? So perhaps not any hath Said. Yet this all our Orthodox Divines before you have said, <hi>That there is such a full light in Scripture, as that every man by the thorow and serious reading over of the Scripture, hath sufficient evidence therein to convince him, as to yeeld it to be the very word of God.</hi> And if he doe not therupon yeeld, the defect is not in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but in himself.<note place="margin">

               </note> But at first sight? This is a miserable shift, and poore put off, to answere fully to the Jesuites pretence, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true assertion. For in this he saith true, that we (to wit, all the Orthodox Divines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as aforesaid) do hold the <hi>Scripture</hi> absolutely and fully to be known <hi>lumine suo,</hi> by the light and <hi>testimony</hi> which it hath <hi>in,</hi> and gives to it self. Only we do not <hi>make</hi> it so (as you expresse the Jesuite) but we <hi>find, know,</hi> and <hi>beleeve</hi> it to be so. But they never said, <hi>At first

            <p>But come we to the Question as you State it. The Question is (say you) onely of such a light in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as is of force to breed <hi>faith,</hi> not to make a perfect <hi>knowledge.</hi> And what's your <hi>resolution</hi> of this Question of your own Stating? Do you yeeld thus much, that there is in the <hi>Scripture</hi> such a <hi>light,</hi> as is of force to breed <hi>faith?</hi> Nay, you have already again and again, and I know not how often expresly and flatly denyed, that there is in <hi>Scripture</hi> so much <hi>light,</hi> as of it self hath force to breed so much <hi>faith,</hi> as to <hi>beleeve it to be the word of God.</hi> And this was all the Question with you but even now. But how comes in this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, <hi>Not to make a perfect knowledge?</hi> The Question was not all this while, <hi>whether the Scripture had so full a light in it, as to make a perfect knowledge.</hi> But seeing you took this in, to cast a myst before mens eyes, that they may not so easily discern your <note n="*" place="margin">

admire the fullnesse of the Scriptures. It is a Fountaine, yea an Ocean of Knowledge.

               </note> they, so you here alledge for your <hi>faiths unclean evidence,</hi> Heb. 11.1. where the Apostle describes Faith thus: <hi>Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</hi> By which very description, it is <hi>cleare and evident, that he speakes not of that Historicall Faith of Scripture, common to all men:</hi> but of <hi>the Saving Faith peculiar to Gods Elect</hi>; Tit. 1.1. and <hi>given to the Saints.</hi> Jude 3. which notwithstanding compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends in it, the <hi>Historicall Faith of Scripture</hi> to be the <hi>word of God,</hi> and that in a higher degree and measure, then any Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate can have; even as the <hi>Rationall Soule</hi> of man being it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends in it the <hi>Sensitive faculty</hi> in a more excellent manner,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:5075:110"/>
then it is in the <hi>bruit beasts,</hi> and the <hi>Vegetative faculty</hi> in a more excellent manner, then it is in the <hi>plants;</hi> because as the <hi>sensitive</hi> and <hi>vegetative qualities</hi> of the soule of man being comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the <hi>Rationalls,</hi> are subjected to the rule and command of Reason, and so doe participate in some kind of the very nature of the Rationall <hi>faculty;</hi> man being both <hi>moving,</hi> and <hi>see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>hearing,</hi> and <hi>smelling,</hi> and <hi>tasting,</hi> and <hi>touching,</hi> not as a <hi>bruit beast,</hi> but as a Reasonable <hi>creature.</hi> So Historicall Faith, being comprehended under the Saving and Justifying Faith in a true beleever, it is in him more excellent, and advanced to a higher pitch of perfection, then it is, or can be, in a naturall man; so as it participates so farre of that <hi>plerophoría tes písteoes,</hi> that full assurance of Saving Faith, as that it not onely apprehends and beleeves the Scripture to be the <hi>word of God,</hi> but doth beleeve it so certainly and firmly, and with such an affiance and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that the Beleever will rather dye then for the terrours of <hi>death</hi> it selfe be brought to deny this <hi>truth.</hi> And what is this (trow you) but a full and certaine demonstrative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that perswades him to this? But for This Historicall Faith, in a meere naturall man, or one unregenerate, though he be sufficiently convinced in his Conscience, that the Scripture is the <hi>word of God,</hi> yet he hath neither so much affiance in it, nor affection to it, as that he wilbe content to loose <hi>life</hi> and all (if need be) for the maintenance of this <hi>truth.</hi> This full De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration he wants.</p>
            <p>But for that Faith which the Apostle speakes of and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.) which you make to be your Historicall Faith, and the <hi>evidence of it in regard of the objest, not so cleare, as being of things not seene:</hi> it is requisite here a little to consider the Apostles words. First, <hi>Faith</hi> (saith he) is <hi>e'lpizomenon vpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis,</hi> the <hi>substance,</hi> or <hi>subsistence,</hi> or <hi>confidence</hi> (at the Apostle useth the word <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.17.</note> elswhere) <hi>of things hoped for.</hi> And as some well expound it, such a Faith, as causeth the things hoped for so to subsist in our hearts, not onely in a sure expectation, but also in a degree of possession and fruition, as if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with us. And this <hi>object, of things hoped for,</hi> argues plainly, that this Faith is not your Historicall Faith, to beleeve simply <hi>that the Scripture is the word of God:</hi> but the true, lively, and Saving Faith, which hath not onely for its common object, the Scripture, but for its more <hi>proper and peculiar object, Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Promises of God in him</hi> contained in the Scriptures, which are those <hi>things hoped for,</hi>, here. Whereas your Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

Faith, as that of the Papists (as both <hi>Vega</hi> and others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme) looks onely to the <hi>common object,</hi> the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but not specially on the <hi>Promises</hi> therein contained. This (I say) is the proper worke, and <hi>object</hi> that <hi>Saving Faith</hi> doth chiefly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it selfe upon. <hi>Faith is the substance of things hoped for.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is <hi>pragmaton elegkos, ou blepoménon,</hi> the <hi>evidence,</hi> or Demonstration <hi>of things not seen:</hi> Which things not seen are also the proper <hi>object</hi> of <hi>Saving Faith,</hi> wherof it is the evidence.

As <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> upon these words commenteth: <hi>poía lèxis,</hi> saith he? What a speech or expression is this? <hi>elegkos,</hi> an evidence?

               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:5075:114"/>L. p. 88. <hi>Hooker gives a very sensible Demonstration: It is not the word of God, which doth, or possibly can assure us, that we doe well to think it is his word. For if any one Book of Scripture did give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to it, yet still the Scripture would require another to give credit unto it. So that unlesse beside the Scripture there were some thing that might assure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And this he acknowledgeth (saith Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly) is the Authority of Gods Church. Certainly Hooker gives a true and sensible Demonstration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. First, for your Author here alledged, he was (we all know) not onely a Creature, but a Champion for your Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy and Ceremonies. And besides that, his Book was guelt in some things, before it could have its passeport to travaile abroad. However (as you say of Others, so I of him) he was but a private man. And if you take his words to be the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> you may, seeing the Jesuite doth so approve of it, as also your selfe doth. Well, let <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> words be so, as you alledge them: yet give me leave to detect in them a mixture of some <hi>absurdity,</hi> and some <hi>impiety</hi> together. As in these words, <hi>It is not the word, which doth, or possibly can assure us, that we doe well to think it is his word.</hi> And so in that sense (which is the onely sense a sensible man, and sound Christian can make) 'tis true, <hi>that the Scripture neither doth, nor possibly can assure us, that we do well to think onely it is his word.</hi> For as the <hi>Scripture</hi> cannot lye, so it cannot assure us, that we do well, when we come short of our <hi>duty,</hi> as in <hi>thinking,</hi> (which is but <hi>opinion</hi>) when we should <hi>beleeve,</hi> which is <hi>Faith.</hi> For the <hi>Scripture</hi> requires a <hi>firme Faith</hi> in us, and approveth not of <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as sufficient.</p>
            <p>But now for his sensible Demonstration, which is this: <hi>That if any one book of Scripture did give testimony to all: yet still the Scripture would require another to give testimony to it; and so we can never come to assurance this way:</hi> I answere, The <hi>Scripture</hi> is a compleat <hi>body</hi> in it selfe, and every part of it an uniforme, and homogeneall <hi>member,</hi> to the making up of this <hi>body.</hi> So as the <hi>Scripture</hi> is to be taken first in the whole lumpe, or <hi>body,</hi> as bearing full witnesse to it selfe: and every part or Book of <hi>Scripture</hi> hath a witnesse in it selfe, and for it selfe, and for the rest too, there being such a sweet and full harmony in the whole, and all the parts, <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit speaking and breathing in it (as the Animall Spirits in mans <hi>body,</hi> moving the <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>every part</hi>) and shewing, that it is <hi>Gods word.</hi> And we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in this notion fever the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> from the <hi>Scripture,</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:5075:114"/>
his owne <hi>word,</hi> which it filleth in every part, as the <hi>life-blood</hi> doth the <hi>veines.</hi> So as there is not a Book of <hi>Scripture,</hi> wherein the Majesty of GOD, and his Wisdome, and Goodnesse, and Righteousnesse, and Holinesse, doe not in some degree more or lesse shine forth. And Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> might as well have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned thus: <hi>It is not the whole frame of mans body, that can perswade us, that we doe well to thinke, that it is a mans body; for though one member by its motion doth beare witnesse to the rest, that they are parts of mans body, yet still that member wants other members to beare witnesse unto it, that it is a part of mans body.</hi> As if every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar member of mans body by its inherent proper motion, were not a sufficient witnesse, not onely to all the <hi>rest of the body,</hi> that it is a living and true organicall body of man: but also to it <hi>selfe,</hi> that it is a true living member of this <hi>body.</hi> Or as thus: <hi>It is not the whole frame of heaven and earth, that can assure us, that we doe well to thinke, that God made all the world: for if any one Creature should give testimony to all the rest, yet still that Creature would require another Creature to give testimony to it, that it is one of Gods Creatures: and so we should never come to any pawse, to rest our assurance this way, that God created the whole world heaven and earth, and all the Creatures therein.</hi> Now what is there besides the Creature, that can assure us of this? What? The Authority of men, or the Tradition of the whole world? No: for <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3.</note> 
               <hi>By Faith we come to understand, that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen, were made of things which did not appeare.</hi> Now whereupon is this Faith grounded? Surely on the <hi>word of God,</hi> and confirmed abundantly by the whole frame of heaven and earth, and all the Creatures therein, not one of them, but having a stampe of the Creator upon it, to assure us, that it is his Creature. And how doe we come to be assured that this <hi>word of God</hi> is contained in the <hi>Scripture</hi>? By the Authority of the present Church? Doth <hi>Hooker</hi> Say so? Had you Said, The Ancient Church: as the Jewes, in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing for the Old Testament: and the Ancient Apostolick Church, in witnessing for the New: you had said Somthing. As also, if you had put the Ministry of the Word, for the Authority of your present Church. For (as we said before) the Ministry of the Word is <hi>Gods own voyce,</hi> which commends unto us the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as the <hi>word of God.</hi> This is <hi>Gods</hi> owne ordinary meanes to bring men to Faith, and not the Authority and Tradition of I wot not what present Church.</p>
            <p>And now against Mr <hi>Hookers</hi> sensible Demonstration, as
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:5075:115"/>
you call it: I will oppose another Demonstration, which is not onely sensible, but most true, as proving, that the testimony of Scripture to be the word of <hi>God,</hi> is in the Scripture it selfe. First, <hi>Paul</hi> in the Epistle to the <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2.</note> Romans, witnesseth, <hi>that unto the Iewes, or Israeliets under the Old Testament, were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Oracles of God:</hi> those Oracles were contained in all the severall Bookes of the Old Testament, which the Jewes kept intire, and inviolate, without the mixture of Profane Books. And of this Scripture <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, and testifieth saying, <note n="(b)" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>All Scripture is given by inspiration from God.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe giveth testimony of the Old Testament, saying to the Jewes, <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.39.</note> 
               <hi>Search the Scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternall life, and they are they which testifie of me.</hi> And what those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were, the Jewes knew well enough, for they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited with them, and they kept them as their chiefest trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. And <note n="(d)" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> also gives testimony to the Old Testament, saying of it, that <hi>Holy men of God spake, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;</hi> speaking of the Scripture expresly in that place, in the former verse. And, <note n="(e)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43.</note> 
               <hi>To Him give all the Prophets witnesse.</hi> Thus the New Testament gives testimony to the Old, that it is the <hi>word of God.</hi> And I hope you will not except against this testimony as insufficient. Againe, the New Testament gives witnesse to it selfe, that it is the <hi>word of God. Peter</hi> witnesseth of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, that <hi>Paul wrote them according to the wisdome given unto him</hi>; that is, <hi>the Holy Ghost.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> said to <hi>Peter,</hi>

               <hi>what they saw and heard;</hi> and so their record left in writing is true. See Luk. 1.2. 1 Joh. 1.3. 3 Joh. 12. And none writ the New Testament, but either Euangelists, or Apostles, all indued with the Holy Ghost. And the Wisdome of <hi>Christ</hi> reserved his beloved Disciple <hi>Iohn</hi> as the last surviver of all the rest, to write the Book of the Revelation, and to conclude, as the New Testament, so the whole Bible with that Charge. <note n="(i)" place="margin">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> also to it selfe, one Book to another,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:5075:115"/>
one Apostle to another (who were all witnesses of <hi>Christ) Christ</hi> and the Holy Ghost to all the Apostles, all their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings being guided by the Spirit of Truth, and giving joynt witnesse unto <hi>Christ,</hi> and to the truth of the Gospell. Yea and the severall parts beare witnes to themselvs. As 1 Cor. 14.37. <hi>If any man think himselfe to be a Prophet, or Spirituall, let him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the things that I write unto you, are the Commandements of the Lord.</hi> And 1 Pet. 5.12. <hi>I have written brieflly, exhorting and testifying, that this is the true Grace of God, wherein ye stand.</hi> And Joh. 20.31. <hi>These things are written, that ye might beleeve, that Iesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that beleeving ye might have life through his Name.</hi> So 1 Joh. 1.3, 4. 2 Joh. 5. 3 Joh. 12. <hi>And we also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And as the New Testament doth every where beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse both to the Old, and to it selfe, both in the whole, and every part, even by the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> that speakes and breathes in the whole and every part: So the Old Testament, in like manner beares witnesse both to it selfe, and to the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and that by many Types and Prophecies, all which are fulfilled in the New. So as these two Testaments are as <hi>Ezechiels</hi> Wheeles one within another, the New Testament being the Old revealed, and the Old the New veiled.

Why, surely they would not observe <hi>Orders. They would</hi> (notwithstanding an Order to the Contrary) <hi>preach twice every Lords day: They would open the Catechisme-points, and not content themselves with the bare words of Question and Answere, as it is in the Booke: they would hold the people so long with their preaching in the Afternoons, that they had no time left to goe to their Laudable Sports<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor could the people enjoy their pleasures with a quiet Conscience, the Ministers would so trouble them with pressing the Sanctification of the Sabbath according to the</hi> 4th <hi>Commandement, and the like.</hi> Well then, diligent Preachers they were: and they preached the <hi>word of God</hi> by <hi>expounding</hi> and <hi>applying</hi> it, <hi>which we shall heare you by and by</hi> to commend, if we may beleeve your <hi>words,</hi> when we see your <hi>deeds</hi> contrary.

But I cannot thinke them, or the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of them divinely infallible. The Antient Fathers of the Church preached farre beyond any of these of either Faction: and yet no one of them durst thinke himselfe infallible, much lesse, that whatsoever he preached, was the word of God.

If you ever took Sermons to be such; why do you continually take the Preachers themselves in your nets, and so devoure them?

            <p>But you cannot thinke Sermons <hi>divinely infallible.</hi> I thinke not such Sermons as you make. But are not those Sermons, which being a <hi>true explication</hi> and <hi>application of the the word of God,</hi> the <hi>Scripture,</hi> doe convert <hi>soules</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> doe beget <hi>faith</hi> in the <hi>hearers,</hi> and make of them new Creatures <hi>divinely infallible</hi>; can such Sermons be otherwise, then <hi>divinely infallible?</hi> I doe not meane your Court Sermons.

I speak still of <hi>true preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you put <hi>Sermons</hi> (which you say are <hi>expositions, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Scripture, and a great meanes of saving knowledge)</hi> and <hi>preachers</hi> together, whom you doe not think to be <hi>infallible,</hi> There is some difference, by your leave.

For instance: I remember <hi>Augustine</hi> tells how on a time preaching upon a text, he did, besides his purpose and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extravagate from his text, and fell upon the Manichean Heresie, which was nothing to his text, in which extravagant discourse, he notwithstanding, according to his <hi>dexterity,</hi>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:5075:121"/>
him of his <hi>error,</hi> desiring him further to instruct him in the <hi>true Faith:</hi> Hereat <hi>Augustine</hi> fell into an <hi>admiration,</hi> saying to the man, <hi>give glory to God,</hi> and never thank me for it: for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended, when I came into the Pulpit at that time, so much as to touch upon that <hi>poynt.</hi> But now I see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Gods</hi> merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hand led me out of my intended course, that I should, going out of mine owne way, bring thee into the <hi>right way.</hi> Thus we see the <hi>Sermon</hi> may be <hi>divinely infallible,</hi> when yet the Preacher himselfe was deceived. Againe, the Preacher being a man is subject to <hi>error,</hi> when yet his <hi>Sermon</hi> is <hi>infallible,</hi> being <hi>divine,</hi> that is, according to <hi>Gods word,</hi> the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and his <hi>life</hi> through <hi>infirmity</hi> may have many <hi>errors,</hi> when yet his <hi>doctrine</hi> is <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>sound,</hi> being regulated by <hi>Gods word,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is not wanting to his <hi>faithfull Servants,</hi> in his owne Ordinace.</p>
            <p>But (say you) <hi>the ancient Fathers of the Church preached beyond any of these, of either Faction: and yet no one of them durst thinke himselfe infallible, much lesse, that whatsoever he preached was the word of God.</hi> Here first you shew still your <hi>teeth,</hi> and utter your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme malice against <hi>Christ,</hi> in calling his <hi>faithfull servants,</hi> the <hi>Ministers of his word, a Faction;</hi> and such a Faction, as you yoake with that of the Jesuites.

He <hi>preached</hi> indeed every day: as <hi>Calvin</hi> did at <hi>Geneva</hi> (besides all his other weighty imployments) but what a <hi>dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> there is between their <hi>expositions,</hi> I referre to the <hi>judgement</hi> of K. <hi>Iames,</hi> who commended <hi>Calvins Commentaries,</hi> above all

those of the <hi>Ancients.</hi> So for the Greek Church (as <hi>Aug.</hi> for the Latine) that <hi>golden mouthed Chrisostome</hi> (according to his Name) the best <hi>preacher</hi> in his time, though many of his <hi>expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> were good, yet when he came to his <hi>tò u'thikòn,</hi> his <hi>morall,</hi> or <hi>application,</hi> though in it selfe it was very good, yet for the most part no way pertinent to his <hi>text</hi> he handled: but he would sometimes make his use against <hi>covetousnesse,</hi> somtimes against <hi>pride,</hi> or some other <hi>sinne,</hi> or, to <hi>exhort</hi> to some <hi>morall vertue,</hi> or other, but (I say) without any coherence to his <hi>text,</hi> for the most part. And for the most of those <hi>Antients,</hi> what was the common Theame of their <hi>preaching,</hi> but <hi>morality,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting rather to <hi>contemplate</hi> in a <hi>solitary life,</hi> then to <hi>practise</hi> such <hi>preaching,</hi> as might win <hi>soules.</hi> How few of them did <hi>preach</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of Iustification by Faith in Christ.</hi> In somuch as <hi>Bernard,</hi> who lived many hundred yeares after those <hi>ancients,</hi> and in those times, wherein he noted <hi>Antichrist</hi> to be come (which he plainly poynted out to be the Pope) did <hi>preach</hi> more soundly of this <hi>doctrine,</hi> of <hi>Iustification by Faith onely,</hi> then all those <hi>Fathers</hi> had done: if we may judge of their <hi>preaching</hi> by their <hi>writings.</hi> They spent themselves more in <hi>preaching</hi> for <hi>good works.</hi> Then to set forth the <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi>; though some flashes they had here and there. And whether this be not one reason, why you so commend the <hi>Fathers preaching,</hi> because they were so much for <hi>good works,</hi> and so little for <hi>faith,</hi> I know not. Whereas the <hi>moderne Divines</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> are most <hi>singular,</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> in seting forth the Mystery of <hi>faith,</hi> and that <hi>doctrine of Iustification</hi> thereby, therein <hi>exalting Gods grace,</hi> and excluding <hi>mans merits</hi> (though not negligent in <hi>exhorting</hi> to <hi>good works,</hi> as the fruits of <hi>faith</hi>) Those Doctrines of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> being the main substance of the Gospell, and the <hi>true practising</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> besides which there is no <hi>true preaching.</hi> Admirable they are also in seting forth the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>sinne,</hi> to bring man out of himselfe, and to <hi>plant</hi> him into <hi>Christ.</hi> And in a word, have so set forth the whole <hi>body of Divinity,</hi> as the <hi>Fathers writings</hi> to theirs, are in comparison, in respect of sound <hi>Divinity,</hi> but as a barren Field to a fruitfull, well <hi>planted,</hi> and well <hi>watered</hi> Garden. And great reason there is for this. The <hi>Fathers</hi> had to deale with some Hereticks, as with <hi>Arius,</hi> whose Mal was <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and with <hi>Pelagius,</hi> knockt down by <hi>Augustine,</hi> and others: but they knew not as yet the Mistery of <hi>iniquity:</hi> which in these latter times seeking to overtop the Gospell; and, to overthrow the Doctrine, and

               <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>the Soft and Still voyce:</hi> so he is in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is the <hi>Soft and Still voyce of God.</hi> And as <hi>Elias</hi> knew by the <hi>soft and stil voyce,</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> was in it: So we know by the <hi>Soft and Still voyce of God,</hi> the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is in it, and therein speakes unto us.

Wheron will you then hang the <hi>Credit of the Scripture?</hi> Surely it must depend <hi>upon our opinion.</hi> That's the dint of your speech.

From the <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>present Church?</hi> Alas your <hi>present Church</hi> will tell us, that the holy <hi>Trinity</hi> may be expressed <hi>in a Picture,</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> the Father may be pictured like an Old Man, because <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> is called <hi>the Ancient of dayes.</hi> For thus you pleaded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Mr. <hi>Sheruile</hi> in the Starre-Chamber, when you fined him 500. pound to the King, for defacing the Images of the <hi>Trinity</hi> in his owne Church-window, he being a Justice of Peace.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:5075:132"/>
and heard, in the preaching of it, and by <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> speaking in it) <hi>then wherein the Tradition of the Church, the present Church</hi> hath been the Prime leader. This beliefe is Hereticall and Scisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall. <hi>Ergo</hi> this beliefe in all the Apostles, Martyrs, Ancient Fathers and Doctors of the Primitive Ages, who never knew any such Tradition of the present Church, as whereon this beliefe should depend, for its necessary <hi>prime inducement,</hi> was Hereticall and Schismaticall. They constantly held (till <hi>Rome</hi> and you brought in this your blind guide, to tread down under feet the light of the Scripture and to exalt the Authority of your Antichristian Hierarchy) <hi>that the Scripture was of self-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Sufficiency to prove it selfe to be the word of God and by the hearing of it preached and read, to beget and confirme faith in al be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers</hi> without any such inducement of Church Tradition as you speake of. And therefore here you passe your <hi>sentence of condemnation</hi> of this beliefe in all those forementioned, for Hereticall and Schismaticall.

            <p>L. p. 115. <hi>So then the way lyeth thus as farre as it appeares to me) The Credit of Scripture to be Divine, reduces finally into that which we have touching God himselfe and in the same order. For as that: So this hath three main Grounds, to which all other are reducible. The First is, the Tradition of the Church: and this leads us to a Reverend perswasion of it. The Second is, light of Nature: and this shews us how necessary such a revealed Learning is, and that no other way it can be had: Nay more, that all proofes brought against any point of faith, neither are nor can be Demonstrations, but Soluble Arguments.</hi>

But our Certainty is by Faith and so voluntary, not by Knowledge of such Principles, as in the light of nature can enforce Assent whether we will or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P First here, you make the <hi>manner of the way and order of beliefe of God,</hi> and of the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be one and the same So as beliefe of <hi>Scripture</hi> to be <hi>Gods word</hi> must first be <hi>induced by the Tradition of the present Church,</hi> els it wants <hi>credit:</hi> so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>God</hi> must be in like manner and order indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; els that's without <hi>credit</hi> too.

            <p>But come we to your 3 Grounds, wherein you summe up all the Totall of all this tedious Discourse in this Section. The First is, The <hi>Tradition of the Church</hi> that's ever presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as a <hi>Prime principle,</hi> having the Precedencie before that other Principle, that <hi>Scripture is that word of God</hi>; as before. Well, what doth this Tradition? <hi>It leads us</hi> (say you) <hi>to a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend perswasion of the Scripture.</hi> This is a <hi>faire inducement.</hi> And without this, <hi>no Reverend perswasion of the Scripture can be had.</hi> Thus the <hi>Scripture</hi> must be beholden to your <hi>Tradition for a Reverend perswasion of it.</hi> And who will not have a <hi>Reverend perswasion of that, which the most Reverend Father in God commends as</hi> LAUD-<hi>able?</hi> Well, let this suffice for that.</p>
            <p>The Second is the <hi>light of Nature.</hi> Well; and what office hath that? <hi>It shews us how necessary such a revealed learning is, and that no other way it can be had.</hi> But <hi>your Revealed Learning</hi> here is somwhat obscure; we cannot well tell, whether you mean this your <hi>Revealed learning of this your present Church-Tradition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning beliefe of Scripture</hi>; or <hi>the Scripture it selfe.</hi> But be it either, or both, all is one, we doe not much stand upon it. Let it be the <hi>Scripture beleeved</hi> to be <hi>Gods word,</hi> by the first necessary Inducing cause, <hi>Tradition</hi>; as then which no other way can be had. This is then your <hi>Revealed learning,</hi> which <hi>the light of Nature shews us how necessary it is; How necessary it is, that the beliefe of Scripture to be the word of God; should be induced by Tradition, bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet doe not you tell us before, that you goe the same way with the Iesuites in advancing Church-Tradition</hi>; onely you say, <hi>you goe not so faare as they.</hi> And wherein, <hi>I pray you doe you come short of them</hi>?

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or, for all your <hi>Tradition,</hi> and <hi>the light of Nature, going before,</hi> yet not one word hath dropt from your pen, that <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (I say after all your preceding <hi>inducements) is sufficient of it selfe, to prove it selfe the word of God,</hi> but that still its <hi>Authority</hi> is <hi>precaria, at the good will of Tradition, and Authority of the present Church, whose sufficiency</hi> you preferre before the <hi>Scripture,</hi> in many respects, as hath been shewed.</p>
            <p>And you haue proceeded in this way (you say) <hi>Synthetically.</hi> What's that? That is (in the true E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>imon of the word) by way of <hi>composition,</hi> or <hi>confederation</hi> with the Jesuite, to bring both the Churches to a <hi>reconciliation,</hi> by your mutuall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crediting of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> could not be made Friends, but in consenting to put <hi>Christ</hi> to death.

For you say, <hi>It is to build up the Truth for the benefit of the Church.</hi> We have discovered before what the <hi>truth</hi> is you speak of through your Book; which is as much to say, as all that, wherein you agree with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as one and the same Church, for the benifit where of you have writ this Discourse to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the word of Truth. So as <hi>by your building up of Truth,</hi> is meant your <hi>pulling of it down</hi> with that hand, that wrote this Book.

Now this your Comparison of the <hi>morning light,</hi> let us clearely see how weake and improper it is for your purpose.

These <hi>beames</hi> (I say) are of the very same nature of that <hi>light,</hi> which is in the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and do immediately issue and spring from it, inlightning the Sky, or that part of heaven above the Horizon, which <hi>beames</hi> or <hi>morning light,</hi> as the <hi>Sunne</hi> advanceth nearer to his Rising <note n="†" place="margin">

               <hi>I cannot find that the Tradition of the present Church is of Divine and Infallible Authority.</hi> Which if you could by all the light in the Sky at noon day, find, you would be no Churle in hiding it from the world or puting it under a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell.

            </p>
            <p>P. I doe but name these your words (as before) being but an Inculcation and Confirmation of such things, as I have abundantly Confuted before. Onely this I adde. <hi>That if the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:5075:136"/>
Scripture be not before the Tradition or Authority of the present Church: whence hath the present Church this her Authority? and so whence her Testimony the Credit, to be of that absolute necessity to bring men to beleeve the Scripture to be the word of God?</hi> Must you not be forced to come into the same Circle,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Prelate in a Circle.</hi>
               </note> where a little before you found <hi>A.C.</hi> as to say (which yet you never went about to prove, to prevent the losse of your labour) the <hi>Scripture authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Church-Tradition, and Church-Tradition necessarily introduceth beliefe of Scripture to be the word of God?</hi> But if you be in this Circle, there I leave you</p>
            <p>L. p. 121. <hi>This Principle then, The Scriptures are the Oracles of God, we cannot say is cleare, and fully manifest to all men simply, and in selfe-light, for the reasons before given.</hi>

            <p>P. The <hi>Reasons we</hi> have weighed and found them <hi>too light.</hi> But to all true <hi>beleevers,</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi>; This Principle, <hi>The Scriptures are the Oracles of God, is cleare, and fully manifest, and that simply, and in selfe-light; For the reasons and proofes before given, and which all true Christians, and Saints of God Confesse.</hi>

            <p>L. ibid. <hi>Yet we say, After Tradition hath been our Introduction, the Soule that hath but ordinary Grace added to Reason, may discerne light sufficient to resolve our Faith, that the Sun is there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. As this so often repeated by you <hi>usque ad nauseam,</hi> as <hi>crambe bis cocta,</hi> Coleworts twise boyld, and to no other purpose it seemeth, but to fill the <hi>empty belly of this your volume,</hi> and to make your present Church Authority <hi>swell</hi> the bigger with its <hi>ventosity,</hi> is but a repetion of the former: So I shall not need to repeat the Refutation. Onely this: Do, or can you discerne the Sun in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> by the light of your <hi>divine Candle, your Church Tradition</hi>; And hath it not so much <hi>shining light,</hi> or is it so over-clouded or ecclipsed with the black letters, as nothing but the Authority of the present Church, must in the first place put to her hand to withdraw the Curtaine? Surely the Sun is so glorious in it selfe, as be it never so much clouded, yet that will shew day above our heads if we doe but looke up.</p>
            <p>L. ibid. <hi>Now men may be apt to thinke out of Reverence that Divinity can have no Science above it. But your own Schoole teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, that it hath: namely, The knowledge of God, and of the blessed in heaven.</hi>

so transcendent, as I hold there can be no <hi>Science</hi> above it. For what is <hi>Divinity</hi> in its native and proper Notion? <hi>Divinity</hi> in its proper Prime, and most sublime Notion, is the <hi>Deity, or God-head it</hi> selfe: <hi>Theiòtes,</hi> signifying the Divinity or Deity, the derivation from <hi>

            </p>
            <p>P. Although you use here a Schoole Distinction, <hi>Cui non subest falsum, &amp; cui non potest subesse falsum:</hi> Of <hi>Faith Historicall, and Faith Divine: Assurance generall, and Assurance particular</hi>: yet in truth in the upshot it will appeare you speake very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly, <hi>as in the Babylonish Dialect or Phrase.</hi> For first you attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <hi>Infallibility to your acquired habit of Faith, wherein is no fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood, which habit of Faith you oppose to Divine Faith, wherein no falshood can be:</hi> whereas <hi>Infallibility,</hi> in its genuine, or <hi>Gramaticall sense importeth impossibility of Error or falshood.</hi> For <hi>infallible</hi> is that which is not subject unto <hi>error,</hi> which cannot be deceived. So as you doe (under correction) very much mistake in applying your Schoole distinctions, <hi>Non subest, &amp; non potest,</hi> to <hi>Infalliblity.</hi> I remember indeed that the Schoole-men apply this Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Faith.

Look a little better in your School-men, and I beleeve you will find it so, as I say. Secondly, while you would seem to put a Difference between <hi>your acquired habit of Faith,</hi> which you expresse and instruct to be <hi>Historicall</hi> and <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which you say is onely, to <hi>beleeve</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the <hi>word of God:</hi> you doe bring both ends together, making <hi>your Acquired Faith,</hi> and <hi>Divine Faith</hi> one and the same kind, both <hi>Historicall.</hi> Onely <hi>Historicall Faith</hi> may differ respectively to the object, Humane or Divine: For it is an <hi>Historicall Faith</hi> that <hi>beleeves there is such a City as Rome,</hi> in which respect it may be called <hi>Historicall Faith humane:</hi> and it is an <hi>Historicall Faith</hi> that <hi>beleeves the Scriptures</hi> to be the <hi>word of God,</hi> in which respect it may be called <hi>Historicall Faith Divine. Divine</hi> I say, respectively to the object; but being in kind the same <hi>Historicall Faith</hi> with the other, whose object is <hi>humane.</hi> And you tell us before, <hi>that ordinary Grace and a morall perswasion, upon the necessary previous Authority and Tradition of the present Church, works this your Divine Faith.</hi> All which reacheth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to an <hi>Historicall Faith</hi>

So as this, <hi>Ordinarily,</hi> of yours, admits of no exception at all, in any case, though never so <hi>extraordinary.</hi> And thus you exclude that your <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> as it is a worke of <hi>ordinary Grace</hi> (as you call it) from being any <hi>Grace of God at all,</hi> except Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> can <hi>dubbe</hi> it for a <hi>Grace.</hi> For all <hi>Grace</hi> is one of those two kinds, I named even now: either <hi>that Grace of God, which makes a man freely accepted in Christ, which your Ordinary Grace by your own Confession doth not:</hi> or that <hi>common Grace,</hi> which is said to be <hi>freely</hi> given of <hi>God</hi> to whom he will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without the intervention or prevention of any outward meanes or respect; which your <hi>ordinary Graces</hi> cannot be: for your selfe every where professe, that no <hi>ordinary Grace,</hi> nor any thing else can worke <hi>beliefe,</hi> that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the <hi>word of God,</hi> unlesse your <hi>present Church Authority,</hi> tanquam Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia preparans ac praeveniens, <hi>as a preparing and preventing Grace, prepare the way.</hi> And thus you see to what a Confusion all your Schoole Distinctions are brought.

            <p>L. p. 128. <hi>There is a great deale of difference between The Church, and A Church: and some, between a True Church, and a

Right Church. For the Church may import in our language The onely True Church, and perhaps the root and ground of the Catholick. And this I never did grant of the Roman Church, nor never meane to doe. But A Church can imply no more, then that it is a member of the whole. And this I never did, nor never will deny, if it fall not absolutely away from Christ. That it is a True Church I granted also; but not a Right as you imposed upon me, So as, No Right, that is No Orthodox Church at Rome. And yet no newes it is, that I granted the Roman Church to be a true Church. For so much very learned Protestants have acknowledged before me; and the Truth cannot deny it. For that Church which receives the Scripture, as the Rule of Faith, though but as a partiall and imperfect Rule; and both the Sacraments as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Causes, and seales of Grace, though they adde more, and infuse these; yet cannot but be a True Church in Essence.

            <p>P. <hi>Not Right then, not Orthodox,</hi> you hold the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to be, That's somthing yet. Yet <hi>True,</hi> you <hi>ever</hi> have and <hi>will hold her to be, unlesse she absolutely fall away from the Faith.</hi> Well. And yet I wot well, you give <hi>absolutely falling away from the Faith.</hi> So large bounds, as it is to be feared, you will never come to give her for absolutely gone, and fallen away from the Faith, so long as she can have, but one bare <hi>thread</hi> or <hi>ragge</hi> of the <hi>profession</hi> of the <hi>Faith of the Creed</hi>; nay if she can but say over her <hi>Creed,</hi> though (as you Confesse elsewhere) she hath <hi>quite overthrown the sense</hi> of it. And <hi>if the sense</hi> of it be destroyed, surely the Faith of it also. This will more fully appeare as we goe along. We come to your Reasons why you hold <hi>Rome a True Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>very learned Protestants,</hi> which hold with you in this: First, we can set both as <hi>learned,</hi> and double the number of of <hi>Protestants,</hi> who will weigh down the Scale against those, that seem to be of your opinion. Secondly, we could out of those very <hi>Protestant Authors,</hi> whom you mean (though I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you seldome read such Authors, and in other things scarce name them <hi>Honoris causa</hi>) collect more against this opinion, <hi>That the Church of Rome is a true Church,</hi> then you can for it. As out of <hi>Iunius</hi> himselfe, for Instance. I mentioned before a la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Book, intituled, <hi>Babel no Bethel,</hi> never yet answered by any Jesuite, or other Priest Romish, or English, where the Author hath cleared all, or most of those Protestants, which his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries alledged, and I suppose you meane, from this opinion
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:5075:142"/>
of yours. And then also the Author proves by many conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Arguments (and in my opinion unanswerable) that the <hi>Church of Rome is no true visible Church of Christ,</hi> as having lost the very Essence of a true Church. To which Booke I referre your Lordship, could your patience but brook the Authors name, or your Conscience not tremble at the mention of him.</p>
            <p>To your Second <hi>Reason:</hi> First, I deny that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> receives the <hi>Scriptures as A Rule of Faith</hi> For first, <hi>The Rule of Faith</hi> must be in it selfe simply <hi>Divine and Infallible.</hi> But such to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> is not. For she makes the <hi>Infallibility and Divine Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> to depend upon the Church, as you do upon Church Tradition, which you confesse to be not simply <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible.</hi> Ergo <hi>Rome</hi> receives not the <hi>Scripture</hi> as <hi>A Rule of Faith.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Rome</hi> receives not, holds not <hi>The Rule of Faith:</hi> Ergo <hi>she is not a true Church</hi>; As the late Dr <hi>Carleton</hi> of <hi>Chichester</hi> in his Book of the Church hath well and learnedly proved: For not to hold the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> is to deny and destroy the <hi>Faith,</hi> and to <hi>fall absolutely away from the Foundation of Faith,</hi> and to set up a new and false <hi>Faith,</hi> upon a new and false <hi>Foundation.</hi> Nor dare, or doe you say, that <hi>Rome</hi> receives the <hi>Scripture</hi> as <hi>The Rule of Faith,</hi> but onely as <hi>A Rule of Faith,</hi> to wit, <hi>a partiall Rule,</hi> as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> calls it. But if the <hi>Scripture</hi> be (as it is) <hi>The onely Rule of Faith,</hi> and ever hath been in all <hi>ages</hi> so held, till <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Councel of Trent</hi> changed this Rule: then not to hold it so, for <hi>The Rule,</hi> that is, <hi>the onely Rule,</hi> but onely as a <hi>partiall Rule,</hi> joyned with other Rules equall to it, as her Traditions, which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in his Book <hi>de verbo Dei non scripto,</hi> calls <hi>the word of God unwritten:</hi> is to reject the onely <hi>Rule,</hi> and so to <hi>fall absolutely away from the Faith.</hi> And you confesse, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds the <hi>Scripture</hi> but as a <hi>partiall</hi> and <hi>imperfect Rule.</hi> And is this nothing with you? What is this, but to evacuate and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly make voyd the <hi>Rule,</hi> when for a <hi>perfect intire</hi> and <hi>absolute onely Rule,</hi> it is made but a <hi>partiall, imperfect,</hi> and <hi>joynt Rule?</hi> And when <hi>humane Authority</hi> is equalled with <hi>Divine: Humane Traditions</hi> with <hi>Divine Scriptures,</hi> as an <hi>equall Rule of Faith?</hi> Nay, and those her <hi>Traditions,</hi> which she calls her <hi>word of God unwritten,</hi> are such as teach things directly contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as of <hi>Purgatory, Invocation of Saints,</hi> and the like. Is not this, <hi>a'kurosai</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>to make voyd and of no Authority the Commandements of God by mens Tradition?</hi> Yet this
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:5075:142"/>
               <hi>Camel</hi> you can easily <hi>swallow,</hi> you slight this over, as a matter of nothing: as if it were all one thing in a manner to hold the <hi>Scripture The Rule of Faith,</hi> and <hi>A Rule of Faith,</hi> namely a <hi>part or piece of the Rule: The whole Rule,</hi> and <hi>a partiall Rule:</hi> The <hi>onely perfect Rule,</hi> and <hi>An imperfect Rule.</hi> All this breakes no squares with you, but that <hi>Rome</hi> for all this, holds <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi> and therfore you <hi>hold her for a true Church of Christ.</hi> But yet in so saying, you plainly imply, That if <hi>Rome</hi> held not the <hi>Rule of Faith, she is no true Church of Christ,</hi> but is <hi>absolutely fallen away from Christ the Foundation.</hi> For you give this for a Reason, that <hi>Rome is a true Church because she holds the Rule of Faith.</hi> Ergo <hi>If she hold not the Rule of Faith, she is no true Church of Christ, but is absolutely fallen away from the Faith.</hi> Whereupon I argue thus:</p>

            <p>The Minor Proposition is confessed by your Lordship, For you say, <hi>The Church of Rome holds the Scripture, but as A Rule, a Partiall Rule, an Imperfect Rule. Thus she denyeth the Scripture to be the onely, Intire, Absolute, Perfect Rule of Faith.</hi> And for the Major Proposition, you doe by necessary Consequence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it also to be true. For you set it down as a Reason, why you hold the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, because she holds <hi>the Rule of Faith, the Scripture:</hi> Implying, that to hold the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi> is one speciall note of <hi>A true Church.</hi> But now you confesse againe that <hi>Rome holds not this Rule,</hi> but as a <hi>partiall and imperfect Rule.</hi> And therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying this <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> she <hi>ceaseth to be a pure Church of Christ,</hi> And (which is the more) this <hi>the Church of Rome doth</hi> ex pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesso &amp; solemni Decreto, <hi>professedly and by solemne Decrees, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as irrefragable, and that under Anathema to be received of all.</hi> And this is farre more then to doe it by Practise onely. And yet in Practise to destroy, and overthrow, but onely some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Doctrines of <hi>Scripture,</hi> though otherwise the <hi>Scripture</hi> be <hi>professed,</hi> and <hi>confessed,</hi> in this or that particular Church, to be the intire and onely <hi>Rule of Faith:</hi> is <hi>de facto</hi> to disclaime the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:5075:143"/>
whole <hi>Scripture,</hi> and to unmake it the <hi>perfect Rule of Faith</hi>: and so thereby, such a Church, possessing such and such Errors, as are Fundamentall, that is, against the Foundation, is <hi>fallen from Christ:</hi> as hath been formerly proved. Now if but any one part of <hi>Scripture,</hi> in this or that Doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> be overthrown, so as therein it is not made the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> and this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing such Doctrines being once professed and maintained generally, in any one particular Church, makes that Church to cease to be a true Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> as not holding the <hi>Scripture intirely,</hi> but <hi>professedly overthrowing it</hi> in such and such particulars: then how much more the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing and maintaining <hi>gumne kephale,</hi> with a whores fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, that the holy <hi>Scripture</hi> is not the <hi>onely Rule of Faith, intire</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> but <hi>partiall and imperfect</hi> (as your Lordship confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth) doth thereby proclaime her selfe to all the world, to be <hi>fallen away absolutely from Christ,</hi> and so ceaseth to be a true Church of <hi>God.</hi> And denying the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the Rule of Faith, she denyeth the Foundation of the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Iesus Christ himselfe being the chiefe corner stone: and so is fallen quite from the Foundation.</hi>

            <p>Nor onely thus by Addition of another Rule, doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> overthrow the onely <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> but also by denying the selfe Authority of them; as also you doe; and withall, by tying the sense of <hi>Scripture</hi> to the interpretation of the Church, as also you doe; at least in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult places; and by holding and maintaining false Doctrines, against the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which overthrow <hi>Christ,</hi> and wherein they will not be regulated by the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; as you also doe, in your Altars, and forbidding the Doctrines of <hi>Grace</hi> to be Preached, and other things: which if the Church of <hi>England</hi> hold with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and with you, you and both your Churches are fallen absolutely <hi>from Christ,</hi> and so cease to be true Churches of <hi>God.</hi> As also your very Hierarchy makes you to be no true Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> were there nothing else; as before is <hi>sufficiently proved.</hi> And if you desire any further proofe, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no true Church of <hi>Christ</hi>; I still referre you to the forementioned Book, <hi>Babel no Bethel.</hi> And though you supprest the Book, yet ten to one, but one of your Hounds will hunt it out for you.</p>
            <p>Next, <hi>for the Sacraments:</hi> which is your second Reason: you say, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>holds both the Sacraments as instrumentall Causes and Seales of Grace, though they adde more, and misuse these:</hi>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:5075:143"/>
Ergo <hi>she cannot but be a true Church in Essence.</hi> For Answere: First, <hi>she holds them not absolutely to be Sacraments,</hi> but dependent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the <hi>Priests intention</hi>; which you mention elsewhere. And so hath the <hi>Councel of Trent</hi> defined, of the <hi>Sacraments:</hi> so <hi>Vega:</hi> so <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Secondly, if she be sure the <hi>Priests inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be not wanting, or going a wool-gathering in his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, then she makes the <hi>Sacraments</hi> to be, not Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Causes of <hi>Graces,</hi> but <hi>aitia kúria,</hi> Principall and efficient working causes of Grace, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> as they barbarously speake, by the immediate vertue of the worke wrought. So the <hi>Councel of Trent</hi> also. So as they shut out the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> from this worke, as the Principall Efficient worker and sealer of <hi>Grace.</hi> Thirdly, For <hi>Baptisme,</hi> which you make to be an <hi>Infallible Marke</hi> of that Church to be <hi>Christian,</hi> besides their infinite corruptions of the Element of <hi>water,</hi> (which the Apostle calleth <hi>pure water</hi>) with their <hi>spittle, salt, creame, exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cismes,</hi> or <hi>conjurations</hi> of the <hi>Devils insultations,</hi> and the like, they hang the very <hi>beeing,</hi> not onely the <hi>vertue,</hi> of this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> upon the <hi>Priests intention,</hi> which <hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>Priest</hi> is so uncertaine, as <hi>Vega</hi> (one of the prime Sticklers in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Trent,</hi> as aforesaid, in his Booke upon the <hi>Councel of Trent, especially the sixt Session,</hi> where he treateth of <hi>certainty of Faith, in Iustification,</hi> Confesseth, that there can be <hi>no certainty of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a man, because he cannot be certain,</hi> whether he hath true <hi>Baptisme</hi> or no; and that in regard of the <hi>Priests intention,</hi> whereof he cannot be certaine: So as by this their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>no one Papist can be sure, that he is a Christian:</hi> and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, neither can all the members of that Church seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, nor conjunctly the whole Body it selfe, be sure whether they, or it be <hi>Christian</hi> or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon this very ground, cannot resolve <hi>certainly,</hi> whether she be a Church of <hi>Christ</hi> or no; unlesse your Testimony will help her out at a dead lift. And that not onely in regard of the <hi>Priests intention</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament of Baptisme,</hi> but also in their Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Sacrament of Orders, one of these more, which they have added to the two. So as for default of the Popes <hi>intention</hi> in <hi>ordering of Prelates,</hi> or of the <hi>Prelates invention</hi> in <hi>ordering</hi> one another, and in <hi>ordering of Priests,</hi> and of <hi>Priests intention,</hi> in Consecrating their <hi>Sacrament of Baptisme</hi> (as themselves, <hi>Vega</hi> and others, do argue the case) they are all put to the stagger, whether they have in that Church either <hi>Priesthood, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> For all hangs upon that weake <hi>pin,</hi> or <hi>haire,</hi> of the <hi>Priests

intention.</hi> So as another of their Primipili, a Standard-bearer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Dominicans, in the same Councell, <hi>Dominicus Soto</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned) in his Book <hi>de natura &amp; gratia,</hi> saith, that, <hi>Deus in potestate Sacerdotis posuit Populi salutem,</hi> GOD hath put the peoples Salvation in the Priests power. Now all this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and withall, the time, when this was made a Decree, in the <hi>Councel of Trent,</hi> a matter of 100 yeares agoe, and when it was but new, and the Pope and Prelates, and Priests could not perhaps, of a good while learne their lesson perfectly, and so get a habit of it, but that in all their Consecration of Prelates, and Priests, still <hi>intention</hi> was to seek, and where it breakes off, as in the Pope and Prelates, in their Consecration of Orders, there followes a meere nullity in succession of the whole Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Priests downwards, and so through that whole body no Priesthood now, no Sacraments: what evidence can the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now give us, or what assurance can she have (besides the bare name) That she is still a Christian Church? Onely <hi>Vega</hi> helps it, aswell as he can, <hi>That in reason and Charity men are not to thinke, that the Priest should be so carelesse at the Consecration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as not to look to his Intention, upon which the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly for the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> or of the <hi>Altar,</hi> as they call it: First this is in the same Predicament with <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi> for the <hi>Priests intention,</hi> which if not present, at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of the <hi>Host</hi> (as they call it) there is no <hi>Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> no <hi>body of Christ,</hi> and so they worship, a <hi>wafer</hi> instead of <hi>Christ,</hi> and so by their owne Confession, in that case they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit materiall Idolatry, as a <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> Jesuite confessed in Dispute with Dr <hi>Featly.</hi> But Secondly, by the very name of <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Altar,</hi> they destroy the <hi>Sacrament</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> ordained in his last Supper, called therfore <note n="‡" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20.</note> 
               <hi>the Supper of the Lord.</hi> For they have turned it from a Supper, to a <hi>sacrifice,</hi> yea and that from an <hi>Eucharisticall sacrifice</hi> (as the Fathers called it) to a <hi>Propitiatory sacrifice,</hi> for the <hi>sins of quick and dead</hi>; as is noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And so this <hi>Sacrament</hi> they have <hi>Non sacramented,</hi> and made of it a <hi>whole burnt sacrifice.</hi> Secondly, they have utterly destroyed the materialls, or <hi>Element</hi> in this their <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> that no ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e is neither. And so it is neither <hi>Supper</hi> nor <hi>Sacrament.</hi> And thus they have taken away, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> onely the <hi>cup</hi> from the <hi>people,</hi> but the <hi>bread</hi> also, altogether. So as there

is nothing in their <hi>Sacrament</hi> but a meere lye, meere imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Phantasmes of Accidents without subject; as we said before. And so enough of this.</p>
            <p>And lastly, the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> having disanulled the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Grace, it hath withall disabled them from being <hi>seales of Grace.</hi> For it is the property of a <hi>seale</hi> to give a sure and certain Impression, and thereby a Confirmation of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> But in Popish <hi>Sacraments</hi> all certainty is taken away, as is shewed; and so having lost the <hi>seales,</hi> consequently the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>of Grace</hi> it selfe is of no force unto them. And thus, in denying the two <hi>Testaments</hi> to be the onely <hi>rule of Faith,</hi> and overthrowing the <hi>two Sacraments</hi> the <hi>seales of Faith</hi>; yea having lost and disclaimed the <hi>true Saving Faith it selfe:</hi> what evidence hath <hi>Rome</hi> left her to shew and prove, that she is now a <hi>true Church of Christ,</hi> or hath the <hi>Essence of a true Church?</hi> Let her shew her <hi>evidence.</hi> As he said, <note n="*" place="margin">

This passage I cited before in my Preface to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, yet I here recite it again, because perhaps all wilbe little enough to put you in mind therof: For as I told you before, the Greatnesse of the Cause hath caused my stile and Spirit to mount upon the wings of <hi>zeale</hi> for my <hi>Christ,</hi> and for his <hi>Church</hi> in a higher degree and strain then ordinary. And that for this you Censure me <hi>of insolence or madnesse</hi> (as I feare it wilbe the best defence you can make for your Cause alwayes excepted the Bill in Starre-Chamber) I have no remedy, but <hi>patience,</hi> committing the Cause to him that judgeth rightly. And as I have done it for the finding out of the <hi>truth,</hi> so this hath caused me a great deale of moyle in digging and removing away a masse of earth and rubbedge, which you had cast, to hide this Treasure from us. So as a <hi>purposed opposition was not it,</hi> that set me upon this <hi>Great taske,</hi> but yet I oppose you, and purpose to detect your <hi>falsities</hi> so fairly guilded over with <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> that you might not impose too much upon your Credulous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. You aledge for this purpose the Example of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing a Case with <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which you say <hi>all men know.</hi> But my Lord, I suppose all men do not know it. And because it is a matter both worthy, and not unnecessary for all men to know it: I will take occasion here to speake somthing of it, as not impertinent also to our present purpose.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of the second Century, there was a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the <hi>Asian Church,</hi> and the <hi>Roman,</hi> about the Day of Celebrating the memory of the <hi>Lords Resurrection.</hi> The <hi>contention</hi> grew hot (as commonly men are most eagre in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding their own <hi>devises</hi> in matter of Religion) so as, because the Asian Churches would not conforme to <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he began to fume and to thunder, and threaten them all with Excommunication. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who lived in <hi>France,</hi> for this reproves <hi>Victor,</hi> telling him, that he ought not to proceed and deale so with Asian Churches for such differences, as were of things at that time accounted Indifferent. <hi>Some,</hi> saith he, <hi>fast one day before Easter; some, two; some, more; some,</hi>

And thus they communicated together; and in the Church or Congregation</hi> Anicetus <hi>gave the Eucharist to</hi> Polycarpus <hi>out of a reverent respect, and so they dismissed each other in peace, and in all Churches, but those that observed it, and those that observed it not, had peace one with another.</hi> And thus <hi>Irenaeus pherònumos tìs,</hi> according to his Name, became a Peace-maker to all the Churches.

            </p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, to apply these things: Hereby you may see, how things in their own nature <hi>indifferent,</hi> ought to be left free, and not to be made burthens and bonds to mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; that so <hi>Christian Liberty and Peace,</hi> may be preserved inviolate. You see, how those ancient Bishops or Presbyters of <hi>Rome,</hi> bound not this <hi>liberty,</hi> brake not this <hi>peace.</hi> You see, how <hi>Victor</hi> presuming to violate both, yet upon the reproofe of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (though inferiour to him in place) he yeelded to <hi>reason,</hi> suffered not <hi>pride</hi> or <hi>passion</hi> to predominate, but left to the Churches both their <hi>Liberty and Peace.</hi> But now for you my Lord, you are not contented onely to impose with rigour upon mens Consciences those Ceremonies which you other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise call Indifferent, yet enforce them as necessary as being also by mans Laws Commanded, and such, as in point of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie</hi> might justly be questioned, were they not <hi>superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi> but also in erecting and imposing, both <hi>besides Mans Law,</hi> and <hi>against Gods Law,</hi> other both <hi>idolatrous</hi> and <hi>superstitious</hi> devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (as your stone or woodden <hi>Altars,</hi> with their Equipage, and service in <hi>adorations,</hi> and the like) and those borrowed from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her selfe, none (since <hi>Victor</hi>) infinitely corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and deeply deceived, yea drowned in all <hi>Idolatries and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions</hi>; which have been of late so violently and universally pressed upon all Churches within your Reach, that what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions or combustions it may further cause, the <hi>Lord knows:</hi> But this we are sure of, that as the <hi>liberty</hi> of Mens Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is hereby generally brought into bondage, and both the outward and inward peace of the Churches violated, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to pieces, while you cry for <hi>peace,</hi> and cease not to presse your <hi>Vniversall Conformity,</hi> as if it were the way of <hi>quenching the flame, to poure out the Oyle</hi> of a meere nominall Peace: so the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:5075:149"/>
Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the salvation of Christian mens soules is hereby utterly subverted, as formerly is shewed. And of these things you have been sufficiently admonished, and convinced by some Ministers of <hi>Christ.</hi> But you say, <hi>It was too roughly done, not as Irenaeus reproved Victor.</hi> Is that all?

Nay you, though both <hi>victus &amp; convictus,</hi> vanquished and convinced in your Conscience and knowledge of the <hi>truth</hi> of all those enormities which you were charged withall, yet you must be <hi>Victor,</hi> not resting till you had sent away your Reprover with a Censure more bitter, and sharper then the sharp reproofe could be; and yet not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting from your violent course to enforce an Universall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, whereby the whole Land is infected with terrible combustions, and those no lesse further dangerous, then already full of dammage.

So as your <hi>Militant</hi> Church is properly so called, for no other reason, but because it makes Warre against <hi>Christ and his Saints,</hi> Rev. 12.7. and 13.7. and 16.14. and 17.14. but the <hi>true Militant</hi> Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> is so called, because she fights <hi>spiritually</hi> under <hi>Christs</hi> banner against Sinne, the World, the Flesh, the Devil, and cruell Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters, whom <note n="‡" place="margin">

This <hi>sabbatisme</hi> (as the other) is the <hi>rest of God.</hi>

               <hi>His Rest,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> This <hi>Sabbatisme</hi> in the Church <hi>Militant</hi> is by <hi>God</hi> himselfe appointed to be solemnly observed of the <hi>whole Congregation</hi> on that <hi>seventh day of the week,</hi> wheron himselfe <hi>rested.</hi> This <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>rest</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was on the <hi>seventh</hi> or last day of the week, upon the finishing of the worke of <hi>creation.</hi> And therfore, for that very cause, <hi>God</hi> commanded his People in the Old <hi>Testament</hi> to sanctifie that <hi>Sabbath day</hi> weekly. This is given as the Reason of its sanctification by the People: <hi>The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: For in six d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:5075:150"/>
or last day of the week:</hi> but <hi>Remember to sanctifie the Sabbath day.</hi> These words are the <hi>Morall substance of the Commandement.</hi> The rest is an exposition and application of it, the exposition to keep <hi>holy that Day</hi> for <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which is the <hi>Lords</hi> own <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> wherein himselfe hath <hi>rested. Note this well</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I will speak much here in few words. Weigh them therfore, number them not. The particular application of the <hi>seventh</hi> or <hi>last day</hi> of the <hi>week,</hi> as wherein <hi>God rested from his works of Creation,</hi> is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and commanded to <hi>Gods people</hi> under the Old <hi>Testament.</hi> So as if there had not come in afterwards, a more glorious <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> or <hi>rest</hi> of <hi>Gods,</hi> as from a more <hi>glorious worke</hi> of a more <hi>glorious Creation:</hi> we Christians also should have kept that <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day</hi> that the Jewes kept. But that this more <hi>glorious day</hi> of a more <hi>glorious rest</hi> of <hi>God</hi> from a more <hi>glorious worke,</hi> being come: then the same 4<hi>th Commandement</hi> commands us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to keep this <hi>new Day of Rest,</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God.</hi> So as though the Day be changed, yet the <hi>Commandement</hi> is the same. It binds <hi>us still to sanctifie the Sabbath of the Lord our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, for the application of the 4<hi>th Commandement</hi> to us Christians. <hi>Remember to keep the Sabbath day holy.</hi> What <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day?</hi> Or what day for <hi>Sabbath?</hi> The <hi>Sabbath day of the Lord thy God, wherein himselfe rested.</hi> What day is that? The <hi>first day of the weeke.</hi> This is another <hi>seventh day,</hi> reckoning the weeke backward. Now on this first day of the week <hi>the Lord our God Iesus Christ,</hi> after that he had finished the <hi>worke of Redemption</hi> (being a <hi>new Creation,</hi> and much more glorious then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in many respects) rose againe from the dead, and so entred into his Rest that morning and moment of his Rising again. He entred then I say into the state of Rest, though not into the place of Rest, till his <hi>Ascension.</hi> This is sufficient. But the work of <hi>Redemption</hi> was finished on the Crosse. Not altogether<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the Crosse, <hi>Christ</hi> indured and finished his suffering of the pangs and paines of <hi>death,</hi> when he said <hi>Consummatum est,</hi> It is finished: but there remained the bonds of <hi>death</hi> to be indured, and that was in the grave 3 dayes, to <hi>redeem</hi> us, aswell our <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> from the <hi>grave,</hi> as our <hi>soules</hi> from <hi>hell</hi> on the Crosse. Now all this being finished, to wit, the whole <hi>worke of Redemtion: Christ</hi> rising the 3<hi>d</hi> day, therein <hi>rested from his worke.</hi> And this being the <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Rest of the Lord our God,</hi> surpassing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Rest</hi> in <hi>glory,</hi> and into which <hi>rest</hi> or <hi>sabbatisme</hi> all beleeving Christians do enter, and have an Interest (as Heb. 4.3.) it
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:5075:151"/>
follows necessarily, that as by <hi>Christs</hi> example of Resting on that day, as by his <hi>Commandement</hi> to keep the Sabbath day of the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> wherein himselfe hath <hi>rested,</hi> that we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians do sanctifie the <hi>Lords day,</hi> the first day of the week, for our Christian Sabbath day, according to the 4<hi>th Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Which if we doe not, as not holding our selves bound by the 4<hi>th Commandement:</hi> Then all these errors in the <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> follow upon it:</p>
            <p>As first, by not sanctifying the <hi>Lords day</hi> for our Christian Sabbath day, we utterly deny, overthrow and destroy the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> of the 4<hi>th Commandement,</hi> which to the <hi>Militant</hi> Church on earth stands in this, <hi>To sanctifie the Sabbath day of the Lord our God.</hi> It commands us this, or nothing; and if nothing, it lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth both the Nature and Name of a <hi>Commandement.</hi> And if you doe acknowledge and beleeve it to be (as it is) one of <hi>Gods ten Morall Commandements:</hi> then of necessity you must either sanctifie the <hi>first day</hi> of the <hi>week</hi> for Sabbath, whereon <hi>Christ</hi> arose and <hi>rested:</hi> or else, you must sanctifie that <hi>seventh day</hi> of the Old <hi>Testament,</hi> which <hi>God rested</hi> on from his <hi>worke of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> which the Jewes observed. And if you keep the Jewes Sabbath, you must turn Jew, and deny <hi>Christ</hi> to be come in the flesh. For in <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Deuteronomy God</hi> commands them to keep the Sabbath day, in memory of their Redemption from <hi>Aegipt</hi>; and so their Sabbath day was turned into a type of another Sabbath or Rest, that was to be brought in upon the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of our spirituall Redemption. Which being now finished, that typicall Sabbath is vanished, being the last Type which was fulfilled by <hi>Christ,</hi> resting in his Grave on that day, and so utterly abolished in that more glorious Rest of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. If then you keep the Jewes Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you do with them deny <hi>Christ</hi> to be come. And if you sanctifie not the <hi>first day of the weeke,</hi> instead of, and succeding in place of the old Sabbath day: then as you utterly deny and destroy the 4<hi>th Commandement,</hi> so you deny the worke of <hi>Redemption</hi> finished on the Crosse and in the Grave: you deny his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> wherein he rested from that worke: and you deny the very <hi>rest</hi> of <hi>heaven:</hi> and you deny the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> both in the Church <hi>Militant</hi> and <hi>Triumphant.</hi> First you deny the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the worke of <hi>Redemption</hi> on the Crosse, and in the <hi>Redemption</hi> it selfe, in denying the Rest of <hi>Christ</hi> in the day of his <hi>Resurrection.</hi> For if he then rested not, the <hi>worke of Redemption</hi> was not finished. And you deny he <hi>rested,</hi> in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:5075:151"/>
his <hi>rest</hi> to be the <hi>rest</hi> of the <hi>Lord our God,</hi> which the 4<hi>th Commandement</hi> commands us Christians to keepe weekly on that day; which if we keep not, <hi>Christ</hi> hath not <hi>rested,</hi> and so he hath not <hi>redeemed</hi> us. Secondly, in denying <hi>Christs rest,</hi> you deny his <hi>Resurrection.</hi> For if he <hi>rested</hi> not, he <hi>arose</hi> not. For the very first moment of his <hi>Resurrection</hi> began his <hi>rest.</hi> If then you sanctifie not the Day of his <hi>rest</hi> for the Christian Sabbath day, you deny as <hi>Christs rest,</hi> so his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and the whole ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it, by which we arise from Sinne <hi>spiritually,</hi> and from the Grave <hi>corporally.</hi> And <hi>cursed is he, that hath not his part in the first Resurrection: for on him the second death, that is, eternall death shall have power:</hi> because <note n="*" place="margin">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while you deny that day to be the holy <hi>rest,</hi> or Sabbath day of Christians, you deny, as <hi>Christs eternall rest</hi> in <hi>heaven,</hi> so that <hi>rest,</hi> or <hi>sabbatisme,</hi> which remaines for the <hi>people of God.</hi> As the <note n="‡" place="margin">

            <p>L. ibid. <hi>The Kings and the Church of England had no reason to admit of a publick Dispute with the English Romish Clergy, till they should be able to shew it under the Seale, or Powers of Rome, That that Church will submit to a third, who may be an Indifferent Iudge between us and them; or to such a Generall Councel, as is after menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P.

And you tell us before, <hi>that the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land knows well, that a Parliament cannot be called at all times.</hi> Nor will the Powers of <hi>Rome</hi> permit their Religion to be dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on. And whom will you chuse to <hi>dispute</hi> with them? some peaceable men, that will not be apt to fall out with the Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, your Lordship being <hi>Moderator.</hi> But you know <hi>Rome</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> the <hi>Scripture.</hi> And <hi>Contra negantem Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipia non est disputandum.</hi> Who shall else be the Umpier? Who the Third? Who the <hi>Indifferent Iudge?</hi> Could both the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> joyntly chuse a more <hi>Indifferent Iudge,</hi> then your selfe? Sure <hi>Rome</hi> her selfe would nominate you before <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe if he were living. A <hi>Generall Councel</hi> indeed of <hi>Romish, English,</hi> and other <hi>Prelates,</hi> might do much: so you should be sure to exclude all the <hi>Protestant Reformed Churches</hi> for <hi>wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Franciscus à S. Clara</hi> well adviseth.

But you adde.</p>
            <p>L. p. ibid. and 146. <hi>And this is an honest, and I think a full Answer. And without this, all Disputation must end in a clamour; and therfore the more publick the worse, because as the Clamour is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so perhaps wilbe the Schisme too.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:5075:154"/>P Nay, my Lord, if you stand upon termes of honesty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, you should have nominated the <hi>Scripture</hi> for the onely <hi>sufficient</hi> and <hi>upright Iudge</hi> between you.

But if your Answere were not in this respect <hi>honest,</hi> I must tell you, neither was it <hi>full,</hi> but an empty and frivolous Answere. To <hi>dispute</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> where <hi>Scripture</hi> is not the onely <hi>Iudge,</hi> is as to judge of gold by the colour, without the <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi> And so he that could shew the <hi>best colour</hi> for his <hi>matter</hi> by a <hi>false light,</hi> should carry it away.

            <p>Againe, I cannot but a little wonder, that your Lordship should so grosly forget your selfe, as because of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or two to give such a state the stile of a <hi>true Church of God.</hi> For do you any where allow a <hi>true Church,</hi> which hath no <hi>Priests?</hi> And it is cleare, that <hi>Israel</hi> then had no <hi>true Priests,</hi> but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, such as <hi>Rome</hi> now hath. So in this respect rather I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you mean that was then a <hi>true Church,</hi> because of their <hi>Priests,</hi> such as they were, <hi>Baalish,</hi> such as your <hi>Babylonish Priests,</hi> as good an Argument to prove <hi>Rome</hi> a <hi>true Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you alledge, there were thousands among them, that had not bowed knees to <hi>Baal.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>God</hi> told <hi>Elias,</hi> when he complained he <hi>was left alone,</hi> that he had <hi>reserved to himselfe</hi> 7000. <hi>that had not bowed the knee to Baal, nor kissed his mouth.</hi> But they were all so hid, that (you see) the <hi>Prophet</hi> himselfe knew no such thing, till the <hi>Lord</hi> told him. They made no open profession of the <hi>true Religion.</hi> And if they had any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meetings to pray together, and to read and expound the Law, will your Lordship call that a Church, Though those Assemblies were indeed the <hi>true Churches of God.</hi> But would not you, if you had been in <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Priests stead, have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led those private meetings <hi>Conventicles,</hi> and would have hunted them out with your <hi>Pursuivants?</hi> And therefore those <hi>seven thousand</hi> not being of the <hi>Kings Religion,</hi> nor <hi>Communion Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall</hi> with the other many <hi>thousands of Israel,</hi> and lying hid in Corners here and there, they would not denominate the whole state of the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> a <hi>true visible Church of God,</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves living as it were <hi>invisible,</hi> at least so <hi>invisible,</hi> as though others took notice of their Persons, where they conversed, yet they saw not their <hi>Religion,</hi> for themselves durst not openly professe it. So as those <hi>seven thousand</hi> I cannot more fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, then to those, whom you call a sort of Puritanicall Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists, whom you by your <hi>Altar services</hi> and other superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons drive from your <hi>Communion,</hi> who will not <hi>bow the knee</hi> to your <hi>Baal,</hi> to your <hi>God-Altar,</hi> nor at your Name <hi>Iesus,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you Ferret them out of their <hi>holes,</hi> because they will not do as their Neighbours do, goe with them like loving Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and good Fellows to <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Dan,</hi> and there make merry, <hi>eat, drinke before their God, and rise up to play,</hi> as you give

your people leave to doe on their Holy dayes, and on the <hi>Lords dayes</hi> too. Onely here is the difference, it seemeth that in those dayes of old of the <hi>ten Tribes, there were no Pursuivants</hi> to hunt out those poore Snakes, that lurked in holes, and would not <hi>bow</hi> the <hi>knee.</hi> For then sure <hi>Elias</hi> should have heard of them, and they should have been served with the same sawce, that the <hi>Lords Prophets</hi> tasted of. And again, there was in <hi>Israel</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one good <hi>Obadiah,</hi> that hid an hundred of the <hi>Lords Prophets</hi> in a Cave from wicked <hi>Iezebel,</hi> as there was in <hi>Iudah</hi> a good <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>P. As <hi>worthy</hi> as your <hi>predecessor Anselme</hi> was, and though now one of <hi>Romes</hi> Saints, yet he was against your Priests Marriage. But perhaps therfore the more <hi>worthy.</hi> And he was so holy, it seems, that he said he never repented him of any thing in all his life, but about the eating of some Fish one time.

And so the Popedome it selfe, the Throne of the Beast was erected <hi>in Schismatis remedium:</hi> for the onely Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of all Schisme. And it is to be noted how these two Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates strove for this <hi>supremacy,</hi> and both under the veile of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.

And we see in <hi>Gregories</hi> Registrum, in sundry of his Epistles, how low he descends in most base flattery to that <hi>Parricide Phocas,</hi> and his Empres, to visit the thresholds of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. But what will not Episcopall <hi>zeale</hi> doe for the Hierarchy? But thus he kept <hi>Iohn</hi> off: and so made way for his own Prophecy which was, <hi>Filius superbiae prope est.</hi> The son of <hi>pride</hi> (that is <hi>Antichrist</hi>) is neere at hand. And neerer surely, then he was aware. For <hi>Gregory</hi> deceasing; and <hi>Sabianus</hi> succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and siting but one yeare: <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. the next successor obtaind this Title of <hi>Phocas:</hi> and so each confirmed other, the Emperour the Pope in the Throne of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> which is a Tyranny over mens Soules: and the Pope the Emperours Cruelty in a Tyranny over mens Bodyes. And thus came that Prophecy of the Angel (Revel. 17.18) to be fulfilled, <hi>The Woman which thou sawest is that great City, which reigned over the Kings of the Earth.</hi> As <hi>Rome</hi> then did in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time.

brought in a necessity of your new Catholicke <hi>Militant Church,</hi> consisting of the Prelacy, or Hierarchy, which is so one, as one must be <hi>Ordine primus,</hi> as generall of the whole Army, as the <hi>Dragon and his Angels to warre against Michael and his Angels.</hi> So as here is an indissoluble and inseparable combination and confederacy of Prelates throughout the world, making up that one <hi>Militant</hi> or <hi>Malignant Church,</hi> whereof one must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>L. p. 182. <hi>Let Rome reduce it selfe to the observation of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Apostolicke, to which it held in Irenaeus his time, and I will say as he did, That it will be then necessary for every Church, and for the faithfull every where to agree with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. <hi>Let Rome reduce it selfe to the rule of the Scripture in all things, which the faithfull there held in Pauls time, when he was prisoner, yet Preacher in Rome, and then I will say (and wilbe the first that will doe it) I wilbe one of the faithfull, that will agree with it.</hi> But for <hi>Tradition Apostolicke,</hi> I know not what you meane, and therfore I dare not say as you doe. But still you hold with <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine primus,</hi> I am sure of it. You hold fast together for your Hierarchy, wherein you place the Pope your <hi>Ordine primus.</hi> Which while you doe, Whatsoever <hi>Tradition Apostolicke Rome</hi> shall reduce it selfe to, it wilbe most perillous and pernicious too for any of the <hi>faithfull</hi> to agree with it. And I am sure the Hierarchy, and our <hi>Ordine primus</hi> in that, was no <hi>Tradition Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicke.</hi> So for that, ther's no talke of reducing, either for <hi>Romes</hi> or <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And could you perswade the world to agree with with the <hi>Ordine primus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> then that speech of yours (<hi>pag.</hi> 182.) would easily take place in these our times, as well as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time. <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Very great reason was there in Irenaeus his time, that upon any difference arising in the Faith,</hi> Omnes undique fideles, <hi>all the faithfull, or, if you will, all the Churches round about, should have recourse, that is, resort to Rome, being the Imperiall City, and so a Church of more powerfull Principality, then any other at that time, in those parts of the world. But the meaning of A.C. is, we must so have recourse to Rome, as to submit our faith to hers. And should I grant them their own sense, that all the faithfull every where must agree with Rome (which I may give, but can never grant) yet were not this saying any whit prejudiciall to us now.

Why should not the thresholds of your Palace be as much worne with the footsteps of those that come to your Oracle for resolution in matters of <hi>faith:</hi> as the Shrine of your Predecessor S. <hi>Thomas of Canterbury,</hi> with the keyes of his blind <hi>votaries</hi>? And so much the more in these dayes; as wherein you have put all <hi>England</hi> to a stand and stagger what to <hi>beleeve</hi> in point of <hi>Faith,</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> like Meteors hang in suspense in the ayre, no man knowing what to make of them, whether they be <hi>white</hi> or <hi>blacke,</hi> or what such Comets portend, untill to that Edict of the Court (that binds up the sense of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles fast asleep, or in a slumber between Hawke and Buzzard, or as a speaking in a dreame) you shall superadde the Definitive Decree of the Chaire of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to interpret unto us what they have dreamed all this while.

            <p>L. p. 199. <hi>The Bishop of Rome hath no power from Christ, over the whole Church to be Iudge in Controversies: nay out of all doubt, 'tis not the least reason, why</hi> de facto <hi>he hath so little successe, because</hi> de Jure <hi>he hath no power given.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. <hi>Not over the whole Church.</hi> This seems to imply, that the <hi>Bishop of Rome hath a power from Christ to be Iudge in Controversies over all the Churches at least within his own more powerfull Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> And consequently, that the <hi>Primate of Canterbury</hi> hath the like power from <hi>Christ</hi> to be Judge in <hi>Controversies over the whole Church of England.</hi> If you have, yet it wilbe some ease to the English, that they have an Oracle so neare home to resolve them in all <hi>doubts,</hi> so as they need not (as formerly) go trudge to <hi>Rome</hi> for the matter. But neither to the <hi>Pope in his Powerfull Principality,</hi> nor to you in your <hi>Primacy</hi> hath <hi>Christ given any power at all</hi> to be Judge in <hi>Controversies of Faith.</hi> And because you have no <hi>Calling, nor Commission from Christ,</hi> therfore 'tis true you say in this, that the Pope hath no <hi>better successe.</hi> And I pray you <note n="‡" place="margin">

'Tis true, you have put many a good <hi>Minister</hi> to Silence, thrust many a one out of his Cure, and Countrey, levied your way for an universall Conformity to <hi>Rome,</hi> prevailed much in your Designes that way: but yet have you any great cause to boast of your successe, all things Considered?

               <hi>Ieremie</hi> (speaking of <hi>false Prophets) I sent them not, neither commanded them: therfore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the Lord.</hi> So, neither have you reason to <hi>thinke,</hi> that because you may do what you list in turning things <hi>upside down,</hi> in seting up your <hi>Altars,</hi> in <hi>suppressing Gods word,</hi> in <hi>oppressing Gods Ministers,</hi> in <hi>advancing your Arminian and Popish faction,</hi> and you hitherto prosper therein, while there is never a man left, that dare so much as mutter a word against these your practises, so <hi>great</hi> is your Power, and so <hi>terrible</hi> your Cruelty, and <hi>Ministers</hi> so Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, so as by this meanes your Cause and Course seems to prosper, while you can crush any that shall interpose himselfe, or lawfully in his place oppose your <hi>violent courses:</hi> therfore <hi>Christ</hi> hath given you this power thus to tyrannise, wherein you doe so prosper.

               <hi>Christ thought it fitter to governe it Aristocratically, by Divers, rather then by One Viceroy. And I beleeve that this is true. For all the time of the first</hi> 300. <hi>yeares, and somwhat bettter, it was governed Aristocratically, to wit, by the Bishops,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>P. Here you give us occasion further to launch into the Deep of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> that we may sound the <hi>bottome</hi> of it, and so discerne what ground it floats upon (<hi>mudde,</hi> or <hi>sand,</hi> or both) although we have in part discovered it before. Here you say, and you say you <hi>beleeve it too</hi> (it is an <hi>Article</hi> of your <hi>Creed</hi>) that <hi>Christ</hi> thought it fitter to govern the Church <hi>Aristocratically</hi> by <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi> rather then by <hi>one Viceroy.</hi> And you give the Reason, <hi>The Church being as large as the world.</hi> We will first take an Assay of your words, and then of your Reason. For to a vulgar Reader some of your words are somwhat obscure, and some also very finely couched, that every eye cannot at the first discerne the Mystery of them.</p>
            <p>And first, for <hi>Aristocratically: Aristotle,</hi> the famous <hi>Philosopher,</hi> and no meane statesman, in his <hi>Politicks</hi> layes down 3 kinds of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:5075:165"/>
Civil <hi>Government,</hi> taken in the better part: The first is <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchia,</hi> which is a <hi>government</hi> by <hi>One:</hi> the second is, <hi>Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, which is a Government of the Best Men:</hi> the third is <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratia, which is a Government Popular, or of the People.</hi> Opposite to these <hi>three,</hi> he sets <hi>three</hi> sorts of bad <hi>Government:</hi> the first is <hi>Tyranny,</hi> which is opposed to <hi>Monarchy; Tyranny ruling</hi> either <hi>without,</hi> or <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>good Laws established:</hi> but a <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy governing</hi> according to the <hi>established good Laws</hi> of the <hi>State, Kingdome,</hi> or <hi>Common-weale.</hi> The second is, <hi>Oligarchia,</hi> which signifies the <hi>Government of a few;</hi> and this standing in <hi>opposition</hi> to <hi>Aristocratia (the Government of the best men</hi>) it signifieth the <hi>Government of a few of the worst men.</hi> The third is, <hi>Anarchia,</hi> that is, <hi>no Government at all,</hi> when without Law, or Ruler, every one doth that, which seems good in his own eyes (as Jude 17 6. and 21.25.) and this is opposed to <hi>Democratia,</hi> a <hi>Government of the people by good Laws.</hi> These things thus plainly layd down, we shall the more clearly proceed in our Point.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I note here your word <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>; which every man knows doth signifie a <hi>Vice-King,</hi> or one <hi>Deputed</hi> by the <hi>King</hi> to governe a <hi>Kingdome</hi> in his personall absence, whereof there is usually but one in a Kingdome; as the <hi>Vice-Roy of the Kingdome of Naples</hi> under the <hi>King of Spaine;</hi> or the <hi>Lord Duputy of Ireland</hi> under the <hi>King</hi> thereof. But yet every one doth not perhaps understand, that among diverse <hi>Prelates,</hi> you make your selfe a <hi>Vice-roy.</hi> But looking more narrowly into your words, we shall find that sense easily resulting from them. For you say, <hi>That Christ thought it fitter to governe his Church by Diverse, then by One Vice-Roy:</hi> that is, <hi>by Diverse Vice-Roys, rather then by One.</hi> All comes to one reckoning. And besides you expresse the word <hi>Diverse,</hi> and the word <hi>One</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a Capitall, to note, that both have reference to <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi> So as it runs Currant both wayes, whether you say, <hi>By Diverse, rather then by One Vice-Roy:</hi> or, <hi>By Diverse Vice-Roys, rather then by One.</hi> Thus 'tis plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            <p>Lastly, a third word here is of some difficulty: that you say, <hi>Christ thought it fitter.</hi> Now I never took you to be one of <hi>Christs</hi> Privy Councel, so as to be made Privy to <hi>Christs thoughts,</hi> and that in these things, which he hath no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in his <hi>word.</hi> But this is familiar with you (as before) to tell us <hi>Gods thoughts.</hi> But shew us where <hi>Christ</hi> hath <hi>expressed</hi> any such <hi>thought</hi> of his in his <hi>expresse word,</hi> the <hi>Scripture.</hi> If you cannot (as you cannot) how presume you to say, <hi>Christ thought
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:5075:165"/>
so.</hi> Certainly <hi>my Lord Iesus Christ, that</hi>

Governe your <hi>Churches</hi> by <hi>substitutes?</hi> Why then may not the Pope Governe the whole by his Curates, as you doe all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by your Curates?

Now to your Generall Councels.</p>
            <p>L. p. 192. <hi>And surely what greater or surer Iudgement can we have, where sense of Scripture is doubted, then a Generall Councel, I do not see.</hi> And pag. 211. <hi>The making of Canons, which must bind all particular Christians, and Churches, cannot be concluded, and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, but there (to wit, in a Generall Councel.)</hi> P. 224. I said, <hi>The Determination of a Generall Councel erring, was to stand in force, and to have externall obedience yeelded to it, till evidence of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a Demonstration to the Contrary, made the errour appeare; and untill thereupon another Councel of equall Authority did reverse it.</hi> And pag. 226. <hi>Now suppose a Generall Councel actually erring in some point of Divine Truth, I hope it will not follow, that this Errour must be so grosse as that forthwith it must be known to private men. And doubtlesse, till they know it, obedience must be yeelded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay when they know (if the Errour be not manifestly against fundamentall verity, in which case a Generall Councel cannot easily erre) I would have A.

               <hi>Therfore it may seem very fit and necessary, for the peace of Christendome, that a Generall Councel thus erring, should stand in force, till evidence of Scripture, or a Demonstration make the errour to appeare, as that another Councel of equall Authority reverse it.</hi> And ibid. <hi>No way must lye open to private men to refuse obedience, till the Councel he heard and weighed.</hi> And p. 261. <hi>A Councel hath power to order, settle, and define Differences arisen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith.

And therfore in things not fundamentall, nor necessary, 'tis no matter if Councels erre in one, and another, and a third, the whole Church having power and meanes enough to see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no Councel erre in necessary things,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If it erre in things necessary, we can be Infallibly assured by the Scripture, the Creed, the</hi> 4. <hi>first Councels, and the whole Church, where it erres in one, and not in another.</hi> And pag. 360 <hi>For one Faith necessary to Salvation, a most infallible certainty we have already in the Scripture, the Creeds, and the</hi> 4. <hi>first Generall Councels, to which for things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and fundamentall in the Faith, we need no assistance from other Generall Councels.</hi> P. 378. <hi>I submit my Iudgement with all humility to the Scripture, interpreted by the Primitive Church, and upon new and necessary doubts, to the judgement of a lawfull and free General<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And, I absolutely make a lawfull and free Generall Councel Iudge of Controversies, by and according to the Scripture.</hi> And p. 386. <hi>I have expresly declared, that the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> interpreted by the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, and a lawfull and free Generall Councel, determining ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these, is judge of Controversies.</hi>

            <p>P. Thus in your Commending of <hi>Generall Councels,</hi> you are very large, that I may not say <hi>lavish</hi> too. And surely in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect especially you have great Reason: for your <hi>Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels</hi> must consist of Prelates onely: so as in exalting <hi>Generall Councels,</hi> you magnifie your Prelacie.

               </gap>amed altogether for the advancing and upholding of their Dignity. But let us now take a briefe view of your words, which we will collect and reduce to certain summary Heads. First, <hi>That Generall Councels are the supreme Iudge of the sense of Scripture, when and where 'tis doubted,</hi> p. 192. Secondly,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:5075:180"/>
               <hi>that the Canons and Decrees of Generall Councels bind all Christians of necessity,</hi> p. 211. Thirdly, <hi>yea though Generall Councels deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Errors, yet that requires at least externall obedience.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That Generall Councels erring in some points of Divine Truth, yet you hope it will not be so grosse, as to come to the common view: or if it doe, yet obedience must be yeelded,</hi> p. 226. onely <hi>except the Error be not manifestly against the fundamentall Verities.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>That a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councel hath no power from Christ to be Iudge in Controversies, but the Church prudently tooke it up from the Apostles example,</hi> Act. 15. Sixtly, <hi>That the Difinitions of Generall Councels bind, being according to the Rule the Scripture: yet that those may be reversed by an after-Councel.</hi> Seventhy, <hi>A Generall Councel in things clearely and truly determined, cannot erre, but in that is infallible.</hi> Eightly, <hi>That it is pride not to obey the Councels, Difinitions, yea unlawfull, and not standing with any Government.</hi> Ninthly, <hi>That Christ intended to leave an Infallible certainty in his Church, but not to satisfie conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or curious, or presumptuous spirits.</hi> Tenthly, <hi>That it is no matter if Generall Councels erre in one, two, three &amp;c. things not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, nor necessary.</hi> Eleventhly, <hi>That for necessary Faith to Salvation, we have an Infallible certainty in the Scriptures, Creeds, and</hi> 4. <hi>first Generall Councels, to which for things necessary we need not the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of any other Generall Councel.</hi> Twelfthly, <hi>That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture interpreted by the Primitive Church and Generall Councels, is the Iudge of Controversies, whereunto you professe to submit in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> Thus these 12 Conclusions be as the 12 Articles of your Faith.</p>
            <p>But now let's a little examine what Truth or Force there is in all these. I confesse some of them are somwhat coincident, and like Brookes fall one into another, but all have their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into your Generall Councel, as one maine Ocean. But we will take a say of each, as they run along.</p>
            <p>For the first, and so the rest, which have any generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with it, I deny, <hi>that a Generall Councel is a sufficient, and competent Iudge of Controversies in matters of Faith.</hi> My Reasons are these. First, <hi>Because Generall Councels consisting of Prelates, and more especially in these latter times, are so much the unabler to judge of the sense of Scripture, where 'tis deep, or doubtfull.</hi> As <hi>Nicolaus de Clemangus</hi> in his Tract <hi>De Concilus Generalibus,</hi> discourseth very largely and pregnantly of this very Circumstance, shewing, <hi>that Prelates are none of those, to whom God doth reveale the mysteries of his will in his Word, which are altogether spirituall,</hi> but <hi>Prelates are carnall, proud, ambitious, covetous, minding the things of the world.</hi>

               <hi>a'pellotriomenoi tes politeías tou Israèl</hi> (as the Apostle speakes) <hi>Aliens from the Common-wealth of Israel.</hi> Yea even those, that have good learning and judgement in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, which they had before they were Prelates, after they come once to be Prelates, they are so choked with the world, and so over-awed with the servile feare of man, that they dare doe nothing for the Truth, especially in a time wherein it is openly opposed and oppressed, but are willing to sleep in a whole skin, and to let Religion and Faith sinke, or swimme, so they may injoy their Lordships, and fill their Coffers. Againe, suppose a Generall Councel of Prelates were called (for the purpose) to judge and determine of the Controvesie about the Calling of Prelates, whether it be <hi>Iure divino,</hi> by Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or no (as it was in Question and agitation in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Trent</hi>) would not such a Councel trow you be Partiall in their own Cause, and Define with one voyce, <hi>That Prelates

Or is there any Question to be made, but that without any more adoe, they would Order, Determine, Define, and Conclude, that Prelates the <hi>Church Collective,</hi> have power to ordaine what Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies they please in the worship and service of <hi>God,</hi> which shall bind <hi>all mens Consciences,</hi> to the <hi>necessary obedience,</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation</hi> therof?

            </p>
            <p>And because you are so much for a <hi>Generall Councel,</hi> as <hi>Iudge in Controversies,</hi> What say you to the first Generall Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> wherein there were above 300 Prelates (as I remember) Had they not all consented to the making of a Decree for the establishing of a <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.</note> 
               <hi>Doctrine of Devils,</hi> to wit, <hi>forbidding Marriage to all Ecclesiasticall Persons,</hi> had not one man <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> and he an <hi>unmarried man</hi> too, stood up, and withstood such a Decree, shewing by many Reasons and Arguments from <hi>Scripture</hi> and otherwise, how wicked and cruel such a Decree were. So early began the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> to bud forth, and that in the most Ancients, and in the very Prime or first Generall Councel, wherein these Fathers, the Prelates were so piously zealous (though ignorantly) to lay the foundation of a generall Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticie from the Faith, in establishing such a <hi>Doctrine of Devils,</hi> as the Apostle calls it; of which suffciently before. Yet by your Doctrine, If that <hi>Generall Councel</hi> of so many Prelates had determined it, and ratified it by Decree, all <hi>Priests then were bound to obedience,</hi> untill another <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> equall to that, should reverse it; which should have been long enough, when every Age grew successively worse then other. And thus in the very first, and best Generall Councel (after the Apostles) a Doctrine of Devils should have been ratified, and therein an Apostacie from the Faith, and all men must have yeelded obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, at least <hi>externall</hi> (enough to keep all your Priests from
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:5075:181"/>
Marriage) and so all Prelates and Priests should so quickly have proved a Generation of Apostates from the Faith.</p>
            <p>Againe, if you have a Generall Councel, you must not (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Councel of Frier <hi>Franciscus à S. Clara) admit of any Puritans,</hi> or the <hi>precise Party of the Reformed Churches</hi> beyond the Seas, no not such as you call <hi>Puritan Bishops.</hi> For you see what one wise and honest man did in preventing so wicked a Decree of a whole Generall Councell of many Prelates. And assure your selfe, were there but a few sound <hi>Puritans</hi> admitted to your <hi>Generall Councel,</hi> and might have free liberty to speake, you would not be able to resist the evidence of Truth, which they should bring in, as <hi>Arelatensis</hi> told the Prelates in the Councel of <hi>Basil,</hi> concerning the poore inferiour Priests. But if you shall exclude the <hi>Puritans</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so all <hi>Reformed Non Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall Churches,</hi> out of your <hi>Prelaticall Councel Generall,</hi> how should it be a <hi>Generall Councel?</hi> But I cry you mercy, <hi>Puritan Reformed Churches are already by you doomed for no members of your Catholicke Church,</hi> whereof and wherein yours and <hi>Romes Church</hi> are one and the same, and therfore as Heathen, they ought to be shut out for Wranglers, as they were from the <hi>Councel of Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Reason against a <hi>Generall Councel,</hi> being <hi>Iudge in Controversies</hi> is, because all <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>Orthodox Divines,</hi> both <hi>Ancient and Moderne,</hi> both <hi>Forraigne and Domesticke</hi> in the <hi>Church of England</hi> formerly, with all the <hi>Orthodox Fathers</hi> in this point, have held, professed, and beleeved, <hi>That the holy Scripture is the sole sufficient Iudge in all Controversies of Faith.</hi> And for proofe hereof, What say you to <hi>Dr Whitakers Lectures</hi> against <hi>Bellarmine and Stapleton</hi> in this Point? Or how do or can you answere any of his Arguments drawn from cleare <hi>Scriptures, and Testimonies from the Ancient Fathers.</hi> But it seems you have not been acquainted with him, as not once mentioning him in all this. For that were besides your Purpose. But you will except against him, as a <hi>Puritan,</hi> which is a sufficient confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with one puffe of your mouth. And so you doe all honest, sound, learned, Religious, Orthodox Divines whatsoever, whom particularly to alledge here, would but make your stomacke rise, and so I passe on to the rest.</p>
            <p>Secondly and Thirdly, and againe, and againe, I deny, that the Decrees of <hi>Generall Councels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.3.</note> bind any true Christians Faith and Conscience, so much as to <hi>outward obedience</hi> to any one <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi>; as before. Yea though your <hi>Councel Decree according to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:5075:182"/>
the Scripture,</hi> yet <hi>jure proprio,</hi> and absolutely of its own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it binds not the Conscience. That's proper and peculiar to the <hi>Scripture</hi> alone immediatly, the onely <hi>binding Rule of Faith</hi> and <hi>Conscience.</hi> How much lesse doth a Councel bind in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>error</hi> in a point of Faith? This is such an <hi>abominable point of Divinity,</hi> as never any Arch-Prelate of <hi>Canterbury</hi> since the <hi>Reformation</hi> and (I presume) before, ever uttered. <hi>Divinity,</hi> say I, yea <hi>Divinity</hi> Diabolicall, and monstrous Impiety, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Tyranny, to be hissed out by all that beare but the bare name of Christians. And this Answereth also to the Fourth,<note place="margin">4.</note> which is as full of ridiculous absurdity, as of impious folly. <hi>You hope</hi> (forsooth) that a <hi>Councels errors will not be so great as all men shall discerne them.</hi> That may well be, when many thousands take no notice at all of any such <hi>Councel Decrees.</hi> And how many men have not the eyes to discern even the <hi>grossest errors</hi>? How many in the Church of <hi>England</hi> doe discerne the grossenes and danger of your seting up of your Altars in all the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> as namely, that <hi>it is a denying of Christ the onely Altar,</hi> And <hi>the bringing in of the Popish Priesthood, and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice?</hi> But what if you could in a <hi>Provinciall Councel of Canterbury</hi> make a Decree for seting up, and worshiping of Altars, as you doe, and that all men did see the grossnes of it? Would the sight of it exempt them from at least <hi>externall obedience,</hi> being once <hi>defined</hi> in that your Synod? And so of a <hi>Generall Councel,</hi> for <hi>universall obedience.</hi> No, the <hi>knowledge of the grossnes of the error will not serve their turnes, to excuse them from obedience.</hi> For you tell us, <hi>We must notwithstanding yeild obedience.</hi> If so, surely it were the safest way then for men to close their eyes, that they may not see at all, and so yeeld <hi>blind obedience</hi> to your <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> pinning their soules (as I said) to the <hi>Prelates Innocent white sleeve,</hi> to be <hi>led blindfold to hell,</hi> then seeing and knowing, to sin against their Conscience, in <hi>yeelding obedience.</hi> But how ever, seeing, or not seeing, hang, or be damned, the <hi>Decree of a Generall Councel,</hi> even in <hi>point of error in the Truth,</hi> yea though men know it to be against <hi>Gods word,</hi> must be <hi>universally obeyed, till evidence of Scripture or a Demonstration to the contrary made the error appeare, and untill thereupon another Generall Councel equall to that, did reverse it.</hi> Which may be long enough, before all these things concurre. What? Must the Decree of the seventh <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councel,</hi> the second of <hi>Nice,</hi> for <hi>the worship of Images bind all men to Obedience, till another Generall Councell equall to that, upon Demonstration to the contrary, shall reverse it?</hi> Or <hi>must the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:5075:182"/>
Decree of the Councel of Lateran under Pope Innocent</hi> 3. <hi>for Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, be beleeved and obeyed by all men, at least in externall obedience, to worship the Altar and Hoast till another Councell equall unto that shall reverse it?</hi> Or <hi>must the Decree of the Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Constance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the taking away of the Cup in the Sacrament from the People, bind all to obedience, till another Councel equall unto that shall reverse it?</hi> Or lastly, <hi>shall the Decrees of the Councel of Trent</hi> (which calls it selfe a <hi>Generall Councel) ratifying the worship of Images, Transubstantiation, and the taking away of the Cup, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing the Peoples nose of it, besides all those other damnable and damning errors against the cleare Truth and Faith of Christ, bind all to obedience till another Councell equall to that shall reverse it?</hi> Then certainly all Papists, by your sentence, <hi>are bound to be damned.</hi> Nay, are not <hi>you and your Church of England</hi> bound to obey all those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Former <hi>Generall Councels,</hi> as that of the second of <hi>Nice,</hi> for worship of Images, not yet reversed by a <hi>Generall Councel</hi> equall to that, though by a <hi>Councel</hi> at <hi>Frankford</hi> called by <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Magnus,</hi> Emperour of the West, that wicked Decree was condemned. But the Decrees of this Councel are smothered, and kept in hugger mugger, as being outfaced by such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing generallity of unblishing Images, and so have lost their place among the Records of the Councels. And besides, that Councel at <hi>Frankford</hi> was not for generallty equall to that of <hi>Nice</hi> under that wicked Empresse <hi>Irene.</hi> Which being so, and so, that Decree of <hi>Nice</hi> not yet reversed, why (say I) doe not you obserue your own Rule in obeying that Decree, in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping of Images? Or why at least (though you here write somthing against them to some small purpose, as <hi>coming neare to Idolatry</hi>) doe you not yeeld <hi>externall obedience,</hi> in doing <hi>corporall Reverence to those Images you have set up,</hi> onely reserving your internall worship, and keeping your Faith to your selfe? But to <hi>satisfie</hi> us for that, you have over or upon your Altar in your own Chappel at <hi>Lambeth</hi> sufficient Images and Crucifixes, which, when you doe honour and homage to your Altar, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ot but participate of it. And againe the Councel of <hi>Constance</hi> being a Generall Councel, and the Decree therof for the Cup being not yet reversed by another Councel equall to that: And seeing your Church of <hi>England</hi> is one and the same with the Catholick Church when it was represented in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel: why doe you not presse your Doctrine unto Practise in your Church of <hi>England,</hi> telling them that they are all bound to the obedience of that Decree of the Councel of <hi>Constance,</hi>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:5075:183"/>
for the taking away of the Cup in the Sacrament, at least they are bound to <hi>externall obedience,</hi> not to drinke of that Cup till another Councel equall to that, shall reverse that Decree, which hath not yet been; but on the contrary the Generall Councel of <hi>Basill</hi> since that hath ratified that Decree of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> notwithstanding all the Bohemians supplications and demonstrations to the contrary? But you will say, you have here in your Book made a demonstration both against wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images, and the taking away of the Cup. But this will not free you from <hi>externall obedience to the Decrees of the said Councels, till another Councel thereupon equall to those shall reverse them.</hi> Therefore by your own Doctrine you have put upon your selfe and Church a necessity of <hi>externall obedience</hi> to the said Decrees, from which because you cannot otherwise be exempted, how doth it concerne you, and your Church of <hi>England</hi> too (if indeed you desire to be freed from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of those Decrees) to use all meanes for the expediting, and speedy calling of a Generall Councel, to reverse the said Decrees? And so much the rather now, when you have made such Demonstrations against those said Decrees, as being against Truth, which therfore you cannot obey, without offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring manifest violence to your Conscience. And if your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of the Church of <hi>England</hi> shall aledge, that these Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Heresies, Idolatries, Sacriledges, have been cryed down by one unanimous voyce of all Protestants, and in particuler, by the established <hi>Doctrines of the Church of England,</hi> yet your Doctrine tells them still, that <hi>being never yet reversed by a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councel equall to those wherein they were Decreed; and seeing that the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas are no true Churches, for fault of Prelates; And the Doctrines of the Church of England are declared to be doubtfull: therfore your Doctrine stands in force still, that externall obedience at least must be yeelded of all. Otherwise, it cannot stand with any Government,</hi> as you tell us here. But how stands it with <hi>Faith,</hi> with <hi>Conscience,</hi> with <hi>Scripture,</hi> with the <hi>Apostle, that a man is bound knowingly to obey an Errour in the Faith</hi>? For the Apostle saith, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23.</note> 
               <hi>whatsoever is not of Faith is sinne,</hi> that is, <hi>whatsoever a man doth against his Conscience, is sinne. So as you hereby teach men directly to sinne against their Consciences, and all to uphold the Credit of your Prelaticall Government and Decrees.</hi> Thus the Church of <hi>England</hi> may see what an Oracle she hath got in the Chaire of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>

               <hi>Brethren,</hi> the <hi>beleevers,</hi> who were also <hi>members</hi> of that <hi>Assembly,</hi> and who with the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> are mentioned in the <hi>Epistle,</hi> as whose joynt <hi>Assent was to the Decree.</hi> Here was then a Compleat <hi>Pattern of a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,</hi> when the <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> the <hi>people</hi> are the joynt <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Councel.</hi> For otherwise, how is it a <hi>Generall Councel,</hi> if it consist of the <hi>Ministers</hi> alone? So as that's a true difinition of a <hi>Generall Conucel,</hi> which <hi>consists Generally of the Ministers and People together.</hi> But you have <hi>prudently</hi> left out of your <hi>Generall Councels,</hi> not onely the <hi>People of God,</hi> but also his <hi>true Ministers,</hi> the <hi>Presbyters</hi>; these you shut out, not onely from your <hi>Councel,</hi> but also from your Catholicke Church, as not <hi>members</hi> of it; as they are not indeed. So as your <hi>Generall Synod</hi> or <hi>Councel,</hi> may truly be called (how <hi>prudently soever you have taken it up</hi>) as that <hi>second Councel of Ephesus was,</hi> lustrikè<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>a stollen Councel.</hi> Thus though you <hi>Prelates</hi> would be thought to be the <hi>Apostles suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,</hi> and propose their example here, yet in nothing do you follow them, no not in that, which you say you have here <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently taken up from their example:</hi> But your <hi>prudence</hi> is no other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to make the <hi>Apostles states</hi> for your <hi>tyranny</hi> while you Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the office of being the <hi>sole Iudges in Controversies of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the Scriptures too,</hi> which not even the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves did ever take upon them, though they had the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> which you have not.</p>
            <p>To the Sixth, it is answered in the former. For <hi>Difinitions of your Generall Councels,</hi> though they be for the matter <hi>according to Scripture,</hi> yet doe they not bind, as the <hi>Councels Difinitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods word</hi> in and of it selfe onely bindeth, as is said before. Nor doe your <hi>Generall Councels</hi> bind, for the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>forme,</hi> which is ever <hi>false,</hi> seeing they are not such <hi>Councels,</hi> as the <hi>Scripture</hi> alloweth And againe, neither doe they <hi>bind,</hi> because they are alwayes <hi>fallible,</hi> because never <hi>Infallible</hi> (by your own confession) and they are often erronious, as you also confesse. And therfore as when false, they bind not, so neither when true, are men bound to beleeve them, as he that is accustomed to lye, is ever suspected, although he somtimes tell truth.</p>
            <p>For the Seventh, it is as ridiculous, as some of its fellows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For you say, <hi>That in things truly determined by the Councel, being

            <p>Now seeing, though you arrogate, but are not able to prove, that <hi>Christ hath left your Catholicke Church an Infallible certainty, which yet you confesse to be uncertaine:</hi> give us leave (though we touched this before) now againe upon a fresh occasion to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the <hi>Truth of Christ,</hi> that he not onely <hi>intended,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath left unto his true Church an <hi>infallible certainty of his Spirit, which by the rule of his word doth guide his Elect into all truth in all ages successively</hi> unto the end of the world.

               <hi>Christ, this Spirit of truth, is none of his.</hi> And <hi>he that hath it, is preserved from the seduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of false Prophets,</hi> which come in <hi>Christs</hi> Name, and shall deceive many, <hi>but not the Elect; for that's not possible.</hi> Every <hi>true beleever cannot, will not willingly erre in any point of faith, and truth necessary to Salvation.</hi> I say, not wittingly. For many of <hi>Gods</hi> deare Children doe that <hi>ignorantly,</hi> whereby <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>denyed,</hi> as in yeelding obedience to mans devices in <hi>Gods worship,</hi> and that through custome, wheras if they were rowsed, and put to it, and asked if they beleeved not that <hi>Christ</hi> is the onely King of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:5075:188"/>
his Church, and Lord over the Conscience; oh, they beleeve and acknowledge none other King. Aske them againe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they beleeve that any man may exercise this Authority over them; oh, they renounce all such lords. Aske them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, why they subject their Consciences, soules and bodies to the will and lust of man in <hi>will-worship,</hi> forbidden by the Apostle: ô, they answere, they never knew that before: and now that they know it, they repent of it, and from henceforth they renounce it, and resolve to loose rather <hi>life</hi> and all, then they will doe so any longer. Thus even a good Christian, through <hi>ignorance</hi> may for a time in a dangerous <hi>errour</hi>; but so soon as he is convinced of it, he will not for all the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it. So he that hath true <hi>saving faith</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> resting on <hi>Christs merits</hi> alone for his <hi>justification,</hi> he neither will nor can be brought to beleeve, that he must be <hi>justified</hi> by his <hi>works.</hi> For this is against the very nature of <hi>saving faith,</hi> which rests onely on <hi>Christ,</hi> renouncing all other respects. So that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that any true member of <hi>Christ,</hi> should by any errour be so seduced, as to be seperated from <hi>Christ,</hi> for he is <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the spirit of Grace, by the power of God through faith unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> So that, as the whole body of the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> so every particular member of this <hi>body,</hi> hath the certaine and infallible seale of the Spirit of Truth given him of <hi>Christ,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>promise, purpose,</hi> and <hi>intention,</hi> for all truth abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary to salvation, having both his <hi>Spirit and word to guide them into all truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, 'tis very true (being taken in a true sence) that <hi>Christ never intended to leave an infallible certainty in his Church, to satisfie either contentious, or curious, or presumptuous spirits.</hi> And if not <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous spirits,</hi> certainly not such <hi>spirits,</hi> as usurpe a <hi>Prelaticall and Lordly Authority,</hi> and to sit as <hi>visible Iudges of Scripture in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels</hi>

So as the <hi>presumptuous</hi> is properly yours. As for the <hi>contentious,</hi> and <hi>curious,</hi> these are they that <hi>contend for the truth</hi> against your undermining and oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, and are <hi>curious</hi>

            <p>To the Tenth, you <hi>make no matter of it, if Generall C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Truly, my Lord, if you had not a <hi>liberty to talk with your pen</hi> what you please, and a strong opinion also, that whatsoever you write or speake, must needs be of every body highly applauded, as if all you write were Oracles: you would never have suffered such foule blots to have dropped from your pen.

But the <hi>reconciliation and setling of the Divisions of Christendome will conclude all.</hi> But still the <hi>Scripture</hi> with you, is not alone <hi>sufficient for necessary faith to salvation,</hi> without the <hi>Creed, and</hi> (at least) <hi>the</hi> 4 <hi>first Generall Councels:</hi> Why, <hi>was the Scripture, before there were any either Creeds, or Councels?</hi> And was not the <hi>Scripture</hi> then alone sufficient for all things necessary to <hi>salvation</hi>? The <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Councels</hi> are not to be added to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as if without them it were not an absolute and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Rule. As for the <hi>Creeds,</hi> they were for the summe and substance of them extracted from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and must still be reduced to <hi>Scripture</hi> for their true sense and interpretation, as before. And for the <hi>Decrees of the</hi> 4 <hi>Generall Councels,</hi> we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of them, no further, then the <hi>Scripture</hi> warrants them. And therfore though</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, <hi>you humbly submit to the Scripture, as it is interpreted by the Primitive Church and Generall Councels,</hi> and not els: yet <hi>we submit our faith onely to the Scripture, as it is interpreted by it selfe, and by the spirit of Christ speaking and breathing in it, which by the Scripture interprets the Scripture unto us</hi>; as <hi>Augustine</hi> doth well observe in his Second Book <hi>de Doctrina Christiana.</hi> And herein you shew your <hi>faith not to be Divine,</hi> but <hi>humane,</hi> as which you submit not meerly to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but unto the <hi>Iudgment of men,</hi> as they shall <hi>interpret</hi> the same unto you. And so I leave you to your <hi>faith,</hi> wherein you declare your selfe to be quite from the true Catholicke Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> whose Faith is <hi>built upon the onely foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ being the Chiefe corner stone, without any depending upon humane testimony and Authority.</hi> And so here an end of your Generall Councels.</p>
            <p>But yet one thing remains unresolved on your part, for you have told us that <hi>Generall Councels may erre even in fundamentall truths:</hi> but whether at any time they doe <hi>actually so erre,</hi> you resolve us not. Nay in some places you make it so ambiguous, whether they can <hi>erre,</hi> or no, that we know not what to make of it, fish or flesh. For (<hi>pag.</hi> 223.) you propound the Question, saying, <hi>whether a Generall Councel may erre, or not, is a Question of great consequence in the Church of Christ. To say it cannot erre, leaves the Church not onely without remedy against an errour once determined,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:5075:189"/>
but also without sense that it may need a remedy, and so without care to seeke it, which is the mystery of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>at this day.</hi> To <hi>say it</hi>

Now this Question of so <hi>great consequence,</hi> and that <hi>in utramque partem,</hi> on both sides, <hi>pro &amp; con:</hi> you seem in your last words here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve and determine, as if to say it can <hi>erre,</hi> were an <hi>errour, into which some opposers of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>have fallen.</hi> Now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath had many opposes, many Protestant, Learned and Judicicious Divines of former times in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who have clearly proved, that Generall Councels can erre: as we have shewed before. Now then do you prove they erred in so saying? Or (which is all one) how do you prove, that a <hi>Generall Councel cannot erre?</hi> For if it be an <hi>errour,</hi> to hold they <hi>can erre;</hi> 'tis no <hi>errour</hi> in you, to hold they <hi>cannot erre.</hi> Thus I find you fast upon the hooks, get off, and quit your selfe as well as you can. But <hi>pag.</hi> 239 you <hi>distinguish</hi>; which in summe is, <hi>That all those Popish Authors alledged by Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine for Generall Councels not erring, either speake of the Church (including the Apostles) as all of them doe: and then all grant the voyce of the Church is Gods voyce, and infallible; Or also they are Generall, unlimited, and appliable to private Assemblies, as well as Generall Councels, which none grant to be infallible, but some madde Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asts. Or else they are limited, not simply into all truth, but all necessary to salvation. In which I shall easily grant a Generall Councel cannot erre, suffering it selfe to be led by this spirit of Truth in the Scripture, and not taking upon it to load both the Scripture and the spirit,</hi> Thus there. Now here I would aske the most perspications and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader, that reads these lines, and ponders them well'-what certain conclusions or resolutions he can picke, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce out of your words, either for <hi>Infallibility,</hi> or not. First: That all grant, <hi>The voyce of the Church is Gods voyce, divine and infallible,</hi> if you speake of the Church including the Apostels. Whence your conclusion should be this: <hi>That Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, being the Church representative, are infallible, their voyce is Gods voyce, divine and infallible,</hi> understanding the Church, whereof they are the Representative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to include the Apostels. Ergo <hi>by vertue of the Apostles understood to be included in the</hi> Church, <hi>wherof Gen. Councels are the Representative, their voyce is Gods voyce, divine
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:5075:190"/>
and infallible, and so can not erre in any age unto the end of the world,</hi> still understanding that in the name of the Church the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles are included; can any rationable man, or reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture make hereof any other conclusion? Secondly, In all <hi>truth necessary to salvation, you easily grant a Generall Councel cannot erre, suffering it selfe to be led by the spirit of Truth in the Scripture.</hi> This is just as <hi>Arminius</hi> said in answere to that place in <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>L. p. 213. Sect. 27. <hi>My Answere was, That the Councel of Trent was not onely not legall in the necessary conditions to be observed in a Generall Councel, but also that it was no Generall Councel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. Though this be true, you say, yet the <hi>Councel of Trent</hi> was so <hi>legall,</hi> according to <hi>Romes own Law,</hi> that it wanted no conditions observable, to make it in that behalfe, not onely a <hi>legall,</hi> but a <hi>Generall Councel</hi> too. And secondly, so Generall for the Romane Catholicke Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that all the Decrees thereof doe bind all Papists to a necessary obedience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto them, and that under Anathema. And your Rule is, <hi>That a Generall Councells Decrees and Canons bind all Christians: and a Provinciall Councels Decrees bind all of that Province.</hi> And therfore I hope you will grant, that the <hi>Papall Councel of Trent</hi> is of force to bind all Papists, who acknowledge and accept the Pope for their Head, or Primate. So as though it were not a <hi>Generall Councel</hi> in the largest sense, yet it was a <hi>Generall Councel for the Roman Catholicke Church,</hi> which (say they) is the <hi>onely Catholicke Church.</hi> And with which (say you) <hi>the Church of England is one and the same.</hi> Now this I doe here touch by the way, as whereof I shall have occasion to make some use anon, though perhaps your thus Arguing against the <hi>generallity</hi> of <hi>Trents Councels,</hi> is one of those Passages, which you think may be an ingredience of the salve of your Reputation.

            <p>Again, One thing I cannot well passe over, which seems to me very ridiculous, where you say, that <hi>by the judgement of godly and learned men,</hi> those former Ceremonies have continued in the practise of this Church. Now who knoweth not, that these Ceremonies have so continued even by the <hi>judgement</hi> of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane</hi> and <hi>ignorant men.</hi> And what needs then the <hi>judgement of godly and learned men</hi> for the matter, as to testifie this? Except you meane <hi>by the judgement of godly and learned men,</hi> that <hi>godly and learned men</hi> have had most cause to know it, by undergoing the severe <hi>judgement</hi> of Censure of <hi>suspension</hi> and <hi>silencing,</hi> and other vexations, onely for not conforming to the practise of your Old Ceremonies, as many doe now, for not conforming to your New. Or els you so shuffle these words in, and so packe them together, that when they meet with a Reader, that weighs your words more by the <hi>sound,</hi> then by the <hi>sense</hi> (or rather want of <hi>sense</hi>) he may run away with this apprehension, as if <hi>godly and learned men had in their judgement approved of those Ceremonies</hi>; whereas few <hi>godly and learned,</hi> but rather wished them all long agoe at <hi>Rome</hi> again, from whence they came.</p>
            <p>But to come to your Conclusion out of <hi>Rhenanus,</hi> which by puting it down with approbation, you make to be your own: <hi>Doubtlesse Ceremonies doe not hurt the people, but profit them. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse?</hi> How prove you that? Nay <hi>doubtlesse,</hi> we have already proved, that both they doe <hi>hurt,</hi> and <hi>no way profit</hi> the <hi>people</hi>; they are good for <hi>nothing,</hi> for <hi>no body,</hi> unlesse for you <hi>Prelates,</hi> to uphold and exercise your Tyranny over <hi>Gods people,</hi> and to bring Fees into your Courts. And <hi>Beatus Rhenanus spake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Time, and Place,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> he lived in; although he was a moderate man, and saw more, then he durst speake of. And the same <hi>Rhenanus</hi> (as was before touched) in his Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rtullian,</hi> and I take it in that Book, out which you cite this sentence (<hi>De Corona Militis</hi>) observes, how sundry Heathen Ceremonies crope into the Church, by occasion of many old men newly converted to Christianity, whom it was hard to waine from their old Heathenish fashions, which therfore were thought fit to be admitted, as not hurting, but profiting those old Heathen new Christians. But <hi>godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men</hi> (as I said before) could tell you what infinite dammage
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:5075:198"/>
your tyrannicall pressing of your Ceremonies upon mens <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> hath brought to the Gospell, and so to the soules of men, by depriving them of so many worthy <hi>Ministers,</hi> onely for <hi>Non-conformity.</hi> But this is one speciall end, for which you so presse your <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> to <hi>suppresse Godly and learned</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and so the <hi>sincere Preaching of the word of God,</hi> that the <hi>people</hi> being brought up in <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>profanesse,</hi> might be the lesse sensible of bearing the yoake of your Antichristian Tyranny over them. But as for your Carnall <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith are good for nothing, <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>But <hi>Rhenanus</hi> addes a qualification: <hi>so there be a meane kept.</hi> I think you might have done well to have omitted this, till you had been better acquainted with this <hi>meane;</hi> of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And the Author might have expressed this <hi>Meane a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more fully,</hi> thus: <hi>So there be either no Ceremonies at all, or if any, those very few, and those few not pressed, with rigor, or necessity upon mens Consciences, but left free to every one to use them, or not, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Christian liberty, which Christ hath purchased for them,</hi> as is said before. Whereas you are not satisfied with a <hi>few Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> nor with the Old, but you must have New added, with a <hi>Tot quot,</hi> and all of them you presse so hard upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as you wring blood. And this is all the <hi>Meane</hi> you keep.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>So the By be not put for the Maine: that is</hi> (say you) <hi>so we place not the principall part of our Piety in them.</hi> And doe not you so? For you put your <hi>Altar,</hi> and all the solemn <hi>Service,</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> of <hi>Devotions</hi> and <hi>Adorations</hi> attending upon it, even all your <hi>humane Inuentions</hi> and <hi>Will worship,</hi> for the very <hi>Maine</hi> of all your <hi>Religion.</hi> Do you not? I know you willingly confesse it. And what's the <hi>By,</hi> but <hi>Gods-word, and the sincere Preaching thereof,</hi> which you put <hi>By,</hi> and by seting up your <hi>Altar-service,</hi> do thrust out of the Church by the head and shoulders, as is noted before? And I say, The <hi>Maine,</hi> the <hi>All</hi> and <hi>some</hi> of all your <hi>Religion,</hi> is your <hi>Altar:</hi> On this your <hi>Goddesse,</hi> all your <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Devotions</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as so many Hand-mayds give their devout attendance. Your <hi>face prayeth towards</hi> your <hi>Altar:</hi> your <hi>body boweth towards</hi> your <hi>Altar:</hi> your second solemn <hi>service</hi> (as the <hi>secundae Mensae</hi>) for your daintier Cates, must be served up upon your <hi>Altar,</hi> which the <hi>maine Body</hi> of the Church must not tast of: your <hi>Third service</hi> (which is instead of the Preachers

That's the <hi>Maine</hi> But What's the <hi>By</hi> then? Namely all the <hi>Intralls</hi> or <hi>Inwards</hi> of <hi>externall Devotion</hi> and <hi>worship,</hi> these are the <hi>appurti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> these are the <hi>By.</hi> What are those <hi>Inwards?</hi> The <hi>Inwards</hi> of <hi>True Externall worship, are Faith, Feare of God, Love of God, Zeale of Gods Glory, sincerity of heart in spirit and Truth.</hi> Now these with you are altogether the <hi>By</hi>; for these you have layd quite <hi>By,</hi> as before.</p>
            <p>L. p. 280. F. (Fisher reports) <hi>After this, we all rising, the Lady asked the Bishop whether she might be saved in the Romain Faith? He answered she might.</hi> L. <hi>What? Not one Answere perfectly related? My Answere to this was Generall, for the ignorant, that could not discerne the errours of that Church, so they held the foundation, and conformed themselves to a Religious life.</hi> Pag. 285. <hi>We have not so learned Christ, as to deny salvation to some ignorant silly soules, whose humble peaceable obedience makes them safe among any part of men, that professe the foundation Christ.

            <p>P. From all these words together, we observe this one <hi>Maine, That silly ignorant Papists, living and dying in the Romish Faith, may be saved; with these conditions:</hi> 1. <hi>If they discerne not the errour of that Church:</hi> 2. <hi>So they profes the foundation Christ:</hi> 3. <hi>So they conforme to a Religious life, in an humble and peaceable obedience.</hi> The second <hi>Maine</hi> I observe is, <hi>That we ought not to deny to such in that case salvation</hi> And that upon these Reasons, 1. <hi>Because we have not so learned Christ.</hi> 2. <hi>Because it is stiffnesse and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse in Protestants, to deny all Papists salvation.</hi> 3. <hi>That in granting them salvation, it is true Charity not mistaken.</hi> 4. <hi>That if Charity herein be mistaken, 'tis better then none at all.</hi> Of all these brefly.</p>

               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:5075:199"/>First then I Answere: <hi>That the Roman Faith</hi> being <hi>Infidelity</hi> it selfe, 'tis impossible, that any living and dying in that <hi>faith,</hi> can be <hi>saved.</hi> And we have before proved it to be <hi>flat Infidelity,</hi> and <hi>Apostacy.</hi> Nor will it excuse any <hi>Ignorant,</hi> that he discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not this <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and <hi>Apostacy.</hi> For <hi>ignorance,</hi> though it excuse <hi>à Tanto</hi> (as the Schoolmen speake) from the <hi>muchness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>They that observe lying vanities, forsake their own mercy.</hi> But, Thirdly, you say, <hi>They may be saved, so they conforme to a Religious life.</hi> Now what is <hi>the Religious life of a Papist,</hi> and especially of a <hi>silly ignorant Papist</hi>? Namely, <hi>to goe to Shrief,</hi> or <hi>Confession to the Priest,</hi> his <hi>Ghostly Father,</hi> as often as may be (as the <hi>Fernall Glory,</hi> published by your Chapleins licence, teacheth) or <hi>at the least once a yeare against Easter: to keep his Lent-fast strictly,</hi> so as upon <hi>paine of damnation, or greivous penance, not to eat an egge all that time, and so observe all othor Fasting-dayes in the yeare, together with all Holydayes: to say over their Beads every day in repeating their</hi> Pater Noster, Ave Mary, <hi>Creed, and ten Commandements, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f either they be so learned, or devout: to goe to their dayly Masse and Mattens, where it is their safety to understand never a word, nor to say Amen to the Priest, but by the sound of his voyce:</hi> which they understand no more, then the chattering of a <hi>Magpy: to call upon such a Saint, his speciall Mediator,</hi> and <hi>say a</hi> Pater Noster, <hi>and</hi> Ave Mary <hi>before such an Image, and especially of their Lady:</hi> and a thousand such like observations, wherein a <hi>Popish Religious life consisteth.</hi> And
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:5075:200"/>
so this is the Religious life of your <hi>ignorant silly Papist,</hi> wherin <hi>living and dying, he may be saved, if he may beleeve your Doctrine.</hi> But to this you adde, <hi>An humble and peaceable obedience.</hi> To What? Or to whom? As to the Priests Ghostly Discipline, when he injoynes <hi>sore penance,</hi> as <hi>whipping-cheare in Lent,</hi> or the like. Or if you meane <hi>peaceable obedience</hi> to the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, as in <hi>England:</hi> that must be according to their Ghostly Fathers <hi>direction</hi> and <hi>limitation:</hi> they must not take the Oath of Supremacy, nor in some cases, the Oath of Allegiance, when it makes for the Catholick Cause. And though to satisfie the Law, and save his purse, he come <hi>once a moneth</hi> to Church, and heare your <hi>service:</hi> yet Sermon he must not heare, especially if the Preacher be Puritannicall, for that might turn him quite from his Popery. And thus such, partly by their <hi>peaceable civill life,</hi> and partly by their <hi>humble Popish Religious life,</hi> so living and dying may be <hi>saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therfore to such <hi>silly Ignorants,</hi> we must not deny <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Why so? For first, <hi>We have not so learned Christ,</hi> say you. <hi>Wee</hi>? What <hi>wee?

            <p>P, And of this of <hi>Ridley</hi> you say (<hi>ibid.) 'Tis well if some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants except not against it.</hi> For this difference <hi>de Modo, of the manner of the Presence of Christs naturall Body in the Sacrament,</hi> we have spoken before at large. And was this Difference, trow you so small that cost both <hi>Ridley,</hi> and <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and <hi>Frith</hi> their lives? For you cite them all 3 in one Page, calling them the learned of those <hi>zealous</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes. Martyrs you do not call them: beware of that. So as <hi>times kàrin</hi> for honour sake you mention them not. So you cite <hi>Calvin</hi> a little before, whom in the High Commission you honoured with the Title of Rascall. And these Martyrs are they, whom one of your Divines of note and worth (Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>) in a Booke licensed by your Chaplein stiles with the Honourable Title of Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Hereticks. But to let this passe for currant with you: The summe of your whole passage touching this point, from <hi>pag.</hi> 292. to 296. is to perswade us to acknowledge a reall <hi>presence</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> naturall body in the Sacrament, onely differing from the <hi>Papists quoad moaum,</hi> as touching the manner of <hi>presence.</hi> Now I confesse this is a very pretty and ready way to lead to your <hi>Reconciliation.</hi> But let me tell you, even <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>names,</hi> and verball expressions are of no small force many times, to
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:5075:202"/>
lead men into great <hi>errours,</hi> although at first they meant no harme, that used them. For instance. The Primitive Fathers, when they began to call the <hi>Lords Table</hi> an <hi>Altar:</hi> they little dreamed what an <hi>Altar</hi> it would prove afterwards, as wheron to offer up in <hi>sacrifice Christs naturall body</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So when they called <hi>Ministers Priests,</hi> they imagined not, that those <hi>Priests</hi> would prove afterwards such sacrificing <hi>Priests,</hi> as now are in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And when they called the <hi>Lords supper</hi> a <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> which they meant to be <hi>Eucharisticall,</hi> of <hi>thanksgiving,</hi> they never suspected, that this would become afterwards a <hi>corporall sacrifice of Christs very body and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ood.</hi> And yet these very Names so taken up, gave occasion afterwards of setting up the greatest Idol that ever was in the world, as we see at this day. So dangerous is it to expresse Divine matters by any other Name, then what the Scripture hath given them. Seeing then that in Scripture we find no such words as <hi>Reall Presence of Christs naturall body in the Sacrament:</hi> it is not safe for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to take them up. And so much the more, because we see by experience the mischiefes, that this <hi>reall presence</hi> (so called and so understood, as the Papists doe) hath done in the Church of <hi>God.</hi> How many Martyrs hath it made? How much inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood hath it spilt? So as it hath gotten (and that deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly) a very bad Name. And it is the Name, or Word, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Romanists expresse their Great Idol in the Masse. And <hi>David</hi> saith, <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Their Drinke offerings of Blood will I not offer, nor take up their Names into my lips.</hi> So as Christians ought not to use the <hi>Names of Idols,</hi> invented by man, to expresse Divine things of <hi>Scripture</hi> by.

               <hi>Idolatry,</hi> he brake it to pieces. And so in this case, though these words <hi>The Reall Presence,</hi> may beare a good sense: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that of long time abused to the setting up and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of most grosse Idolatry: we are to stamp it to powder, and never use it more. And we have as little reason to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hereto by your Lordship as by any. For as this word, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presence,</hi> is very suspicious, in it selfe, and much more in regard of the Papists abusing of it: so it wants not suspicion, that you so commend it unto us. First, in regard of the whole matter of your Book, which generally complyes with Popery: Secondly, in regard of the main scope of your Booke, which is
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:5075:203"/>
to bring on a Reconciliation with <hi>Rome.</hi> And Thirdly, and more especially, in regard of some speeches, which have now and then dropped from you in publick Court, where speaking of <hi>Altars</hi>-placing, you said, you would have none to sit above <hi>God-Allmighty;</hi> which must needs imply (as before is noted) that either your <hi>Altar</hi> is your <hi>God Allmighty</hi>; or els <hi>God Allmighty</hi> hath a locall presence and residence there upon your <hi>Altar.</hi> And so Fourthly, your eager <hi>zeale,</hi> in promoting of <hi>Altars,</hi> makes us much to suspect your <hi>Reall Presence,</hi> as fearing all will not be well, when once we have taken up, and let down this <hi>Reall presence</hi> of <hi>God Allmighty</hi> into our bellies. And so also, Fiftly, your <hi>Priests</hi> (by that Name) doe increase the suspition. And Sixtly, because you tell us before of a <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> taken properly, and improperly. And Seventhly, Because you tell us by and by, that <hi>Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Forbearance of the Cup, are but Disputed and Improbable Opinions.</hi> Lastly, it is used to <hi>Idolatry:</hi> and so to be broken in pieces, as the Brazen Serpent was. And therfore for all these Reasons, we desire not to be troubled with your <hi>Reall presence,</hi> but leave it to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, or to you, to restore it where you had it, or if you like it so well to use it, let it be to your selfe, or Chappell at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> trouble not the Church of <hi>England</hi> with it any more, which desireth not more matter for a new Booke of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the Martyrs. First for <hi>Ioh. Friths</hi> words, <hi>Not to make it an Article of Faith, but leave it Indifferent.</hi> First, However the words sound, we must weigh them by the sense. And the best Commentary of his words, is his <hi>death,</hi> which he suffered even therfore, because he made it an <hi>Article</hi> of his <hi>faith</hi> to <hi>beleeve,</hi> that <hi>Christ was not Really Present in the Sacrament,</hi> as the <hi>Papists</hi> do hold; and therfore on the contrary, he held it as an <hi>Article</hi> of his <hi>faith, That Christ was onely vertually and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually present to the Faith of the Receiver,</hi> according to the true meaning of those Sacramentall words, <hi>This is my body</hi>; as a little before we shewed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to take <hi>Friths</hi> words in your sense, doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a Christians <hi>faith,</hi> as touching the Sacrament, wherein the <hi>beleever</hi> receives and applyes by <hi>faith</hi> the <hi>merits</hi> of <hi>Christs death</hi> to the comforting, nourishing, and strengthning of his <hi>soule.</hi> And a man is bound to <hi>beleeve</hi> aright concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and to put a maine difference between <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now for Dr <hi>Ridley,</hi> saying <hi>we differed</hi> in Modo, <hi>in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> 'Tis true. And the <hi>manner</hi> is the whole <hi>matter of difference.</hi> Papists say, <hi>Christs naturall Body is present:</hi> we <hi>that the merit and vertue of his Body broken upon the Crosse, and the merit and vertue of his Blood, shed upon the Crosse, is present to the beleeving soule in the Sacrament.</hi> I may expresse it by this similitude, of the Sun, and the beames. The body of the Sun is in heaven, in its spheare locally, and circumscriptively, but the Beames are on the earth. And when the Sun beames shine into our house, we say, here's the Sun, though it be the beames, not the body of the Sun. And so the Scripture saith of the Sacrament, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> because with the <hi>bread</hi> the <hi>faithfull Communicant</hi> receives the beames of <hi>Christs</hi> Body crucified into his soule, his merits, but not the Body it selfe. But the Papists say as much, as, <hi>The very body of the Sun is in their house, when it shineth.</hi> But enough of this here, having spoken sufficiently of it before. Yet for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: If <hi>your Lordship hold it to be a matter so indifferent,</hi> about the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Christs naturall-bodyes presence</hi> in the Sacrament, which you put upon the Martyrs, if you were put to it as they were; would you be of their mind, and resolution, rather to loose <hi>Canterbury,</hi> life and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, then beleeve as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> beleeves of the <hi>reall presence.</hi> But I leave you to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</p>
            <p>L. p. 297. <hi>Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Forbearance of the Cup in the Sacrament, are disputed and improbable Opinions: yet so impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as this may be enough for us to leave Rome, though the Old Prophet forsooke not Israel.</hi> 3 Reg. 13. (And a little after) <hi>And therfore in this present case, ther's perill, and great perill of damnable both Schisme and Heresie, and other sin, by living and dying in the Roman faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with so many superstitions, as at this day it is, and their Tyranny to boot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:5075:204"/>P. I told you, I feared some such thing, when you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended last unto us the indifferencie of admitting of Termes of <hi>Reall Presence.</hi> For now I perceive your <hi>Reall presence</hi> even in <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> it selfe, is but an <hi>improbable</hi> and <hi>disputed opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as also <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and the <hi>Forbearance of the Cup.</hi> And by <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,</hi> I suppose you meane <hi>Disputable,</hi> such as either hath been <hi>disputed,</hi> or may be <hi>disputed</hi> againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so as these things are matters of <hi>dispute,</hi> and <hi>improbable.</hi> And somtimes a thing that is <hi>improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> may prove <hi>true.</hi> For <hi>Improbabile</hi> is not alwayes <hi>falsum.</hi> It may seem <hi>improbable</hi> to us, and yet be <hi>true</hi> in it selfe. But for <hi>Transubstantiation:</hi> is that which is clearly against <hi>Faith,</hi> against <hi>Reason,</hi> against <hi>the nature of Christs Body naturall,</hi> against the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacrament,</hi> but an <hi>improbable opinion?</hi> And for <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: Is that which is against Faith, and overthrows the infinit vertue, merit, and efficacie of the blood of Christ, but an improbable opinion?</hi> And is that, which you confesse to be against the expresse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> (as the taking away of the Cup in the Sacrament) but an <hi>improbable opinion</hi>? And doe you so favourably call that, but a <hi>Forbearance,</hi> which is a most <hi>notorious</hi> and <hi>shamelesse Sacriledge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then secondly, <hi>All this</hi> (say you) <hi>may be enough for us to leave Rome. May be: Much may be:</hi> but <hi>Is not,</hi> I hope. And so long, well enough. And though <hi>Actu</hi> it be, yet not <hi>affectu.</hi> But you might have said, <hi>All this,</hi> and much more besides, if not onely <hi>disputable</hi> and <hi>improbable</hi> things, but <hi>abominable and damnable.</hi> But this is enough, were there no more. Yet (say you) <hi>the old Prophet forsook not Israel.</hi> What then? <hi>Ergo</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, though they might have had cause enough to leave Rome, yet should have done rather as the old Prophet did, not to have made a separation from Rome.</hi> Ergo <hi>they were not so kind, as the old Prophet.</hi> But the <hi>old Prophet</hi> might continue in <hi>Israel</hi> upon better terms, then the <hi>Protestants</hi> could have done in <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>Israel</hi> had no <hi>Inquisition,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> hath. And you confesse that men might live in <hi>Israel,</hi> and injoy the liberty of their Conscience, seeing there was no Law made to <hi>restrain</hi> them from going to the one <hi>Altar</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or to constrain them to <hi>sacrifice</hi> in the <hi>high places.</hi> And yet that's more, then I beleeve can well be proved. For those 7000. <hi>that had not bowed to Baal</hi> did hide themselves, as not daring to professe and avow their Religion and Faith towards <hi>God,</hi> as before. So as it seems there was no open to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration in <hi>Israel</hi> for any to goe up to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And it can hardly be thought, that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> being a great Politician,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:5075:204"/>
should give toleration to his subjects to goe up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to worship, least they should fall back to <hi>Iuda</hi> againe, for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof the two Calves were set up, to keep the people at home. The like policie used the High Priests, Scribes and Pharisees to suppresse those that should <hi>confesse Christ,</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Decree to <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.22.34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> excommunicate them, and so in <hi>puting Christ to death,</hi> least his <hi>Kingdome</hi> should put down theirs. And I hope your Hierarchy wants not the like policie, for the rooting out of <hi>Puritans,</hi> the true <hi>Professors and People of Christs Kingdome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Christs Kingdome</hi> and yours cannot <hi>consist together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you conclude, somwhat dangerously, when you say, <hi>Therfore in the present case ther's perill, great perill of damnable both Schisme, and Heresie, and other sins, by living and dying in the Roman faith, tainted with so many superstitions, as at this day it is, and their Tyranny to boot.</hi> This conclusion you apply, not to the <hi>silly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Papists</hi> (for you leave them secure, and out of danger, as afore) but to the <hi>knowing men</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> having shewed them, that though the silly <hi>ignorants</hi> may perhaps through the thick fogge and Aegyptian Myst of their palpable <hi>ignorance</hi> steale, or stumble into <hi>heaven:</hi> yet for the <hi>learned,</hi> as <hi>A.C.</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, 'tis danger, yea great danger to live and dye (and that knowingly) in the <hi>Roman faith.</hi> But me thinks neither here do you buckle your selfe to such a serious businesse as this is, so as to pull these wilfull men out of their puddle, wherein they wittingly stick so fast.

            <p>But I may not leap over that, which you have stumbled upon, namely, <hi>Romes Tyranny to boot.</hi> And it were well, if such <hi>Tyranny</hi> were confined to <hi>Rome</hi>; saving that all <hi>Tyranny</hi> is such, as it will not be <hi>confined</hi> to any place, within any bounds. You say, that the <hi>Church of England, and that of Rome, are one and the same Church.</hi> Certainly then, this One Church (what ever you pretend of the Catholick Church) is of such a <hi>constitution,</hi> as

            <p>L. p. 299. <hi>I do indeed for my part (leaving other men free to their own judgement) acknowledge a possibility of salvation in the Roman Church.

            </p>
            <p>P. Now you speake a little more plaine, then before. But how do you <hi>leave other men free to their own judgement,</hi> when for not being of your <hi>judgement</hi> in this point, you cens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

distinguish, <hi>That, as Romanists, they cannot be saved, but as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, beleeving the Creed, and holding the foundation Christ.</hi> But we told you before, that your <hi>silly ignorant Papists</hi> do not so much as understand or know the very letter of the Creed, how much lesse beleeve it?

            <p>P.

most of the <hi>grossest points of Popery,</hi> as <hi>worship of Images</hi> at least with <hi>Doulia,</hi> and the like, and assaying to prove the <hi>Pope not to be Antichrist,</hi> as if he would <hi>solem è coelo tollere:</hi> also Dr. <hi>Whites Book of the Sabbath,</hi> to prove no <hi>Sabbath to Christians,</hi> and the <hi>fourth Commandement not to be Morall, for the keeping of one day in the weeke, as the Lords Day:</hi> allowing <hi>also of vaine sports, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane pastimes on that Day:</hi> and <hi>commending of praying towards the East, where your Altar is placed,</hi> and such like stuffe: in all which he so <hi>well deserved of your Church of England,</hi> as he scarce had his fellow; onely if he were now living againe, he would yeeld the Bucklers to your Lordship as the bravest Champion of the now Chuch of <hi>England</hi> that hath risen up in this latter Age, or yet succeeding times may hope to produce.</p>

               <hi>Let them alone, They are blind leaders of the blind: and if the blind lead the blind, they both fall into the ditch.</hi> So you may see here (if ye be not blind) that <hi>blindnesse</hi> is damnable. But you will say, <hi>This was obstinate blindnesse, fighting against the light,</hi> 'Tis true, that the blindnesse of the Pharisees was obstinate, against the cleare <hi>light,</hi> and their own Consciences: but the blind people whom they led, were simply blind, out of meere <hi>ignorance,</hi> and so not against their Conscience: and yet both the leader and the led, fall into the ditch of <hi>damnation</hi> He that drinks deadly poyson <hi>ignorantly</hi> perisheth, as he that <hi>wittingly</hi> drinks it. The poyson is in it selfe <hi>mortall</hi> to all that drinke it, with what mind soever they doe it. And such is the poyson of sin and errour. Onely he that erres of <hi>ignorance,</hi> is more easily recovered, then one that is <hi>obstinate</hi> in his errour: and both, living and dying in the same errour, as of <hi>infidelity,</hi> and the like (which all Popery is) both are tormented in <hi>hell,</hi> but the <hi>obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> more then the other: yet <hi>God</hi> is <hi>just</hi> in punishing both.

And it is of the same <hi>righteous judgement</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to deny to the <hi>ignorant</hi> means, and to others the right use of the means, by withholding his <hi>grace:</hi> and accordingly he is <hi>just</hi> in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all with a due proportion. And so ther's a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween simple Papists living in the midst of the Aegyptian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, where there is no light, nor meanes of knowledge, and simple Papists living in <hi>Goshen,</hi> where the light shineth where the Gospell is preached, and doe close their eyes wilfully, so as they obstinately refuse to see or heare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The sin of these cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is much more damnable, then of the other, who have no meanes at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Againe, Errours that are in their own nature damnable, are damnable in whomsoever they be, onely in some more, in some lesse, but we cannot say, they are to some damnable, and to others not damnable.

Now doth the Law injoyne that, which in it selfe is <hi>unlawfull</hi> for a <hi>man to doe,</hi> that is <hi>otherwise resolved in Conscience?</hi> Nor is this Law repeald, though (as before) it be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the Law prescribes to be observed in your Church. <hi>Now a poore soule is not in Conscience perswaded, that he ought to conforme to such Ceremonies of necessity imposed,</hi> as being <hi>ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sole King over his Church, ruling in the <hi>Conscience of his People.</hi> Well you say, <hi>in this case</hi> such a man <hi>is bound against his Conscience to observe such Ceremonies?</hi> And if he be not bound, why doe you so severely and terribly punish him, for not daring to doe that, <hi>which is against his Conscience?</hi> Wheras the Papist, otherwise resolved <hi>in Conscience,</hi> you hold not bound to come to your English Church. And so of your Protestant, for going to the Romish Church, being against his <hi>Conscience.</hi> Will you not allow to the <hi>Conscience</hi> of the first as good Law, as you doe to the two last? Againe, you allow a greater and larger <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> to your <hi>Protestant</hi> to go to the Romish Church, then the Jesuite doth to his Romanist, to come to your English Church. For he allows not his Romanist to come to your English Church, <hi>that is resolved in Conscience of the truth of the Roman Church, that it is a true Church, and that the truth is there:</hi> whereas you doe not allow your Protestant to goe to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church, that is onely <hi>resolved in Conscience, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the truth is in the Church of England</hi> Now there is great difference between <hi>the truth,</hi> and the profession of the <hi>truth.</hi> So as he that is resoled in <hi>Conscience,</hi> that <hi>the truth is onely profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Church of England,</hi> and is not withall resolved, that the <hi>truth it selfe is in the Church of England,</hi> may with more <hi>liberty</hi> goe to the Romish Church, then the Romanist may come to yours, that is <hi>resolved of the truth of and in the Romish Church.</hi> So as herein also the Jesuite hath the advantage of you. Againe, if the Jesuite did meane, by the <hi>truth</hi> of the Roman Church <hi>the profession of the truth in that Church,</hi> he therein comes no whit behind you. For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as well makes a false <hi>profession</hi> of the <hi>truth,</hi> as your Prelaticall Church of <hi>England</hi> doth. Againe, you make it no great matter of difference in this case between your <hi>Protestant</hi> and the Romanist, whither this or that goe to each others Church, so his <hi>Conscience put not a barre.</hi> As you tell us a little after, <hi>That the Church of Rome, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, do not set up a different Religion</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of which in its place.

But now, what if one of your <hi>simple Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, be not resolved in Conscience of the profession of the truth in the Church of England, more then of that in the Church of Rome?</hi> Is

            </p>
            <p>P. By <hi>Protestants</hi> here, 'tis plain enough you mean those <hi>of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:5075:223"/>
the Church of England,</hi> not those of the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas, I am sure of it. For they utterly renounce the Romish Religion and Faith <hi>as Antichristian,</hi> which you avow for <hi>Christian, the same with yours.</hi> But they differ (say you) in the <hi>same Religion.</hi> How? They do not set up a <hi>different Religion,</hi> and yet they differ in the same Religion? I understand not this Babylonish language. But wherein then doe they differ in the same, and undiffering Religion? In <hi>some certaine grosse corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> say you. But in <hi>some,</hi> not in <hi>all grosse corruptions,</hi> which are indifferent, and common to you both. And what <hi>grosse corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are common to both, those shall not be put in the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>corruptions</hi> at all, each covering other with the mantle of <hi>Charity.</hi> Yea such as you both agree in, are the very <hi>substance</hi> of your <hi>Religion.</hi> And the whole substance of the Romish, yea of all Christian Religion (saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) is the Masse. This then must be That same <hi>undiffering Christian Religion, which you both set up.</hi> And herein how much doe you dister? Have you not both your <hi>Altars,</hi> the main substance, on the <hi>service whereof all the rest attend, as your Priests, Sacrifice, Images, Crucifixes, Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Organs, curious musicke,</hi> and many other devises for your pompous <hi>service,</hi> your <hi>Liturgie</hi> differing more in the language, then in the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme?</hi> But you will say you differ in <hi>Transustantiation.</hi> Yet you are willing to have a reall Presence confessed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and professed with you, as is noted before. But you say, the difference is in certaine <hi>grosse corruptions indangering sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> On <hi>which side? Each side</hi> (say you) <hi>charges other.</hi> I have heard two <hi>butter women scold,</hi> and each layd to other grievous things, and the one said, <hi>Thou playdst the whore,</hi> and the other sayd, <hi>Thou playdst the whore.</hi> Which of these (trow you) was the honester Woman? She haply that had lesse playd the whore, then the other, which perhaps was not for want of <hi>will,</hi> but <hi>opportunity.</hi> You and <hi>Rome</hi> charge each other <hi>with grosse corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which yet, are <hi>one and the same</hi> in both. Doth not thus the shame of both the more appeare? Your <hi>grosse corruptions</hi> on both sides <hi>can agree well enough,</hi> if you can be quiet. Yea and that to the <hi>indangering of Salvation</hi> too. For have you not (to be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the rest) both your <hi>Altars,</hi> which are <hi>alone sufficient to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice upon all your faith and salvation, and so to leave you neither faith nor salvation in Christ,</hi> as whom also you sacrifice thereon, together with your <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>salvation?</hi> For we shewed before, that your <hi>Altars</hi> doe overthrow and deny <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> the onely <hi>Altar</hi> of true <hi>beleevers</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If then you both doe agree in the grossest

corruptions, as those whereby your <hi>salvation</hi> is not onely indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, but <hi>destroyed,</hi> which is the maine of your Religion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you differ not: what need there be any oddes between you for the rest? Both sides complain of each other, both have their <hi>corruptions,</hi> and grosse ones too, such as <hi>overthrow salvation.</hi> Then let your conscious ingenuity confesse to each other, and your conscientious <hi>Charity</hi>

For no such thing can appeare to any Reader, that is not so affected, as to beleeve your bare word, so soon as ever it sounds in his eare, or whose eyes doe not looke through the false glasse of your Perspective. Indeed you have proved to all men sufficiently both by this your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and by your Practises, that you and <hi>Rome</hi> do not set <hi>up a different Religion.</hi> We all beleeve it.
