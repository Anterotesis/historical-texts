            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>My Lords and Gentlemen,</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Think it fit, after so long absence, at this first occasion, to speak a few words unto you, but it is no wayes in answer to Master <hi>Speakers</hi> learned <hi>Speech:</hi> Albeit I have staid longer then I expected
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96510:3"/>
to have done when I went away, yet in this I have kept my promise with you, that I have made all the haste back again, that the setling of my <hi>Scotch</hi> affairs could any wayes permit, in which I have had so good successe, that I will confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm to you, that I have left that Nation a most peaceable and contented People; so that although I have a little misreckoned in time, yet I was not deceived in my end.</p>
            <p>But if I have deceived your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations a little in the time of my return, yet I am assured that my expectation is as much and more deceived in the condition wherein I hoped to have found businesses at my return. For since that before my going I setled the Liberties of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96510:3"/>
my Subjects, and gave the Lawes a free and orderly course, I expected to have found my People reaping the fruits of these benefits, by living in quietnesse, and satisfaction of minde: But in stead of this, I finde them disturbed with Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, Frights, and Alarms of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Designes and Plots; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of which, Guards have been set to defend both Houses: I say not this as in doubt that my Subjects affections are any way les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to me in this time of my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, for I cannot but remember, to my great comfort, the joyfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception I had now at my entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>London,</hi> but rather as I hope that my presence will easily disperse these fears. For I bring as perfect
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96510:4"/>
and true affections to my people as ever Prince did, or as good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects can possibly desire. And I am so far from repenting me of any Act I have done this Session for the good of my people, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, if it were to do again I would do it, and will yet grant what else can be justly desired for satisfaction in point of Liberties, or in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the true Religion that is here established.</p>
            <p>Now I have but one Particular to recommend unto you at this time, It is <hi>Ireland,</hi> for which though I doubt not your care, yet me thinks the preparations for it go but slowly on. The occasion is the fitter for me now to mention it, because of the arrivall of two Lords
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96510:4"/>
from <hi>Scotland,</hi> who come instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from my Councel there (who now by Act of Parliament have full power for that purpose) to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that Demand which it pleased both Houses to make me by way of Petition, that met me at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and which the Duke of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> sent back by my Command to my Scotch-Councel: Therefore my desire is, That both Houses would appoint a select Committee to end this businesse with these Noblemen. I must conclude in telling you, that I seek my peoples happinesse, for their flourishing is my greatest glory, and their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions my greatest strength.</p>
