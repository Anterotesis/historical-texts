            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Honourable, Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull,

Plantations.</head>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT HONOVRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Worshipfull, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:
It is an old, and yet a true
Prouerbe, <hi>Vis vnita fortior,</hi>
Vnited force is most vigorous:
I could haue commended this
poore Fatherlesse Volumne to
the simple perfection of some one man in eminence,
vnder whose shade it might obtaine a quiet rest.
But knowing your conioyned Society, doth extend
the branches of Charity, to a farther limit then some
one particular person, I am bold to present this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
to your tuition: assuring my selfe, that althogh
scandals may derogate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worth in this our home
bred Nation, your affection will finde it shipping to
<pb facs="tcp:6198:3"/>
transport it to the Land of security, where no biting
Satyre dares assayle it with his enuious teeth, or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
Critick, carpe to catch it with his AEnigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
braine. The reasons why this long obscured
Off-spring of Charity claimes your worthy particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Patronage, diuide themselues into a Tricotomie.
The first Reason is drawne from the supposed parent,
whose industrious seduline to the vast wombe of the
Ocean, describes these two Lands, now Cities of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
for poore impouerished persons. For his sake
therefore, whose wisedome liues crowned with the
Garland of Fame, though his bodie be buried in the
Sepulcher of Obliuion, protect this his poore extant
issue.</p>
            <p>The second Reason, proceedes from the remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
note of Christianity, which is Charity: For, by
<hi>this</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>shal all men know that
yee are my Disciples.</hi> As therefore you prize the
segregation of your selues from woluish Worldlings,
in Charity entertaine this submissiue petulent, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
at the Altar of your acceptance.</p>
            <p>The third Reason, yssues from your continued
and dayly exercise in the relapse of mean and decayed
persons, by transporting of them to a Land, where
they haue Corne which they sowed not, Vines which
they planted not, and plenty which some of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6198:3"/>Since therefore, so many haue felt the reuiuing
heate of the Sunne-beames of your Charity, whose
very intrals blesse you: amongst the multitude of
these, let this tonguelesse Orphant be one, that by
its birth into the World, though it cannot speake, it
may proue your praise. Thus with my seruice, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to speake for this infant, in the hehalfe of it,
I rest a Well-willer to your Businesse.</p>

            <p>GREAT is the misery that the Carkas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

hunger, pinching colde, pittifull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,

is the daungerous distresse of
their silly soules. For, they are the slaues
of <hi>Sathan,</hi> in the <hi>Galley of Idlenesse,</hi> fastened

<hi>Slothfulnesse,</hi> where extreame <hi>Cruelty,</hi> with

his huge Vessell, to remaine a famous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument,
vntill the end of the World.</p>
            <p>Excellently was that on-set giuen in
the making of sundry Statutes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leese
of the Impotent, and setting the ydle
on Worke: but if we consider how Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
hath ouerthrowne that Famous
Worke; wee shall finde, how Selfe-Loue
is setled farre into euerie mans heart, and
that we so hotly hunt after priuate Gaine,
that wee freezing coldly, seeke not any
Publike Profite. Wee play the sloathfull
hand, loath to come out of a warme pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
to heale and helpe to couer the whole
bodie from pinching cold.</p>
            <p>But come, come, deere Christians, let
euerie man now bee more mooued with
pittie. And according vnto their seuerall
Callinges, so charitably to further some
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6198:6"/>
good prouision, that the poore heereafter
may be otherwise <unclear>releeued</unclear>, and not bee
forced to beg or steale for maintenance.
And the ydle so set on Worke, that they be
not compelled to runne about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
haunting of Ale-houses, and vsing all
bad and wanton exercises, to driue away
the time withall. And let not Parishioners
do stil (as some do now) beare out theeues
in their theeuerie, for that they take their
prey with the Foxe, farre from his home,
which otherwise should charge the town.
Let them not winke at the matter, when
they finde the Theefe, and so the thing
stolne, nor make the Host of the Alehouse
their Constable, that diligent <hi>Setter</hi> for all
misorder, and Maister of mis-rule, their
cheefe Officer, to see good Order kepte.
Let them not suffer suspected persons, to
be playing in Ale-houses, especially in the
time of Diuine Seruice, nor play there for
more (at any time) then they haue honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gotten.</p>
            <p>And, whereas many poore Parents be
so foolish, to plant their Children on the

roote of ydlenesse, which will yeelde no

whereby our Countrey is pittifullie and
greeuously pestered, with such as for want

practise Robbing, Filching, Stealing,
Cozening, and such like. Now therefore,
I would heartily wish, that euerie Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

to beare other common Charges with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p>And how may I complaine therewith
of the decay of Hospitality in our Land,
whereby many poore soules are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6198:11"/>
of that releefe which they haue had
heeretofore. The time hath bene, that
men haue hunted after Worshippe and
Credite by good House-keeping, and
therein spent great part of their Reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes:
but now commonly, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of their Liuings, is too little to
maintaine vs and our Children in the
pompe of Pride: yea, and yet all is well
if wee may maintaine that, though no
Hospitallitie be maintained there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p>And thus, though the number of the
poore do dailie encrease, all things yet
worketh for the worst in their behalfe.
For, there hath beene no Collection
for them, no not these seuen yeares, in
many Parishes of this Land, especiallie
in Countrie townes; but many of those
Parishes turneth forth their poore, yea
and their lustie Labourers that will not
worke, or for any misdemeanor want
worke, to begge, filtch, and steale for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6198:11"/>
their maintainance, so that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
is pittifully pestered with them:
yea, and the maimed Soldiours, that
haue ventured their liues, and lost their
limbes in our behalfe, are also thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited:
For when they returne home,
to liue by some labour in their naturall
Countrey, though they can worke well
in some kinde of labour, euerie man
sayeth, Wee will not bee troubled with
their Seruice, but make other shifte for
our businesse So are they turned forth
to Trauaile, in Idlenesse (the highway
to Hell) and seeke their meate vppon
<hi>Meares</hi> (as the Prouerbe goeth,) with
Begging, Filching, and Stealing for
their maintenance, vntill the law bring
them vnto the fearefull end of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But our Sauiour Christ hath taught
vs Christians to do good vnto our Ene|
mies, and shall we then do nothing for
our Friends? If wee ought to loue them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6198:12"/>
that hatevs, shall we thus recompence
them that haue ventured life and limbe
for vs? No, no, for their good Seruice,
let vs see their bodies heereafter better
releeued, and some good and godlie
meanes vsed, to saue their soules from
the Torments of Hell, that GOD may
be better pleased, and those poor Soules
that fight for vs, much more anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>And I would wish all men to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the Lord of Heauen, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
those poore Soules, with the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-penie
of Life, that they might La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
in this his Vineyard or Common-Wealth,
and make it flow with all kinde
of Commodities. Then may not wee
which are Stewards, turne them foorth
of his seruice, to Cozen, Begge, Filch,
Steale, &amp; such like; excusing our selues,
that it is a trouble to vs to keepe them
in order, and so put vp the Lords allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in our owne purses: For then, hee
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6198:12"/>
hauing tried and found vs vnfaithfull
with the dust of the earth, will neuer
trust vs with the heritage of heauen.</p>
            <p>But no doubt some wil say, the fault
is in those poore people, that they are
not set on worke; they are either vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true,
froward, vnruly, slothfull, or some
such matter, which indeede I cannot
deny: but if there bee not the like, or
worse in vs, let vs be thankefull to God;
who thorough Grace hath made vs
Conquerors, of those naturall euilles.
And let not vs, because they of weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
goe ouer the shooes in sin, shew
so much vnchristian Crueltie to them,
to thrust them ouer head and eares into
Hell, by forcing them to liue by vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

            <p>Can wee not content our selues with

by that Theeuish Sathan, but wee
must much more cruelly, with our
