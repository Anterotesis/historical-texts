         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27285:9"/>
a beginning to time, and to the
world in time: It is the praiſe of
vs men if when we haue matter,
we can giue faſhion; thou gaueſt
a beeing to the matter, without
forme; thou gaueſt a form to that
matter, and a glory to that forme;
If wee can but finiſh a ſleight and
vnperfeſt matter, according to a
former patterne, it is the height
of our skill, but to beginne that
which neuer was, whereof there
was no example, whereto there
was no inclination, wherin there
was no poſsibility of that which
it ſhould bee, is proper onely to
ſuch power as thine; the infinite
power of an infinite creator: with
vs, not ſo much as a thought can

heere with thee, all matter ariſes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27285:9"/>

now the matter doth not more
praiſe thy power, then the forme

                     <p>Thou mighteſt haue made all

thus create. How ſhould we deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate

Neither did thy wiſedome heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

So we our ſelues in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

how vainely do wee hope to bee
perfect at once? It is well for vs, if
through many degrees wee can
riſe to our conſummation.</p>
                     <p>But (alas) what was the very he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
it ſelfe without light? how
confuſed? how formeleſſe? like to
a goodly body without a ſoule,
like a ſoule without thee. Thou
art light, and in thee is no darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Oh how incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
glorious is the light that is in
thee, ſince one glimpſe of this
created light gaue ſo liuely a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to al thy workemanſhip! This,
euen the bruite creatures can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold:
That, not the very Angels.
That ſhines foorth onely to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27285:11"/>
other ſupreme world of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality;
this to the baſeſt part of
thy creation. There is one cauſe
of our darkeneſſe on earth, and
of the vtter darkeneſſe in hell, the
reſtraint of thy light. Shine thou
O God, into the vaſt corners of
my ſoule, and in thy light I ſhall
ſee light.</p>
                     <p>But whence, O God, was that
firſt light? The ſunne was not
made till the fourth day, light the
firſt. If man had then beene, he
might haue ſeene all lightſome;
but whence it had come he could
not haue ſeene: As in ſome great
pond, we ſee the bancks full, wee
ſee not the ſprings whence that
water ariſeth. Thou that madeſt
the Sunne, madeſt the light, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:27285:11"/>
the Sunne, before the Sunne,
that ſo light might depend vpon
thee, and not vpon thy Creature.
Thy power will not be limited to
meanes. It was eaſie to thee to
make an heauen without a Sunne,
light without an heauen, day
without a Sunne, time without
a day: It is good reaſon thou
ſhouldeſt bee the Lord of thine
owne workes. All meanes ſerue
thee: why doe wee weake wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
diſtruſt thee; in the want of
thoſe meanes, which thou canſt
either command, or forbeare.
How plainly wouldſt thou teach
vs, that wee creatures neede not
one another, ſo long as wee haue
thee? One day we ſhall haue light
againe, without the Sunne. Thou
ſhalt be our Sunne; thy preſence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:27285:12"/>
ſhall be our light: Light is ſowne
for the righteous. This Sunne and
light is but for the world below it
ſelfe; thine only for aboue. Thou
giueſt this light to the Sunne,
which the Sunne giues to the
world: That light which thou
ſhalt once giue vs, ſhall make vs
ſhine like the Sunne in glory.</p>
                     <p>Now this light which for three
daies was thus diſperſed thorow
the whole heauens, it pleaſed
thee at laſt to gather and vnite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one body of the Sunne. The
whole heauen was our Sunne,
before the Sunne was created: but
now one ſtarre muſt be the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
of light to the heauen and
earth. How thou loueſt the vnion
and reduction of all things of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27285:12"/>
one kind to their owne head and
center.</p>
                     <p>So the waters muſt by thy
command be gathered into one
place, the ſea; ſo the vpper waters
muſt be ſeuered by theſe aery li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
from the lower: ſo heauy
ſubſtances haſten downeward,
aud light mount vp: ſo the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
light of the firſt daies muſt
bee called into the compaſſe of
one ſunne; ſo thou wilt once ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thine elect from all coaſts of
heauen to the participation of
one glory. Why doe wee abide
our thoughts and affections ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
from thee, from thy Saints,
from thine Annointed? Oh let
this light which thou haſt now
ſpread abroad in the hearts of all
thine, once meet in thee: Wee are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:27285:13"/>
as thy heauens in this their firſt
imperfection; be thou our Sunne,
into which our light may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
                     <p>Yet this light was by thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanged
with darknes, which
thou mightſt as eaſily haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to bee perpetuall. The
continuance euen of the beſt
things cloieth, and wearieth: there
is nothing but thy ſelfe, wherein
there is not ſatiety. So pleaſing is
the viciſsitude of things, that the
intercourſe euen of thoſe occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
which in their owne nature
are leſſe worthy, giues more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
then the vnaltered e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
of better. The day dies into
night; and riſes into the morning
againe; that we might not expect

Why are we not heere ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
as wee ſhall be heereafter?
Since thou haſt made vs children

vs to walk euer in the light of thy

error and vnbeleefe.</p>
                     <p>Now in this thine inlightned
frame, how fitly, how wiſely are
all the parts diſpoſed; that the
method of the creation might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the matter, the forme, both.
Behold all purity aboue; below,
the dregges and lees of all. The

each element ſuperiour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:27285:14"/>
not more in place then dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
that by theſe ſtaires of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
perfection our thoughts
might climbe vnto the top of all
glory, and might know thine em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreal
heauen no leſſe glorious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the viſible, than thoſe aboue
the earth. Oh how miſerable is
the place of our pilgrimage, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of our home! Let my ſoule
tread a while in the ſteps of thine
owne proceedings; and ſo thinke
as thou wroughteſt: When wee
would deſcribe a man, wee begin
not at the feete, but the head: The
head of thy Creation is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;
how high? how ſpatious?
how glorious? It is a wonder that
we can looke vp to ſo admirable
an height, and that the very eye is
not tyred in the way. If this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:27285:14"/>
line could bee drawne
right forwards, ſome that haue
calculated curiouſly haue found
it 500. yeares iourney vnto the
ſtarrie heauen. I doe not examine
their arte; O Lord, I wonder ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at thine, which haſt drawne
ſo large a line about this little
point of earth: For in the plaineſt
rules of art and experience, the
compaſſe muſt needs be ſix times
as much as halfe the height. Wee
thinke one Iland great, but the
earth vnmeaſurably. If wee were
in that heauen with theſe eies, the
whole earth (were it equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned)
would ſeeme as little to
vs, as now the leaſt ſtarre in the
firmament ſeemes to vs vpon
earth: And indeed, how few ſtars
are ſo little as it? And yet how
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:27285:15"/>
many void and ample ſpaces are
there beſides all the ſtarres? The
hugeneſſe of this thy worke, O
God, is little inferiour for admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the maieſty of it. But oh
what a glorious heauen is this
which thou haſt ſpred ouer our
heads? With how pretious a vault
haſt thou walled in this our infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
world? What worlds of light
haſt thou ſet aboue vs? Thoſe
things which wee ſee are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous;
but thoſe which wee
beleeue and ſee not, are yet more.
Thou doſt but ſet out theſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
view, to ſhew vs what there
is within. How proportionable
are thy works to thy ſelfe? Kings
erect not cotages, but ſet foorth
their magnificence in ſumptuous
buildings: ſo haſt thou done, O
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:27285:15"/>
King of glory. If the loweſt paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that heauen of thine bee
ſo glorious, what ſhall we thinke
of the better parts yet vnſeene?
And if this Sunne of thine bee of
ſuch brightneſſe and maieſty, oh
what is the glory of the maker of
it? And yet if ſome other of thy
ſtarres were let downe as low as
it, thoſe other ſtarres would bee
Sunnes to vs; which now thou
hadſt rather to haue admired in
their diſtance. And if ſuch a skie
be prepared for the vſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
euen of thine enemies alſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, how happie ſhall thoſe
eternall Tabernacles bee, which
thou haſt ſequeſtred for thine

                     <p>Behold then in this high and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:27285:16"/>
ſtately building of thine, I ſee
three ſtages; This loweſt heauen
for fowles, for vapours, for mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors:
The ſecond for the ſtarres:
The third for thine Angels and
Saints. The firſt is thine outward
Court, open for all: The ſecond
is the body of thy couered Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
wherin are thoſe candles of
heauen perpetually burning: The
third is thine Holy of Holies. In
the firſt is tumult, and vanity: In
the ſecond immutability &amp; reſt:
In the third glory and bleſſednes.
The firſt we feele, the ſecond we
ſee, the third we beleeue. In theſe
two lower is no felicity, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the fowles, nor ſtarres are
happy. It is the third heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
where thou, O bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
enioyeſt thy ſelfe, and thy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:27285:16"/>
glorified ſpirits inioy thee. It is
the manifeſtation of thy glorious
preſence that makes heauen to
be it ſelfe; This is the priuiledge
of thy children: that they he re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeeing
thee which art inuiſible by
the eye of faith, haue already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
that heauen which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſight of thee ſhall make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
aboue. Let my ſoule then
let theſe heauens alone till it may
ſee, as it is ſeeene. That wee may
deſcend to this loweſt and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
region of heauen, wherwith
our ſenſes are more acquainted;
What maruels doe euen heere
meete with vs? There are thy
clouds the bottles of raine, veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
as thin as the liquor which is
contained in them: there they
hange, and mooue, (though
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:27285:17"/>
mighty with their burden:) How
they are vpheld, and why they
fall, heere, and now, wee know
not, and wonder; theſe thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
one while as ſome aery ſeas
to hold water: an other while, as
ſome aery fornaces, whence thou
ſcattereſt thy ſudden fires vnto all
parts of the earth, aſtoniſhing the
world with the fearefull noyſe of
that eruption: out of the midſt of
water thou fetcheſt fire; and hard
ſtones out of the midſt of thinne
vapours; another while, as ſome
ſteele glaſſes, wherein the Sunne
lookes and ſhewes his face in the
variety of thoſe colours which he
hath not; There are thy ſtreames
of light, blazing and falling ſtars,
fires darted vp and downe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
formes, hollow openings, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:27285:17"/>
(as it were) gulfes in the skie;
bright circles about the moone,
and other planets, ſnowes, haile:
In all which it is enough to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
thine hand, though wee
cannot ſearch out thine action.
There are thy ſubtle windes,
which wee heare and feele, yet
neither can ſee their ſubſtance,
nor know their cauſes; whence
and whither they paſſe, and what
they are, thou knoweſt. There
are thy fowles of all ſhapes, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
notes, natures: whiles I
compare theſe with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of that other heauen, I find
thoſe ſtarres, and ſpirits like one
another: Theſe meteors and
fowles, in as many varieties, as
there are ſeuerall creatures. Why
is this? Is it becauſe man (for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:27285:18"/>
whoſe ſake theſe are made) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in change; thou in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie?
Or is it, that in theſe
thou maieſt ſhew thine owne
skill, and their imperfection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
There is no varietie in that which
is perfect, becauſe there is but
one perfection; and ſo much
ſhall wee grow neerer to perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
by how much wee draw
neerer to vnitie, and vniformitie.
From thence, if wee goe downe
to the great deepe, the wombe
of moiſture, the well of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
the great pond of the
world; wee know not whether
to wonder at the Element it ſelfe,
or the gueſts which it containes.
How doth that ſea of thine roare

how baſely are they laide vp? ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,

How ſhold we be conſecrated to

Euen this earthly part which

Man was made laſt, becauſe hee

If it bee the inſtrument, yet alſo

the clog in reſpect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.
Theſe external works
are effected by it, the internall
which are more noble, hindered;
Contrary to the bird which ſings

can be al things, can comprehend
all things; know that which is;
and conceiue of that which neuer

nothing can limit it but thou

The body was made of earth
common to his fellows, the ſoule

The body lay ſenſeleſſe vpon the

themſelues in their thoughts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

in their infuſion, &amp; infuſed them

Thou art alone after thine owne

No creature can bee like thee in

Yet of all viſible creatures thou

Behold wee were not more like

God we now praiſe our ſelues to
our ſhame, for the better we were

onlie doe thou whet our deſires
anſwerable to the readineſſe of

                     <p>I doe not finde that man thus
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:27285:26"/>
framed found the want of an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
His fruition of God gaue him
fulneſſe of contentment, the
ſweetneſſe which hee found in
the contemplation of this newe
workmanſhip, and the glory of
the author, did ſo take him vp,
that hee had neither leiſure nor
cauſe of complaint. If man had
craued an helper, he had grudged
at the condition of his creation,
and had queſtioned that which
he had, perfection of being. But
hee that gaue him his being, and
knew him better then himſelfe,
thinks of giuing him comfort in
the creature, whiles hee ſought
none but in his maker; Hee ſees
our wants, and forecaſts our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
when wee thinke our ſelues
too happy to complaine: How
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:27285:26"/>
ready will he be to helpe our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsities,
that thus prouides for
our perfection?</p>
                     <p>God giues the nature to his
creatures, Man muſt giue the
name, that hee might ſee they
were made for him, they ſhal be,
to him what hee will. In ſtead of
their firſt homage, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to their new Lord, and
muſt ſee of whom they hold. He
that was ſo carefull of mans ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty
in his innocence, how
can he be careleſſe of his ſafety in
his renouation?</p>
                     <p>If God had giuen them their
names, it had not bene ſo great
a praiſe of <hi>Adams</hi> memory to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
them as it was now of his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:27285:27"/>
iudgement (at firſt ſight) to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them, hee ſaw the inſide of
all the creatures at firſt; (his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
ſees but their skins euer
ſince;) and by this knowledge he
fitted their names to their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.
All that hee ſaw were fit
to be his ſeruants, none to be his
companions. The ſame God that
finds the want, ſupplies it. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then mans innocency ſhall
want an outward comfort, God
will begin a new creation. Not
out of the earth which was the
matter of man, not out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
creatures, which were the
ſeruants of Man, but out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
for dearneſſe, for equality.
Doubtleſſe ſuch was mans power
of obedience, that if God had bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
him yeeld vp his rib, waking,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:27285:27"/>
for this vſe, he had done it cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
but the bounty of God
was ſo abſolute, that hee would
not ſo much as conſult with mans
will, to make him happy. As man
knew not while hee was made, ſo
ſhal he not know while his other
ſelfe is made out of him: that the
comfort might be greater, which
was ſeene before it was expected.</p>
                     <p>If the woman ſhould haue bin
made, not without the paine, or
will of the man, ſhe might haue
bene vpbrayded with her depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and obligation. Now ſhee
owes nothing but to her creator:
The ribbe of <hi>Adam</hi> ſleeping, can
challenge no more of her, then
the earth can of him. It was an
happy change to <hi>Adam</hi> of a ribbe,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:27285:28"/>
for an helper; what help did that
bone giue to his ſide? God had
not made it, if it had beene ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous:
and yet if man could not
haue beene perfect without it, it
had not beene taken out.</p>
                     <p>Many things are vſe-ful &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,
which are not neceſſary,
and if God had ſeene man might
not want it, how eaſie had it been
for him which made the woman
of that bone, to turne the fleſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another bone? but he ſaw man
could not complaine of the want
of that bone, which hee had ſo
multiplied, ſo animated.</p>
                     <p>O God, wee can neuer be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
by thy changes, we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:27285:29"/>
but farre off, his maker thought
it requiſite to fit him with a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe

his body had beene ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous;
It was fit his body ſhould

only for contemplation, it would
haue ſerued as well to haue been
placed in ſome vaſt deſert, on the

But the ſame power which gaue
him an hart to meditate, gaue him
hands to worke; and work fit for

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:27285:29"/>
reioyceth to ſee all that hee had
made to be well; God loues to ſee

delight is his: they know not God
that thinke to pleaſe him with

                     <p>The Idolaters thought it a fit
ſeruice for <hi>Baal</hi> to cut and launce
themſelues; neuer any holy man
lookt for thanks from the true

earth was not fit for <hi>Adam,</hi> but
a Garden; a Paradiſe: What ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
pleaſures, and rare varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
haue men found in gardens
planted by the hands of men?
And yet all the world of men
cannot make one twig, or leafe, or

to our ſelues when God is libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall?
But for all this; if God had
not there conuerſed with man,
no abundance could haue made

                     <p>Yet beholde that which was

This firſt labor of his was as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

come to our Paradiſe:</p>
                     <p>Neither did theſe trees affoord
him onely action for his hands,
but inſtruction to his heart,
for here he ſaw Gods ſacraments
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:27285:31"/>

had a naturall vſe; theſe two in

Life is the act of the ſoule,
knowledge the life of the ſoule;
the tree of knowledge, and the
tree of life then, were ordained as
earthly helpes of the ſpirituall
part: Perhaps he which ordained
the ende, immortality of life; did
appoint this fruit as the meanes,
of that life; It is not for vs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after the life wee had; and
the meanes we ſhould haue had,
I am ſure it ſerued to nouriſh the

of that liuing tree, whoſe fruite
is eternall life, and whoſe leaues
ſerue to heale the nations.</p>
                     <p>O infinite mercy, man ſaw his

Sauiour before him; ere hee had
need of a Sauiour, hee ſaw in
whom hee ſhould recouer an
heauenly life, ere hee loſt the
earthly; but after man had taſted
of the tree of knowledge, hee
might not taſte of the tree of life;
That immortall food was not for
a mortall ſtomacke: Yet then did
he moſt ſauour that inuiſible tree
of life, when he was moſt reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                     <p>O Sauiour, none but a ſinner

liue for euer. The one tree
was for confirmation; the other
for tryall, one ſhewed him what
life hee ſhould haue, the other
what knowledge hee ſhould not
deſire to haue: Alas, he that knew
al other things, knew not this one
thing, that he knew enough: how
Diuine a thing is knowledge,
whereof euen innocencie it ſelfe
is ambitious? Satan knew what he
did, If this bayt had beene gold,
or honour, or pleaſure, man had
contemned it, who can hope to
auoide error, when euen mans
perfection is miſtaken? He lookt
for ſpeculatiue knowledge, hee
ſhould haue looked for experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall:
he thought it had beene
good to know euill: Good was
large enough to haue perfected
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:27285:32"/>
his knowledge, and therein his
bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                     <p>All that God made was good,
and the maker of them much
more good; they good in their
kinds, hee good in himſelfe. It
would not content him to know
God, and his creatures, his curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
affected to know that which
God neuer made, euill of ſin, and
euill of death, which indeed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
made, by deſiring to know

How dear hath this leſſon coſt vs

of the woman, in his plauſiblenes
of ſpeech to auoid terror, in his

to enuy and diſcontent, in his

                     <p>And if hee were ſo cunning at

him now, after ſo many thouſand
yeares experience? Onely thou,
(O God) and theſe Angels that
ſee thy face are wiſer then hee; I
doe not aske why, when hee left

him of his skill? Still thou
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:27285:34"/>
wouldſt haue him an Angell,
though an euill one, And thou
knoweſt how to ordaine his crait
to thine owne glory; I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
thee to abate of his ſubtilty,
but to make me wiſe; Let me beg
it without preſumption, make
me wiſer then <hi>Adam;</hi> euen thine
image which he bore, made him
not (through his owne weaknes)
wiſe enough to obey thee; thou
offeredſt him al fruits, and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt
but one; Satan offered him
but one and reſtrained not the
reſt; when he choſe rather to bee
at Satans feeding then thine, it
was iuſt with thee to turne him
out of thy gates, with a curſe: why
ſhouldeſt thou feede a rebell at
thine owne boord?</p>
                     <p>And yet wee tranſgreſſe daily,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:27285:34"/>
and thou ſhutteſt not heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
vs: how is it that wee find
more mercy then our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
His ſtrength is worthy of
ſeuerity, our weakneſſe finds pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
That God from whoſe face
he fled in the garden, now makes
him with ſhame to flye out of
the garden: thoſe Angels that
ſhould haue kept him, now keep
the gates of Paradiſe againſt him;
It is not ſo eaſie to recouer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,

Yea the ſame cauſe that droue

                     <p>There was neuer any nature

that was not bloody; for if it eat
not anothers hart, it will eat our
owne, but vnleſſe it be reſtrained
it will ſurely feed it ſelfe with the
blood of others, oft times in act,
alwaies in affection. And that
God which (in good) accepts the
will for the deed, condemns the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:27285:39"/>
will for the deed in euill. If there
be an euill heart, there will bee an
euill eye, and if both theſe, there
will be an euill hand</p>
                     <p>How earely did Martyrdome
come into the world? The firſt
man that died, died for religion;
who dare meaſure Gods loue by
outward euents, when hee ſees
wicked <hi>Cain</hi> ſtanding ouer blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Abel;</hi> whoſe ſacrifice was firſt
accepted, and now himſelfe is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed.
Death was denounced to
man as a curſe; yet behold it firſt
lights vppon a Saint, how ſoone
was it altered by the mercy of
that iuſt hand which inflicted it?
If death had beene euill, and life
good; <hi>Cain</hi> had beene ſlaine, and
<hi>Abel</hi> had ſuruiued, now that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:27285:39"/>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Abel</hi> ſayes nothing, his blood
cries: Euery drop of innocent
blood hath a tongue, and is not
onely vocall, but importunate,
what a noiſe then did the blood
of my Sauiour make in heauen,
who was himſelfe the ſhepheard
and the ſacrifice; The man that
was offered, and the God to
whome it was offered; The ſpirit
that herd both ſaies, it ſpake bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Abels</hi> blood called for reuenge
his for mercy; <hi>Abels</hi> pleaded his
owne innocency, his, the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

<hi>Abels</hi> procured <hi>Cains</hi> puniſhment,
his, freed all repentant ſouls from

                     <p>No ſooner doth <hi>Abels</hi> blood
ſpeake vnto God, then God
ſpeaks to <hi>Cain;</hi> There is no wicked

if not to his eare, yet to his heart:
what ſpeech was this? Not an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
but an inquiry, yet ſuch
an enquiry as would infer an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
God loues to haue a

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:27285:40"/>

The very name of <hi>Abel</hi> wounds
him no leſſe, then his hand had
wounded <hi>Abel:</hi> Conſciences that
are without remorſe, are not
without horror: wickednes makes
men deſperate; the murderer is
angry with God, as of late for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
his brothers oblation, ſo
now for liſtening to his blood.</p>
                     <p>And now he dares anſwer God
with a queſtion, Am I my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
keeper? where he ſhold haue
ſaid, am not I my brothers mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.
Behold he ſcorneth to keep
whom he feared not to kill, Good
duties are baſe and troubleſome
to wicked minds, whiles euen vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences
of euill are pleaſant, Yet
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:27285:41"/>
this miſcreant which neither had
grace to auoid his ſinne, nor to
confeſſe it, now that he is conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of ſinne, and curſed for it, how
he howleth, how he exclaimeth?
Hee that cares not for the act of
his ſinne, ſhall care for the ſmart
of his puniſhment. The damned
are weary of their torments, but
in vaine. How great a madneſſe is
it to complaine too late; He that
would not keepe his brother, is
caſt out from the protection of
God; he that feared not to kill his
brother, feares now, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
meets him will kill him. The
troubled conſcience proiecteth
fearefull things, and ſin makes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
cruell men cowardly: God
ſaw it was too much fauour for
him to dye: he therfore wils that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:27285:41"/>
which <hi>Cain</hi> wils; <hi>Cain</hi> would liue;
It is yeelded him, but for a curſe,
how oft doth God heare ſinners
in anger? Hee ſhall liue, baniſhed
from God, carying his hell in his
boſome, and the brand of Gods
vengeance in his forehead, God
reiects him, the earth repines at
him, men abhorre him; himſelfe
now wiſhes that death which he
feared, and no man dare pleaſure
him with a murder; how bitter is
the end of ſin, yea without end;
ſtill <hi>Cain</hi> finds that he killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
more then his brother, wee
ſhould neuer ſin if our foreſight
were but as good as our ſence;
The iſſue of ſin would appeare a
thouſand times more horrible,
then the act is Pleaſant.</p>

                     <p>THe world was grown ſo foul

ſo cloſe did wickednes cleaue to

ſticke in the very graine of the
earth; that God ſaw it meet to let

vnder the Law, the very veſſels
that had touched vncleane water
muſt either be rinced, or broken,
Mankind began but with one,
and yet he that ſaw the firſt man,

whereupon the waters came
downe from heauen, and ſwelled
vp to heauen againe, If there had
not been ſo deepe a deluge of ſin,
there had beene none of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
From whence then was this
ſuperfluity of iniquity? Whence,
but from the vnequall yoke with
Infidels? Theſe mariages did not
beget men, ſo much as wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
from hence religious huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands

That which was the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

the increaſe of ſinne, A woman

ſinned, died; the moſt ſins
begin at the eyes, by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Satan creeps into the hart
that ſoule can neuer bee in ſafety
that hath not couenanted with
his eyes.</p>
                     <p>God needed not haue giuen
theſe men any warning of his
iudgement, They gaue him no
warning of their ſins, no reſpite:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:27285:43"/>
yet that God might approue his
mercies to the very wicked; hee
giues them an hundred &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
yeares reſpite of repenting,
how loath is God to ſtrike, that
threats ſo long, hee that delights
in reuenge, ſurpriſes his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whereas hee that giues long
warnings deſires to be preuented
if we were not wilfull, we ſhould
neuer ſmart.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth hee giue them
time onely, but a faithful teacher.
It is an happy thing when hee
that teacheth others is righteous;
<hi>Noahs</hi> hand taught them as much
as his tongue. His buſineſſe in
building the Arke was a reall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the world, wherein at
once were taught mercy and life
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:27285:44"/>
to the beleuers; and to the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Mee thinks I ſee thoſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
ſonnes of <hi>Lamech</hi> comming
to <hi>Noah,</hi> and asking him, what he
meanes by that ſtrange worke;
whether hee meane to ſaile vpon
the dry land. To whom when he
reports Gods purpoſe, and his,
they go away laughing at his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlenes,
and tell one another, in
ſport, that too much holineſſe
hath made him mad: yet cannot
they al flout <hi>Noah</hi> out of his faith,
he preaches and builds and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes.
Doubtles more hands went
to this work than his: many a one
wrought vpon the Arke, which
yet was not ſaued in the Arke.
Our outward works cannot ſaue
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:27285:44"/>
vs without our faith, wee may
helpe to ſaue others, and periſh
our ſelues: what a wonder of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is this that I here ſee? One poor
family called out of a world, and
as it were eight graines of corne
fanned from a whole barne ful of
chaffe: one hypocrite was ſaued
with the reſt, for <hi>Noahs</hi> ſake, not
one righteous man was ſwept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
for companie; For theſe few
was the earth preſerued ſtill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the waters; and all kinds of
creatures vpon the waters; which
elſe had been all deſtroyed. Still
the world ſtands, for their ſakes,
for whom it was preſerued; Elſe
fire ſhould conſume that, which
could not be cleanſed by water.</p>
                     <p>This difference is ſtrange; I ſee
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:27285:45"/>
the ſauageſt of all creatures, lions
tygers; beares by an inſtinct from
God come to ſeeke the Arke, (as
we ſee Swine foreſeeing a ſtorme,
run home crying for ſhelter; men
I ſee not; Reaſon once debauched
is worſe then brutiſhneſſe: God
hath vſe even of theſe fierce and
cruell beaſts, and glorie by them,
even they being created for man,
muſt liue by him, though to his
puniſhment: how greatly do they
offer &amp; ſubmit themſelues to their
preſeruer; renewing that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
to this repairer of the world
which, they before ſin, yeelded
to him that firſt ſtored the world:
He that ſhut them into the Arke
when they were entred, ſhut
their mouths alſo while they did
enter. The Lions faune vpon <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:27285:45"/>
and <hi>Daniel;</hi> What hart cannot
the maker of them mollifie?</p>
                     <p>The vnclean beaſts God would
haue to liue, the cleane to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie;
and therefore hee ſends to
<hi>Noah</hi> ſeauen of the cleane, of the
vncleane two: He knew the one
would annoy man with their
multitude, the other would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
him; Thoſe things are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of moſt reſpect which are of
moſt vſe.</p>
                     <p>But why ſeven? Surely that
God that created ſeuen daies in
the week, and made one for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
did heere preſerue of ſeuen
cleane beaſts, one for himſelfe;
for Sacrifice: He giues vs ſixe for
one in earthly things, that in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:27285:46"/>
we ſhould be all for him.</p>
                     <p>Now the day is come, all the
gueſts are entred, the Ark is ſhut,
and the windowes of heauen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened:
I doubt not but many of
thoſe ſcoffers, when they ſaw the
violence of the waters deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and aſcending, according
to <hi>Noahs</hi> prediction, came wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
middle-deep vnto the Ark,
and importunately craued that
admittance, which they once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
But now, as they formerly
reiected God, ſo are they iuſtly
reiected of God: Ere vengeance
begin, repentance is ſeaſonable;
but if iudgement bee once gone
out, wee cry too late; while the
Goſpell ſolicites vs, the doores of
the Arke are open; if wee neglect
the time of grace, in vaine ſhal we
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:27285:46"/>
ſeeke it with teares, God holds it
no mercy to pitty the obſtinate.
Others more bolde then they,
hope to ouer-runne the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and climbing vp to the hye
mountaines looke downe vppon
the waters, with more hope then
feare: and now when they ſee
their hils become Ilands, they
climbe vp into the talleſt trees
there with palenes and horror at
once looke for death, &amp; ſtudy to
auoid it, whom the waues ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
at laſt halfe dead with famin
and halfe with fear. Lo now from
the tops of the mountaines they
deſcrie the Ark floting vpon the
waters, and beholde with enuy
that which before they beheld
with ſcorne.</p>
                     <p>In vain doth he flie whom God
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:27285:47"/>
purſues. There is no way to flie
from his iudgements, but to flie
to his mercy by repenting. The
faith of the righteous cannot bee
ſo much derided, as their ſucceſſe
is magnified: How ſecurely doth
<hi>Noah</hi> ride out this vprore of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
earth, and waters? He heares
the powring downe of the raine
aboue his head, the ſhrieking of
men, and roaring, and bellowing
of beaſts, on both ſides him, the
raging and threats of the waues
vnder him, hee ſaw the miſerable
ſhifts of the diſtreſſed vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers;
and in the meane time ſits
quietly in his drye Cabin, neither
feeling nor fearing euill, he knew
that he which owed the waters,
would ſteere him, that hee who
ſhut him in, would preſerue him.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:27285:47"/>
How happy a thing is faith?
What a quiet ſafety, what an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
peace doth it worke in the
ſoule, in the midſt of all the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of euill?</p>
                     <p>Now when God had fetcht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
all the life which he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to his vnworthy creatures,
and reduced the world vnto his
firſt forme wherein waters were
ouer the face of the earth, it was
time for a renouation of al things
to ſucceed this deſtruction; To
haue continued this deluge long,
had beene to puniſh <hi>Noah,</hi> that
was righteous; After fourty daies
therefore, the heauens cleare vp,
after 150. the waters ſink downe:
How ſoone is God weary of
puniſhing, which is neuer wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:27285:48"/>
of bleſsing; yet may not the
Arke reſt ſuddenly, If we did not
ſtay ſom-while vnder Gods hand
we ſhould not know how ſweete
his mercy is, and how great our
thankfulneſſe ſhould bee, The
Arke though it was <hi>Noahs</hi> ſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the waters, yet it was his
priſon, he was ſafe in it, but pent
vp; hee that gaue him life by it,
now thinks time to giue him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
out of it.</p>
                     <p>God doth not reueale all things
to his beſt ſeruants, beholde hee
that tolde <hi>Noah</hi> 120. yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
what day he ſhould go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Arke, yet foretels him not
now in the Arke what day the
Arke ſhould reſt vpon the hils,
and hee ſhould goe forth; <hi>Noah</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:27285:48"/>
therfore ſends out his intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
the Rauen, and the Doue:
whoſe wings in that vaporous
ayre might eaſily deſcry further
then his ſight: The Rauen of
quicke ſent, of groſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eede, of
tough conſtitution, no foule was
ſo fit for diſcouery; the likelieſt
things alwaies ſucceed not; Hee
neither will venter farre into that
ſolitary world for feare of want,
nor yet come into the Arke for
loue of liberty; but houers about
in vncertainties. How many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
minds flye out of the Arke of
Gods Church; and imbrace the
preſent world: rather chooſing to
feed vpon the vnſauory carcaſſes
of ſinfull pleaſures; then to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
within the ſtraite liſts of
Chriſtian obedience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:27285:49"/>
The Doue is ſent forth, a foule,
both ſwift and ſimple. She like a
true citizen of the Arke, returnes;
and brings faithfull notice; of the
continuance of the waters by her
reſtleſſe and empty returne; by
her Oliue leafe, of the abatement:
how woorthy are thoſe meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to be welcome, which with
innocence in their liues, bring
glad tidings of peace, and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in their mouthes?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Noah</hi> reioyces, and beleeues; yet
ſtill hee waites ſeuen daies more:
It is not good to deuoure the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
of God too greedily; but
ſo take them in, that wee may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
them: oh ſtrong faith of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
that was not weary with this
delay; ſome man would haue ſo
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:27285:49"/>
longed for the open ayre after ſo
long cloſenes, that vpon the firſt
notice of ſafety hee would haue
vncouered, and voyded the Ark;
<hi>Noah</hi> ſtayes ſeuen daies ere hee
will open; and well neere two
moneths ere hee will forſake the
Arke; and not then, vnleſſe God
that commanded to enter, had
bidden him depart. There is no
action good without faith: no
faith without a word. Happy is
that man which in all things
(neglecting the counſels of

<hi>Cham</hi> ſaw it and laughed, his

ſhould haue begotten in him a

Twiſe had <hi>Noah</hi> giuen him life,

but worſe in the tongue: As all ſin

                     <p>Yet it was well for <hi>Noah</hi> that

our friends. Behold how loue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth
ſinnes, theſe good ſonnes
are ſo farre from going forward
to ſee their fathers ſhame, that
they goe backeward to hide it,
The cloake is laide on both their

quall paces, and dare not ſo much
as looke backe leſt they ſhould
vnwillingly ſee the cauſe of their
ſhame, and will rather aduenture
to ſtumble at their fathers body
then to ſee his nakedneſſe: How
did it greeue them to thinke that
they which had ſo oft come to
their holy father with reuerence
muſt now in reuerence turn their
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:27285:58"/>
backes vpon him; and that they
muſt now cloath him in pitty,
which had ſo often clothed them
in loue: And which addes more
to their duty, they couered him,
and ſaide nothing. This modeſt
ſorrow is their praiſe, and our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
The ſins of thoſe wee loue

Though men could not but
ſee the fearefull monuments of

how quickly had they forgotten
a floud? Good <hi>Noah</hi> liued to ſee
the world both populous, and
wicked again. And doubtles oft-times
repented to haue beene the
preſeruer of ſome whom hee ſaw
to traduce the vices of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
world, to the renewed: It
could not but grieue him to ſee
the deſtroyed giants reuiue out
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:27285:60"/>
of his own loyns, and to ſee them
of his fleſh and bloud tiranniſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
themſelues. In his ſight <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
caſting off the awe of his holy
grandfather, grew imperious and
cruell, and made his owne kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſeruants. How eaſie a thing
it is for a great ſpirit to bee the
head of a faction; when euen bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
will ſtoop to ſeruitude; And
now when men are combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
euill and preſumptuous
motions finde incouragement in
multitudes; and each man takes a
pride in ſeeming forwardeſt, wee
are the cheerfuller in good when
wee haue the aſsiſtance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
much more in ſinning, by
how much we are more prone to

word (Come let vs build vs a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:27285:60"/>
and a towre whoſe top may

                     <p>They were newly come down

now thinke of raiſing vp an hill
of building in the plaine, when
their tents were pitched vpon the

muſt needs aſpire to an

matter of boaſting in her owne
workes.</p>
                     <p>How fondly doe men reckon
without God, Come let vs build;
As if there had beene no ſtop but

and time had beene theirs: Still
doe all naturall men build <hi>Babell;</hi>
forecaſting their owne plots ſo

iuſt with God that peremptory

Whereas thoſe things which are

                     <p>Let vs build vs a city, if they had
taken God with them it had bin
commendable, eſtabliſhing of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
is pleaſing to him that is
the God of order: But a towre
whoſe top may reach to Heauen,
was a ſhameful arrogance, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
preſumption; who would
thinke that wee little Ants that
creepe vpon this earth ſhould
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:27285:61"/>
thinke of climbing vp to heauen,
by multiplying of earth?</p>
                     <p>Pride euer looks at higheſt, the
firſt man would know as God,
theſe would dwell as God; coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſneſſe
and ambition know
no limits. And what if they had
reacht vp to heauen, ſome hils
are as high as they could hope to
be, and yet are no whit the better;
no place alters the condition of
nature, an Angell is glorious,
though hee bee vpon earth; and
man is but earth though he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the clouds: The neerer they
had beene to heauen the more
ſubiect ſhould they haue been to
the violences of heauen; to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:27285:62"/>

that heauen ſhould bee lookt at,
and affected with all humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,

of our owne atchieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>But wherefore was all this? Not
that they loued ſo much to bee
neighbours to heauen, as to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
vpon earth; It was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
that was heere ſought,
not ſafety, but glory: whither
doth not thirſt of fame cary men?
whether in good or euil: It makes
them ſeek to climbe to heauen, it
makes them not fear to run down
headlong to hell: Euen in the beſt
things deſire of praiſe ſtands in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:27285:62"/>
competition with conſcience, and
brags to haue the more clients.
One builds a Temple to <hi>Diana</hi> in
hope of glory, intending it for
one of the great wonders of the
world; another in hope of fame
burnes it. Hee is a rare man that
hath not ſome <hi>Babel</hi> of his owne,
whereon he beſtowes paines and
coſt, onely to be talked of. If they
had done better things in a vain-glorious
purpoſe; their act had
beene accurſed; if they had built
houſes to God, if they had giuen
almes to men, if they had ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
prayed, liued well; the intent
poiſons the action; but now both
the act and the purpoſe are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
vain, and the iſſue is as vain
as either.</p>
                     <p>God hath a ſpeciall indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:27285:63"/>
at pride aboue all ſins, and wil
croſſe our endeuours not for that
they are euil (what hurt could be
in laying one bricke vppon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?)
but for that they are proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vndertaken: Hee could haue
hindered the laying of the firſt
ſtone; and might as eaſily haue
made the trench for the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the graue of the builders:
But hee loues to ſee what wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men would doe; and to let
fooles runne themſelues out of
breath; what monument ſhould
they haue had of their own mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and his powerfull interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if the walls had riſen to no
height? To ſtop them then in the
midſt of their courſe, he meddles
not with either their hands, or
their feet, but their tongues; not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:27285:63"/>
by pulling them out, not by loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
their ſtrings, not by making
them ſay nothing, but by teching
them to ſay too much: Here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
varied but the ſound of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
euen this fruſtrates the work,
and befooles the workmen: How
eaſie is it for God tenne thouſand
waies to correct and foreſtall the
greateſt proiects of men? Hee
that taught <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt words,
taught them words that neuer
were. One cals for bricke, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
looks him in the face, and
wonders what hee commands,
and how and why he ſpeaks ſuch
words, as were neuer heard, and
in ſtead thereof brings him mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
returning him an anſwer as
little vnderſtood, ech chides with
other, expreſsing his choler ſo, as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:27285:64"/>
hee onely can vnderſtand him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
From heat they fall to quiet
intreaties, but ſtill with the ſame
ſucceſſe. At firſt euery man thinks
his fellow mocks him, but now
perceiuing this ſerious confuſion
their onely anſwere was ſilence,
and ceaſing; they could not come
together, for no man could call
them to be vnderſtood; &amp; if they
had aſſembled nothing could be
determined, becauſe one could
neuer attaine to the others pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
No, they could not haue
the honour of a generall diſmiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but each man leaues his trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
and ſtation more like a foole
then hee vndertooke it, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
actions begun in glory,
ſhut vp in ſhame. All externall
actions depend vpon the tongue,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27285:64"/>
No man can know others mind,
if this bee not the interpreter;
hence as there were many toungs
giuen to ſtay the building of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
ſo there were as many giuen
to build the new Ieruſalem, the
Euangelicall Church. How deare
hath <hi>Babel</hi> coſt all the world? At
the firſt when there was but one
language, men did ſpend their
time in Arts; (ſo was it requiſit at
the firſt ſetling of the world, and
ſo came early to perfection) but
now we ſtay ſo long (of neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
vpon the ſhel of tongues, that
we can hardly haue time to chew
the ſweet kernell of knowledge:
Surely men would haue growne
too proud if there had beene no
<hi>Babel:</hi> It fals out oft-times that
one ſinne is a remedy of a greater.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:27285:65"/>
Diuiſion of tongues muſt needs
ſlacken any worke: Multiplicitie
of language had not bin giuen by
the Holy ghoſt for a bleſsing to
the Church, if the world had not
beene before poſſeſſed with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicitie
of languages, for a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment:
Hence it is that the
building of our Sion riſes no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
becauſe our tongues are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided;
Happy were the Church
of God if we al ſpake but one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
Whiles wee differ, wee can
build nothing but <hi>Babel;</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of tongues cauſed their <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>

for in a ſet copie euery fault is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,

paſſed; the laſt was the ſoreſt: No

that boſome in which hee deſires
to reſt, ſo aſſaulted with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<hi>Abraham</hi> muſt leaue his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
and kinred, and liue among
ſtrangers; The calling of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
leaues men, where it finds
them, the earth is the Lords; and
all places are alike to the wiſe and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:27285:66"/>
faithfull: If Chaldea had not been

not left it; no bond muſt tie vs to
the danger of infection:</p>
                     <p>But whether muſt he go? To a
place he knew not, to men that
knew not him: it is enough com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to a good man, whereſoeuer
he is, that hee is acquainted with
God, we are neuer out of our way
while wee follow the calling of
God. Neuer any man loſt by his
obedience to the higheſt: becauſe
<hi>Abraham</hi> yeelded, God giues him
the poſſeſsion of <hi>Canaan:</hi> I wonder
more at his faith in taking this
poſſeſsion, then in leauing his
owne; Beholde <hi>Abraham</hi> takes
poſſeſsion for that ſeed which he
had not; which in nature hee was
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:27285:66"/>
not like to haue; of that land wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

wherein his ſeede ſhould not bee

preuent time; and make future
things preſent; If wee be the true

                     <p>Yet euen Canaan doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord

In outward things Gods enemies

Thriſe had Aegypt preſerued the

<hi>Iaacob,</hi> in Chriſt; God oft-times
makes vſe of the world for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe

their thanks; as contrarily, he vſes
the wicked for ſcourges to his

becauſe in his good they intended
euill.</p>
                     <p>But what a change is this? Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto

No ſtrength of faith can exclude

                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:27285:67"/>
ſaith, The Egyptians will
kill me: He that liued by his faith,
yet ſhrinketh, and ſinneth. How
vainely ſhall we hope to beleeue
without al feare, and to liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
infirmities? Some little aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of vnbeleefe cannot hinder
the praiſe and power of faith; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
beleeued, and it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted

Hee that through inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
doubted twiſe of his owne

Sometimes the beleeuer ſtickes
at eaſie tryalls, and yet breakes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:27285:68"/>
through the greateſt temptations
without feare: <hi>Abraham</hi> was olde
ere this promiſe and hope of a

                        <hi>Abraham</hi> heard this newes from

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:27285:68"/>
of doing, and the intention of

within her ſelfe and is bewraied:
How God can find vs out in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

now ſhe that laughed and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

                     <p>What a liuely patterne doe I
ſee in <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; <hi>Sarah,</hi> of a ſtrong
faith and weake, of ſtrong in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
and weake in <hi>Sarah:</hi> Shee
to make God good of his worde
to Abraham, knowing her owne
barrenneſſe, ſubſtitutes an <hi>Hagar,</hi>
and in an ambition of ſeed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
to Poligamy. <hi>Abraham</hi>
had neuer looked to obtaine the

promiſe by any other then a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
wombe, if his owne wife had
not importunde him to take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
when our owne apparent
meanes faile, weake faith is put to
ſhifts; and proiects ſtrange deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of her owne to attaine her end.
She will rather conceiue by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wombe then bee childleſſe:
when ſhe heares of an impoſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to nature, ſhe doubreth, and
yet hides her diffidence; and when
ſhe muſt beleeue, feareth, becauſe
ſhe did diſtruſt: <hi>Abraham</hi> heares
and beleeues and expects and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyces;
he ſaith not, I am old and
weake; <hi>Sarah</hi> is olde and barren,
where are the many nations that
ſhall come from theſe withered
loynes? It is enough to him that
God hath ſaid it, he ſees not the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:27285:69"/>
meanes, he ſees the promiſe. He
knew that God would rather
raiſe him vp ſeede from the very
ſtones that hee trod vpon, then
himſelfe ſhould want a large and
happy iſſue.</p>
                     <p>There is no faith where there
is neither meanes or hopes. Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and impoſsibilities are the
true obiects of beleefe: Hereupon
God ads to his name that which
he would fetch from his loynes,
and made his name as ample as
his poſterity: neuer any man was
a looſer by beleeuing: Faith is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
recompenſed with glory.</p>
                     <p>Neither is <hi>Abraham</hi> content
only to wait for God, but to ſmart
for him; God bids him cut his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:27285:70"/>
owne fleſh; he willingly ſacrifices
this parcell of his skin and blood,
to him that was the owner of all:
How glad he is to carry this pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
marke of the loue of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
How forward to ſeale this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
with blood betwixt God
and him, not regarding the ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his body in compariſon
of the confirmation of his ſoule;
The wound was not ſo grieuous
as the ſignification was comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For herein hee ſaw that from
his loynes ſhould come that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſeed which ſhould purge his
ſoule from all corruption: well is
that part of vs loſt, which may
giue aſſurance of the ſaluation of
the whole; our faith is not yet
ſound, if it haue not taught vs to
neglect paine for God, and more
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:27285:70"/>
to loue his Sacraments, then our
owne fleſh.</p>

                     <p>Theſe would haue beene the

In an holy wilfulneſſe hee

here is neither grudging

His faith would not ſuffer him ſo

miſery which muſt be, is mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with ſpeed, and aggrauated
with delay: All this while if <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

leiſure to returne. There is no

what a deuotion is this
that will abide no witneſſes, hee
will not ſuffer two of his owne

afraid of that piety, which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
could not ſee without
horror, without reſiſtance, which
no eare could heare of without
abhomination. What ſtranger

                     <p>But if <hi>Abrahams</hi> hart could haue

where is the ſacrifice? I know not

did not ſtrike <hi>Abraham</hi> as deep, as
the knife of Abraham could ſtrike
his ſon: yet doth he not ſo much
as thinke, (O miſerable man that

(not without aſtoniſhment) the
ſtrange command of God, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
will of his Father: My ſonne
thou art the lambe which God
hath prouided for this burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering;
If my blood would haue
excuſed thee, how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times had I rather to giue
thee my own life, then take thine
Alas I am full of daies, and now of
long liued not but in thee; Thou
mighteſt haue preſerued the life
of thy father and haue comforted
his death, but the God of vs both
hath choſen thee; Hee that gaue
thee vnto mee miraculouſly, bids
me by an vnuſuall meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:27285:75"/>
thee vnto him. I neede not
tell thee, that I ſacrifice all my
worldly ioyes, yea and my ſelfe in
thee, but God muſt bee obeyed;
neither art thou too deere for
him that calls thee: come on my
ſon, reſtore the life that God hath
giuen thee by mee: offer thy ſelfe
willingly to thoſe flames, ſend vp
thy ſoule cheerefully vnto thy
glorie; and know that God loues
thee aboue others, ſince hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
thee alone to be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in ſacrifice to himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Who cannot imagine with
what perplexed mixtures of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
with what changes of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
what doubts, what fears,
what amazement good <hi>Iſaac</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
this ſudden meſſage from
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:27285:76"/>
the mouth of his Father, how hee
queſtioned, how he pleaded; but
when hee had ſomwhat digeſted
his thoughts, and conſidered that
the Author was God, the actor
<hi>Abraham,</hi> the action a ſacrifice, he
now approoues himſelfe the ſon
of <hi>Abraham;</hi> now hee incourages
the trembling hands of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
with whom he ſtriues in this
praiſe of forwardnes, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
now he offers his hands and
feet to the cords, his throat to the
knife, his body to the altar; and
growing ambitious of the ſword
and fire, intreates his father to do
that, which he would haue done
though hee had diſſwaded him;
O holy emulation of faith! O
bleſſed agreement of the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
and oblation: <hi>Abraham</hi> is as
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:27285:76"/>
ready to take, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> to giue, He
binds thoſe deare hands which
are more ſtraitly bound with the
cords of duty, and reſolution; hee
laies his ſacrifice vpon the wood,
which now before hand burnt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
with the heauenly fire of
zeale and deuotion.</p>
                     <p>And now hauing kiſſed him
his laſt, not without mutual tears,
hee lifts vp his hand to fetch the
ſtroke of death at once; not ſo
much as thinking, perhaps God
will relent after the firſt wound;
Now the ſtay of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the
hope of the Church lies on blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vnder the hand of a Father,
what bowells can chooſe but
yearne at this ſpectacle; which of
the ſauageſt heathens that had
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:27285:77"/>
beene now vpon the hill of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,
and had ſeene through the
buſhes the ſword of a father han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
ouer the throat of ſuch a ſon
would not haue beene more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
in his thoughts, then that
vnexpected ſacrifice was in thoſe
briers: yet hee whom it neereſt
concerned, is leaſt touched, Faith
hath wrought the ſame in him,
which cruelty would in others,
not to be moued; Hee contemns
all feares, and ouerlooks all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibilities;
His heart tells him
that the ſame hand which raiſed
<hi>Iſaac</hi> from the dead womb of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi>
can raiſe him again from the
aſhes of his ſacrifice: with this
confidence was the hand of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
now falling vppon the
throat of <hi>Iſaac</hi> who had giuen
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:27285:77"/>
himſelfe for dead, and reioyced in
the change; when ſuddenly the
Angel of God interrupts him,
forbids him, commends him.</p>
                     <p>The voice of God was neuer ſo
welcome, neuer ſo ſweet, neuer ſo
ſeaſonable as now: It was the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
that God intended, not the
fact; <hi>Iſaac</hi> is ſacrificed, and is yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue,
and now both of them are
more happy in that they would
haue done, then they could haue
beene diſtreſſed if they had done
it. Gods charges are oft times
harſh in the beginnings, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
but in the concluſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
comfortable: True ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
comforts are commonly late
and ſudden: God differr's on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that our trials may bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:27285:78"/>
our deliuerance welcome,
our recompence glorious: <hi>Iſaac</hi>
had neuer beene ſo pretious to
his father if he had not beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
from death; if he had not
beene as miraculouſly reſtored
as giuen: <hi>Abraham</hi> had neuer bin
ſo bleſſed in his ſeed, if hee had
not neglected <hi>Iſaac</hi> for God.</p>
                     <p>The only way to find comfort
in any earthly thing is to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it (in a faithfull careleſneſſe)
into the hands of God: <hi>Abraham</hi>
came to ſacrifice, he may not goe
away with drye hands: God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
abide that good purpoſes
ſhould be fruſtrate: leſt either he
ſhould do that, for which he came
or ſhould want meanes of ſpeedy
thankeſgiuing for ſo gratious a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:27285:78"/>
appointment. Beholde a Ram
ſtands ready for the ſacrifice, and
as it were, proffers himſelfe to this
happy exchange. Hee that made
that beaſt, brings him thither, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens
him there: Euen in ſmall
things there is a great prouidence
what miſteries there are in euery
act of God? The onely ſonne of
God vpon this very hill, is laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the altar of the croſſe; and ſo
becomes a true ſacrifice for the
world, that yet hee is raiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
impeachment, and exempted
from the power of death: The
Lambe of God which takes the
ſinnes of the world is heere really
offered, and accepted: One Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in two figures; in the one, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
reſtored in the other. So <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
whiles hee exerciſes his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:27285:79"/>
faith, confirmes it; and reioyces
more to foreſee the true <hi>Iſaac</hi> in
that place offered to death for his
ſinnes, then to ſee the carnal <hi>Iſaac</hi>
preſerued from death for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of his faith. Whatſoeuer is
deareſt to vs vpon earth is our <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac;</hi>

                     <p>BEfore <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> grewe
riche, they dwelt together;
now their wealth ſeparates them;
Their ſociety was a greater good

a looſer by his wealth; Who
would account thoſe things good
which make vs worſe? It had bin
the duty of yong <hi>Lot</hi> to offer ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

then contend: who would
not heere thinke <hi>Abraham</hi> the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew;
and <hi>Lot</hi> the vncle? It is no
diſparagement for greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

Better doth it beſeeme euery ſon

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:27285:80"/>
to ſway with power. <hi>Abraham</hi>
yeelds ouer this right of his

<hi>Lot</hi> is croſſed in that which hee
choſe, <hi>Abraham</hi> is bleſſed in that
which was left him, God neuer
ſuffers any man to leeſe by an
humble remiſſion of his right in
a deſire of peace.</p>
                     <p>Wealth hath made <hi>Lot</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vndutifull, but couetous, hee
ſees the goodly plains of Iordan,
the richneſſe of the ſoyle, the
commodity of the riuers, the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the cities, and now not
once inquiring into the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the inhabitants, hee is in
loue with Sodome: Outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
are deceitfull guides to
our iudgment, or affections: they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:27285:80"/>
are worthie to bee deceiued that
value things as they ſeeme: It is
not long after that <hi>Lot</hi> paies deere
for his raſhneſſe. He fled for qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe
with his vncle and fiends
warre with ſtrangers: Now is hee
carried priſoner with all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
by great enemies; <hi>Abraham</hi>
muſt reſcue him, of whom hee
was forſaken. That wealth which
was the cauſe of his former quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
is made a pray to mercileſſe
heathens. That place which his
eye couetouſly choſe betraies his
life and goods. How many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
whiles they haue looked at
gaine, haue loſt themſelues?</p>
                     <p>Yet this ill ſucceſſe hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
driuen out <hi>Lot,</hi> nor amended
<hi>Sodome;</hi> he ſtill loues his commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:27285:81"/>
and the Sodomites their ſins
wicked men grow worſe with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
as water grows more
cold after an heate: And as they
leaue not ſinning, ſo God leaues
not plaguing them, but ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
them with ſucceſsion of
iudgements: In how few yeares
hath <hi>Sodome</hi> forgot ſhe was ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and led captiue? If that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
city had beene warned by the
ſword, it had eſcaped the fire; but
now this viſitation had not made
ten good men in thoſe fiue cities:
How fit was this heape for the
fire, which was all chaffe? Onely
<hi>Lot</hi> vexed his righteous ſoul with
the ſight of their vncleanneſſe;
He vexed his owne ſoule, for who
bad him ſtay there? yet becauſe he
was vexed, he is deliuered. He eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:27285:81"/>
their iudgment, for whoſe
ſinnes hee eſcaped. Though hee
would be a gueſt of <hi>Sodome,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee would not entertaine
their ſinnes, hee becomes an hoſt
to the Angels: Euen the good
Angels are the executioners of
Gods iudgement: There cannot
bee a better or more noble act
then to do iuſtice vpon obſtinate
malefactors.</p>
                     <p>Who can be aſhamed of that
which did not miſ-beſeem the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Angels of God? Where ſhould
the Angels lodge but with <hi>Lot,</hi>
the houſes of holy men are full of
theſe heauenly ſpirits, when they
know not, they pitch their tents
in ours, and viſit vs when wee ſee
not, and when we feele not, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:27285:82"/>
vs; It is the honour of Gods
Saints to be attended by Angels:
The filthy Sodomites now flocke
together, ſtirred vp with the fury
of Enuie, and luſt, and dare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
to doe that in troups which
to act ſingle, had beene too abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
to imagine, vnnaturall.
Continuance and ſociety in euill
makes wicked men outragious
and impudent: It is not enough
for <hi>Lot</hi> to be the witneſſe; but hee
muſt bee the baud alſo. (<hi>Bring
forth theſe men that wee may know
them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beholde euen the Sodomites
ſpeake modeſtly; though their
acts and intents bee villanous.
What a ſhame it is for thoſe
which profeſſe impurity of heart,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:27285:82"/>
to ſpeake filthily? The good man
craues and pleades the lawes of
hoſpitality; and when hee ſees
headſtrong purpoſes of miſchiefe
chooſes rather to be an ill father;
then an ill hoſt: His intention was
good, but his offer was faulty; If
through his allowance the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
had defiled his daughters; it
had beene his ſinne; If through
violence they had defiled his
gueſts; it had beene onely theirs:
There can be no warrant for vs to
ſinne, leſt others ſhould ſinne: It
is for God to preuent ſinnes with
iudgement, it is not for men to
preuent a greater ſinne with a
leſſe: the beſt minds when they
are troubled; yeeld inconſiderate
motions, as water that is violently
ſtirred; ſends vp bubbles: God
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:27285:83"/>
meant better to <hi>Lot</hi> then to ſuffer
his weake offer to bee accepted:
Thoſe which are bent vpon villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
are more exaſperated by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion;
as ſome ſtrong ſtreames
when they are reſiſted by flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,
ſwell ouer the bankes.</p>
                     <p>Many a one is hardened by the
good word of God; and in ſteed
of receiuing the counſell, rages at
the meſſenger: When men are
growne to that paſſe, that they
are no whit better by afflictions,
and woorſe with admonitions,
God finds it time to ſtrike; Now
<hi>Lots</hi> gueſts begin to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
Angels, and firſt deliuer
<hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodome,</hi> then from <hi>Sodom:</hi>
Firſt ſtrike them with blindneſſe,
whom they will after conſume
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:27285:83"/>
with fire: How little did the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites
thinke that vengeance
was ſo neere them, while they
went groping in the ſtreets, and
curſing thoſe whom they could
not finde, <hi>Lot</hi> with the Angels is
in ſecure light, and ſees them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
and foreſees them bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
It is the vſe of God to blind
and beſot thoſe whom he means
to deſtroy: The light which they
ſhall ſee ſhall be fiery, which ſhall
be the beginning of an euerlaſting
darkneſſe, and a fire vnquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
Now they haue done ſinning
and God begins to iudge: Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe
hath but a time, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of wickednes is beyond
all time. The reſidue of the night
was both ſhort and dangerous.
Yet good <hi>Lot,</hi> though ſought for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:27285:84"/>
by the Sodomites, and newly
puld into his houſe by the Angels
goes forth of his houſe to ſeek his
ſons in law: No good man would
bee ſaued alone; faith makes vs
charitable with neglect of all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill:
Hee warnes them like a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and aduiſes them like a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but both in vaine, he ſeemes
to them as if he mocked, and they
doe more then ſeeme to mocke
him again. Why ſhould to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
differ from other daies? Who
euer ſaw it raine fire? Or whence
ſhould that brimſtone come? Or
if ſuch ſhowers muſt fall, how
ſhall nothing burne but this val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley?
So to carnall men preaching
is fooliſhneſſe, deuotion idlenes,
the Prophets mad men; <hi>Paul</hi> a
babler: Theſe mens incredulity is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:27285:84"/>
as woorthy of the fire, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
vncleanneſſe. Hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues
not is condemned alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
                     <p>The meſſengers of God do not
onely haſten <hi>Lot,</hi> but pull him
by a gratious violence out of that
impure citie. They thirſted at
once after vengeance vpon <hi>Sodom</hi>
and <hi>Lots</hi> ſafetie; they knew God
could not ſtrike <hi>Sodome,</hi> till <hi>Lot</hi>
were gone out, and that <hi>Lot</hi> could
not be ſafe within thoſe wals. We
are all naturally in <hi>Sodome,</hi> if God
did not hale vs out, whiles we lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
wee ſhould bee condemned
with the world. If God meet with
a very good field, hee puls vp the
weeds, and lets the corne grow,
if indifferent, hee lets the corne
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:27285:85"/>
and weeds grow together; if very
ill, hee gathers the few eares of
corne, and burns the weeds.</p>
                     <p>Oh the large bounty of God
which reacheth not to vs onelie,
but to ours: God ſaues <hi>Lot</hi> for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
ſake, and <hi>Zoar</hi> for <hi>Lots</hi>
ſake; If <hi>Sodome</hi> had not beene too
wicked, it had eſcaped: Were it
not for Gods deere children that
are intermixed with the world it
could not ſtand: The wicked owe
their liues vnto theſe few good;
whom they hate and perſecute.
Now at once the Sunne riſes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Zoar,</hi> and fire falls down vpon
<hi>Sodome: Abraham</hi> ſtands vpon the
hill and ſees the cities burning; It
is faire weather with Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
when it is fouleſt with the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:27285:85"/>
wicked. Thoſe which burned
with the fire of luſt, are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
with the fire of vengeance
They ſinned againſt nature, and
now againſt the courſe of nature;
fire deſcends from Heauen and
conſumes them: <hi>Lot</hi> may not ſo
much as looke at the flame, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the ſtay of his paſſage, or
the horror of the ſight, or triall of
his faith; or feare of commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Small precepts from God are
of importance, obedience is as
well tried, and diſobedience as
wel puniſhed in little, as in much:
His wife doth but turne back her
head, whether in curioſity, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe,
or loue, and compaſsion
of the place; ſhee is turned into a
monument of diſobedience; what
doth it auaile her not to bee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:27285:86"/>
into aſhes in <hi>Sodom,</hi> when ſhe
is turned into a piller of ſalt in the
playne? He that ſaued a whole ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
cannot ſaue his own wife. God
cannot abide ſmal ſinnes, in thoſe
whom he hath obliged. If we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
him, God can as well meet
with vs out of <hi>Sodome: Lot</hi> now
come into <hi>Zoar</hi> maruels at the
ſtay of her, whom hee might not
before looke backe to call; &amp; ſoon
after returning to ſeeke her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
this change with wonder
and griefe: He finds ſalt in ſteede
of fleſh, a piller in ſteed of a wife;
he finds <hi>Sodome</hi> conſumed, and
her ſtanding, and is more amazed
with this, by how much it was
both more neere him, and leſſe
expected.</p>
                     <p>When God deliuers vs from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:27285:86"/>
hee doth not ſecure vs
from all a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>flictions: <hi>Lot</hi> hath loſt
his wife, his allies, his ſubſtance,
and now betakes himſelfe to an
vncomfortable ſolitarineſſe.</p>
                     <p>Yet though he fled from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
he could not flye from ſin:
Hee who could not bee tainted
with vncleanneſſe in <hi>Sodome,</hi> is
ouertaken with drunkenneſſe
and inceſt in a caue: Rather then
Satan ſhal not want baits his own
daughters will proue Sodomites;
Thoſe which ſhould haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
betraied him: How little
are ſome hearts mooued with
iudgements? The aſhes of <hi>Sodome</hi>
and the piller of ſalt were not yet
out of their eye when they dare
thinke of lying with their owne
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:27285:87"/>
Father. They knew that whileſt
<hi>Lot</hi> was ſober hee could not bee
vnchaſt: Drunkenneſſe is the way
to all beſtiall affections, and acts.
Wine knows no difference either
of perſons or ſinnes: No doubt
<hi>Lot</hi> was afterwards aſhamed of
his inceſtuous ſeed, and now wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
hee had come alone out of
<hi>Sodome;</hi> yet euen this vnnaturall
bed was bleſſed with increaſe; and
one of our Sauiours worthy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
ſprung after from this
line. Gods election is not tied to
our meanes; neither are bleſsings
or curſes euer traduced; The chaſt
bedde of holy parents hath oft
times bred a monſtrous generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and contrarily God hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſometimes an holy ſeed from
the drunken bed of inceſt, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:27285:87"/>
It hath beene ſeene that
weighty eares of corne haue
growne, out of the compaſſe of
the tilled field: Thus will God
magnifie the freedom of his
owne choice: and let vs
know that wee are
not borne, but
made good.</p>

was ſo happy as to conceiue none
but a <hi>Iacob;</hi> She muſt be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of both, that ſhee may haue
both ioy and exerciſe. This ſtrife
began early; Euery true Iſraelite
begins his warre with his beeing.
How many actions which wee
know not of, are not without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:27285:93"/>
and ſignification? Theſe two
were the champions of two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the field was their mothers
womb, their quarrell, precedency
and ſuperiority: <hi>Eſau</hi> got the right
of nature; <hi>Iacob</hi> of grace: yet that
there might be ſome pretence of
equality, leſt <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
his brother into the world,
<hi>Iacob</hi> holds him faſt by the heele:
So his hand was borne before the
others foote: But becauſe <hi>Eſau</hi> is
ſome minutes the elder, that the
yonger might haue better claime
to that which God had promiſed
he buyes that, which he could not
winne: If either by ſtrife, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,
or ſuit, we can attaine ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
bleſsings wee are happy: If
<hi>Iaacob</hi> had come forth firſt, he had
not knowne how much hee was
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:27285:93"/>
bound to God for the fauour of
his aduancement. There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any meate except the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fruit ſo deare bought, as this
broth of <hi>Iaacob;</hi> In both, the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
and the eater is accurſed: Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true ſonne of Iſraell will bee
content to purchaſe ſpirituall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
with earthly; And that man
hath in him too much of the
blood of <hi>Eſau,</hi> which will not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dye then forgoe his birth-right.
But what hath careleſſe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi>
loſt, if hauing ſold his birth-right,
he may obtain the bleſsing?
Or what hath <hi>Iaacob</hi> gained, if his
brothers veniſon may counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
his pottage? Yet thus hath
old <hi>Iſaac</hi> decreed; who was now
not more blind in his eyes, then
in his affections: God had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:27285:94"/>
him that the elder ſhould
ſerue the younger, yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> goes
about to bleſſe <hi>Eſau.</hi> It was not ſo
hard for <hi>Abraham</hi> to reconcile
Gods promiſe and <hi>Iſaacs</hi> ſacrifice,
as for <hi>Iſaac</hi> to reconcile the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
of <hi>Iacob,</hi> with <hi>Eſaus</hi> benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
for Gods hand was in that,
in this none but his owne: The
deereſt of Gods ſaints haue beene
ſometimes tranſported with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
affections: He ſaw himſelfe
preferred to <hi>Iſmael,</hi> though the
elder; hee ſaw his father wilfully
forgetting nature at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
in binding him for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
He ſaw <hi>Eſau</hi> lewdly matched
with Heathens; and yet hee will
remember nothing, but <hi>Eſau</hi> is
my firſt borne; But how gracious
is God; that when we would, will
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:27285:94"/>
not let vs ſinne? And ſo orders
our actions, that we do not what
we will, but what we ought; That
God which had ordained the
Lordſhip to the yonger, will alſo
contriue for him the bleſſing;
what he will haue effected, ſhall
not want meanes: the mother
ſhall rather defeate the ſon, and
beguile the Father, then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall beguile the choſen ſon
of his bleſsing: what was <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
to <hi>Rebecca</hi> more then <hi>Eſau?</hi> or
what mother doth not more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the elder? But now God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
the loue of the mother to
the yonger againſt the cuſtom of
nature, becauſe the father loues
the elder, againſt the promiſe:
The affections of the parents are
diuided, that the promiſe might
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:27285:95"/>
bee fulfilled; <hi>Rebeccaes</hi> craft ſhall
anſwer <hi>Iſaacs</hi> partiality: <hi>Iſaac</hi> wold
vniuſtly turne <hi>Eſau</hi> into <hi>Iacob, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca</hi>
doth as cunningly turne <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
into <hi>Eſau:</hi> her deſire was good,
her meanes were vnlawfull; God
doth oft times effect his iuſt will
by our weakeneſſes; yet neither
therby iuſtifying our infirmities;
nor blemiſhing his own actions.
Heere was nothing but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiting
a fained perſon, a fained
name, fained veniſon, a fained an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
&amp; yet behold a true bleſsing
but to the man, not to the means:
Thoſe were ſo vnſound, that <hi>Iacob</hi>
himſelf doth more fear their curſe
then hope for their ſucceſſe: <hi>Iſaac</hi>
was now both ſimple and olde,
yet if he had perceiued the fraud,
<hi>Iacob</hi> had beene more ſure of a
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:27285:95"/>
curſe, then he could be ſure, that
he ſhould not be perceiued; thoſe
which are plaine harted in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
are the bittereſt enemies to
deceipt in others: <hi>Rebecca</hi> preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vpon the Oracle of God,
and her husbands ſimplicity, dare
bee his ſurety for the danger, his
counſeller for the carriage of the
buſines, his cook for the diet, yea
dreſſes both the meate and the
man: and now puts words into
his mouth, the diſh into his hand
the garments vpon his backe, the
goates haire vpon the open parts
of his body, and ſends him in
thus furniſhed for the bleſsing:
Standing no doubt at the dore, to
ſee how well her leſſon was lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
how well her deuiſe ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
And if olde <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould by
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:27285:96"/>
any of his ſenſes haue diſcerned
the guile; ſhe had ſoone ſtept in,
and vndertaken the blame, and
vrged him with that known will
of God concerning <hi>Iacobs</hi> domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and <hi>Eſaus</hi> ſeruitude, which
either age or affection had made
him forget. And now ſhe wiſhes
ſhee could borrow <hi>Eſaus</hi> tongue
as well as his garments, that ſhee
might ſecurely deceiue all the
ſenſes of him, which had ſuffered
himſelfe more dangerouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
with his affection: But this
is paſt her remedy: her ſon muſt
name himſelf <hi>Eſau</hi> with the voice
of <hi>Iacob.</hi> It is hard if our tongue
doe not bewray what we are, in
ſpight of our habit. This was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to worke Iſaac to a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to an inquiry, not to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity:
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:27285:96"/>
He that is good of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
will hardly beleeue euill of
another: And will rather diſtruſt
his owne ſenſes, then the fidelity
of thoſe he truſted: All the ſenſes
are ſet to examine; none ſticketh
at the iudgement but the eare; To
deceiue that, <hi>Iacob</hi> muſt ſecond
his diſſimulation with three lyes
at one breath: I am <hi>Eſau,</hi> as thou
badſt me, my veniſon: one ſin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
fetcheth in another, and
if it be forced to lodge alone, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
departeth, or dyeth: I loue
<hi>Iacobs</hi> bleſsing, but I hate his lye,
I would not doe that wilfully,
which <hi>Iacob</hi> did weakely, vppon
condition of a bleſsing: Hee that
pardoned his infirmity, would
curſe my obſtinateneſſe. Good <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi>
ſets his hands to trie whether
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:27285:97"/>
his eares informed him aright; he
feeles the hands of him whoſe
voice hee ſuſpected: that honeſt
heart could not thinke that the
skin might more eaſily be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaited,
then the lungs: A ſmall
ſatisfaction contents thoſe whom
guiltines hath not made ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous:
<hi>Iſaac</hi> beleeues, and bleſſes
the yoonger ſon in the garments
of the elder: If our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſmell vpon our backes the
ſauor of our elder brothers robes,
wee cannot depart from him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed:
No ſooner is <hi>Iacob</hi> gone
away ful of the ioy of his bleſsing
then <hi>Eſau</hi> comes in, full of the
hope of the bleſsing: And now he
cannot repent him to haue ſolde
that in his hunger for pottage;
which in his pleaſure he ſhal buy
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:27285:97"/>
againe with veniſon: The hopes
of the wicked faile them when
they are at higheſt, whereas Gods
children find thoſe comforts in
extremity which they durſt not
expect. Now hee comes in blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſweating for his reward,
and finds nothing but a repulſe:
Leud men when they think they
haue earned of God; and come
proudly to challenge fauour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
no anſwere but who art
thou? Both the Father and the
Sonne wonder at each other, the
one with feare, the other with
griefe; <hi>Iſaac</hi> trembled, and <hi>Eſau</hi>
wept; the one vpon conſcience,
the other vpon enuye: <hi>Iſaacs</hi> hart
now told him that he ſhould not
haue purpoſed the bleſsing where
he did; and that it was due to him
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:27285:98"/>
vnto whom it was giuen, and not
purpoſed; hence he durſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
that which hee had done,
with Gods will, beſides his own:
For now he ſaw that he had done
vnwilling iuſtice: God will finde
both time and meanes to reclaim
his owne, to preuent their ſins, to
manifeſt and reforme their errors
who would haue looked for tears
from <hi>Eſau?</hi> Or who dare truſt
tears, when he ſees them fal from
ſo graceleſſe eyes? It was a good
word, Bleſſe mee alſo my father;
Euery miſcreant can wiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
well: No man would be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
if it were enough to deſire
happineſſe: Why did he not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
weep to his brother, for the
pottage, then to <hi>Iſaac</hi> for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
If hee had not then ſolde,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:27285:98"/>
hee had not needed now to
begge: It is iuſt with God to
deny vs thoſe fauours which
wee were careleſſe in keeping,
and which wee vnder valew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in inioying; <hi>Eſaus</hi> eares find
no place for <hi>Iſaacs</hi> repentance;
Except it were that he hath done
that by wile, which hee ſhould
haue done vpon duty. No motiue
can cauſe a good heart to repent
that he hath done wel; how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
a thing it is to know the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of grace, and not to neglect
them; how deſperate to haue
known &amp; neglected them, theſe
teares were both late and falſe; the
teares of rage, of enuy, of carnall
deſire; worldly ſorrow cauſeth
death: yet whiles <hi>Eſau</hi> howles out
thus for a bleſsing, I hear him cry
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:27285:99"/>
out of his fathers ſtore (Haſt thou
but one bleſsing my father) of his
brothers ſubtlety (was hee not
rightly called <hi>Iacob?</hi>) I do not hear
him blame his owne deſerts; He
did not ſee, while his Father was
deceiued, and his brother crafty,
that God was iuſt, and himſelfe
vncapable, hee knew himſelfe
prophane, and yet claimes a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
Thoſe that care not to pleaſe
God, yet care for the outward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
of God, and are ready to
murmur if they want them, as if
God were bound to them, and
they free. And yet ſo mercifull is
God, that hee hath ſecond bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
for thoſe that loue him not,
and giues them all they care for.
That one bleſsing of ſpeciall loue
is for none but Iſraell; but thoſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:27285:99"/>
of common kindnes are for them
that can ſell their birth-right:
This bleſsing was more then <hi>Eſau</hi>
could be worthy of, yet like a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Cain,</hi> hee reſolues to kill his
brother, becauſe he was more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
I know not whether hee
were a worſe ſon, or brother; He
hopes for his fathers death, and
purpoſes his brothers; and vowes
to ſhed blood in ſteed of teares.
But wicked men cannot bee ſo ill
as they would; that ſtrong wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
againſt whom <hi>Iacob</hi> preuailed,
preuailed with <hi>Eſau,</hi> and turned
his wounds into kiſſes; an hoſt of
men came with <hi>Eſau;</hi> an army of
Angels met <hi>Iacob, Eſau</hi> threatned,
<hi>Iacob</hi> prayed, His prayers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
haue melted the heart of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi>
into loue. And now in ſteed
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:27285:100"/>
of the grimme and ſterne counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of an executioner, <hi>Iacob</hi>
ſees the face of <hi>Eſau,</hi> as the face of
God. Both men and diuels are
ſtinted, the ſtouteſt heart cannot
ſtand out againſt God, Hee that
can wreſtle earneſtly with God,
is ſecure from the harmes of men.
Thoſe minds which are exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with violence, and cannot
be broken with fear, yet are bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with loue; when the waies of
a man pleaſe God, hee will make
his enemies at peace with him.</p>

                     <p>ISAACS life was not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred
and quiet, then <hi>Iacobs</hi> was
buſie and troubleſom. In the one
I ſee the image of contemplation,
of action in the other. None of
the Patriarchs ſaw ſo euill daies
as he; from whom iuſtly hath the
Church of God therefore taken
her name. Neither were the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
euer ſince called <hi>Abrahamites,</hi>
but Iſraelites: that no time might
be loſt, hee began his ſtrife in the
womb; after that, hee flies for his
life from a cruel brother to a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
vncle. With a ſtaffe goes hee
ouer Iorden alone; doubtfull and
comfortleſſe, not like the ſonne
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:27285:101"/>
of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> In the way the earth is
his bed, and the ſtone his pillow;
Yet euen there he ſees a viſion of
Angels: <hi>Iacobs</hi> heart was neuer ſo
full of ioy, as when his head lay
hardeſt. God is moſt preſent with
vs in our greateſt deiection, and
loues to giue comfort to thoſe
that are forſaken of their hopes.</p>
                     <p>He came farre to finde out an
hard friend; and of a nephew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a ſeruant. No doubt when
<hi>Laban</hi> heard of his ſiſters ſon, hee
looked for the Camels and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
that came to fetch his ſiſter
<hi>Rebecca,</hi> not thinking that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
ſeruant could come better
furniſhed, then <hi>Iſaacs</hi> ſon; but now
when he ſaw nothing but a ſtaffe
he lookes vpon him not as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:27285:101"/>
but a maiſter. And while hee
pretends to offer him a wife as
the reward of his ſeruice, he craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
requires his ſeruice as the
dowry of his wife.</p>
                     <p>After the ſeruice of an hard ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſeſhip
hath earned her
whom he loued; his wife is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and hee is, in a ſort, forced to
an vnwilling adultery: His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had before in a cunning diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
ſubſtituted him, who was
the yonger ſon, for the elder; and
now not long after his father in
law, by a like fraud, ſubſtitutes to
him the elder daughter for the
yonger: God comes oftentimes
home to vs in our own kind; and
euen by the ſinne of others paies
vs our owne, when wee looke
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:27285:102"/>
not for it. It is doubtfull whether
it were a greater croſſe to marry
whom he would not, or to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
of her whom he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And now hee muſt begin a
new hope, where hee made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of fruition; To raiſe vp an
expectation once fruſtrate, is
more difficult, then to continue
a long hope drawn on with like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods
of performance: yet thus
deere is <hi>Iacob</hi> content to pay for
<hi>Rachel,</hi> fourteene yeers ſeruitude:
Commonly Gods children come
not eaſily by their pleaſures: what
miſeries will not loue digeſt and
ouercome? And if <hi>Iacob</hi> were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
conſumed with heat in the

What ſhould wee refuſe to bee

                     <p>
                        <hi>Rachel</hi> whom he loued is barren
<hi>Lea</hi> which was deſpiſed, is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
How wiſely God weighs out
to vs our fauours and croſſes in an

Yet <hi>Lea</hi> would not be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,

her handmaid to make her
a mother; and at laſt beyond
hope, her ſelfe conceiueth: It is a
weake greedineſſe in vs to affect
Gods bleſsings by vnlawfull
meanes; what a proofe and praiſe
had it beene of her faith if ſhee
had ſtaied Gods leaſure, &amp; would
rather haue indured her barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

Now ſhe ſhewes herſelfe the

emulation haue drawn ſinne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Iacobs</hi> bedde: Hee offended in
yeelding, but they more in ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
him, and therefore the fact
is not imputed to <hi>Iacob,</hi> but to
them. In thoſe ſins which Satan
drawes vs into, the blame is ours,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:27285:103"/>
in thoſe which we moue each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnto, the moſt fault and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
lies vpon the tempter.
None of the Patriarchs diuided
his ſeed into ſo many wombs as
<hi>Iacob,</hi> none was ſo much croſſed
in his ſeed.</p>
                     <p>Thus rich in nothing but wiues
and children, was hee now retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to his fathers houſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
his charge, his wealth.
But God meant him yet more
good. <hi>Laban</hi> ſees that both his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie,
and his flockes were wel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſeruice. Not his
loue therefore but his gain makes
him loath to part. Euen <hi>Labans</hi>
couetouſneſſe is made by God
the meanes to inrich <hi>Iacob.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Behold his ſtrait maſter intreats
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:27285:104"/>
him to that recompence, which
made his nephew mighty, and
himſelfe enuious: God conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his hard ſeruice paid him his
wages out of <hi>Labans</hi> folds. Thoſe
flockes and heards had but few
ſpotted ſheep, and goates, vntill
<hi>Iacobs</hi> couenant, then (as if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
had beene altered) they all
ran into parted colours, the moſt
and beſt (as if they had bin weary
of their former owner) changed
the colours of their young, that
they might change their maſter.</p>
                     <p>In the very ſhapes and colours
of bruite creatures there is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
hand, which diſpoſeth them
to his owne ends. Small and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
meanes ſhal preuail where
God intends an effect. Little pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:27285:104"/>
ſtickes of haſell or poplar laid
in the troughs ſhall inrich <hi>Iacob</hi>
with an increaſe of his ſpotted
flockes; <hi>Labans</hi> ſons might haue
tried the ſame meanes, and failed:
God would haue <hi>Laban</hi> know
that hee put a difference betwixt
<hi>Iacob</hi> and him; that as for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeeres hee had multiplied
<hi>Iacobs</hi> charge of cattell to <hi>Laban,</hi> ſo
now for the laſt ſixe yeeres hee
would multiply <hi>Labans</hi> flocke to
<hi>Iacob?</hi> and if <hi>Laban</hi> had the more,
yet the better were <hi>Iacobs:</hi> Euen in
theſe outward things, Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
haue many times ſenſible
taſtes of his fauours aboue the
wicked.</p>
                     <p>I know not whether <hi>Laban</hi> were
a worſe vncle, or father, or maſter
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:27285:105"/>
he can like well <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſeruice, not
his wealth. As the wicked haue
no peace with God, ſo the godly
haue no peace with men; for if
they proſper not, they are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed;
if they proſper, they are
enuyed. This vncle whom his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
had made his Father, muſt
now vpon his wealth be fled from
as an enemie: and like an enemy
purſues him: If <hi>Laban</hi> had meant
to haue taken a peaceable leaue,
hee had neuer ſpent ſeuen daies
iourny in following his innocent
ſonne: <hi>Iacob</hi> knew his churliſhnes
and therefore reſolued rather to
be vnmanerly, then iniuried, well
might hee thinke that hee whoſe
oppreſsion changed his wages ſo
often, in his ſtay would alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
his wages in the parting;
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:27285:105"/>
now therefore hee wiſely prefers
his owne eſtate to <hi>Labans</hi> loue: It is
not good to regard too much the
vniuſt diſcontentment of word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, and to purchaſe vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
fauour with too great
loſſe.</p>
                     <p>Behold <hi>Laban</hi> follows <hi>Iacob</hi> with
one troup, <hi>Eſau</hi> meets him with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
both with hoſtile intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
both go on till the vtmoſt
point of their execution: both are
preuented ere the execution. God
makes fools of the enemies of his
Church, hee lets them proceed
that they may bee fruſtrate, and
when they are gone to the vtmoſt
reach of their tether he puls them
backe to their ſtake with ſhame:
Lo now <hi>Laban</hi> leaues <hi>Iacob</hi> with a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:27285:106"/>
kiſſe; <hi>Eſau</hi> meets him with a kiſſe:
Of the one he hath an oath, tears
of the other, peace with both:
Who ſhall need to feare man that
is in league with God?</p>
                     <p>But what a wonder is this: <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
receiued not ſo much hurt
from all his enemies, as from his
beſt friend. Not one of his haires
periſhed by <hi>Laban,</hi> or <hi>Eſau;</hi> yet he
loſt a ioynt by the Angell, and
was ſent halting to his graue: He
that knows our ſtrength, yet will
wreſtle with vs for our exerciſe;
and loues our violence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
                     <p>Oh happy loſſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> hee
loſt a ioynt and won a bleſsing: It
is a fauour to halt from God, yet
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:27285:106"/>
this fauour is ſeconded with a
greater. He is bleſſed becauſe hee
would rather halt then leaue ere
hee was bleſſed. If hee had left
ſooner, hee had not halted,
but he had not proſpered. That
man ſhall goe away ſound, but
miſerable, that loues a limme
more then a bleſsing. Surely if
<hi>Iacob</hi> had not wreſtled with God,
he had beene foyled with euills:
How many are the troubles of
the righteous.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, <hi>Rachel;</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

but in her trauell, and in his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell

now before digeſted in his
thoughts the ioy and gratulation
of his aged father, for ſo welcome
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:27285:107"/>
a burden. His children, (the ſtaffe

death. <hi>Reuben</hi> proues inceſtuous,

death of his mother, the Fathers
right hand, indangered; himſelfe
driuen by famin, in his old age, to

his ſoule out of all aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
he had beene ſupplanted with

what ſon of Iſraell can hope for

good daies, when hee heares his

                     <p>To execute rigour vpon a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe

Thoſe proud Iews that

may now chooſe whether they
will haue their mother a Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,

things oft-times the birth follows
the belly. His eldeſt ſon <hi>Er,</hi> is too
wicked to liue; God ſtrikes him
dead ere hee can leaue any iſſue,
not abiding any ſience to grow

ſpake to his Church long ere hee

It is no truſting thoſe which
do not wiſh to appeare good. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>

                     <p>Who would not bee aſhamed

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:27285:116"/>
yet did hee ſee the face of her,

                     <p>That ſinne muſt needs bee

There is no paſsion which
doth not for the time bereaue a

not to truſt him without a

he performes the promiſe of the
kid, and ſhe ſtaies not to expect it;
<hi>Iudah</hi> is ſory that hee cannot pay

know them; and wiſhing they

is the eaſieſt wages of ſin, and the
ſureſt, which euer begins firſt in

willing to hide it.</p>
                     <p>I heare as yet of no remorſe in
<hi>Iudah,</hi> but feare of ſhame. Three
moneths hath his ſinne ſlept, and
now when hee is ſecureſt, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes
and baites him. Newes is
brought him that <hi>Thamar</hi> begins
to ſwell with her conception, and
now he ſwels with rage, and cals
her foorth to the flame like a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
iudge, without ſo much as
ſtaying for the time of her deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
that his cruelty in this iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
ſhould bee no leſſe ill, then
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:27285:118"/>
the vniuſtice of occaſioning it. If
<hi>Iuda</hi> had not forgotten his ſinne,
his pitty had beene more then
his hatred to this of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
How eaſie is it to deteſt thoſe
ſinnes in others which we flatter
in our ſelues: <hi>Thamar</hi> doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the ſinne, nor refuſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but cals for that partner in
her puniſhment, which was her
partner in the ſinne: the ſtaffe, the
ſignet, the handkerchiefe accuſe
and conuince <hi>Iuda,</hi> and now hee

God will find a time to bring his

And rather then hee will

hee will make them the trumpets

                     <p>Yet doth hee not offer himſelfe

ſafety: Hee that was enuied for

his deereneſſe, and hated for his

hated for his dreams. Surely God
meant to make the relation of
theſe dreames, a meanes to effect
that which theſe dreames impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Wee men worke by likely
meanes; God by contraries. The
main quarrel was, (<hi>Behold this drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

his dreams; he had not bin ſolde,
if he had not bene ſold, hee had
not bin exalted. So <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſtate had
not deſerued enuie, if his dreams
had not cauſed him to be enuied.
Full little did <hi>Ioſeph</hi> thinke when
he went to ſeek his brethren that
this was the laſt time hee ſhould
ſee his Fathers houſe: Full little
did his brethren think when they
ſolde him naked to the Iſmaelites
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:27285:121"/>
to haue once ſeene him in the

                     <p>In an honeſt and obedient ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> comes to inquire of
his brethrens health, and now
may not returne to carry newes
of his owne miſery: whiles hee
thinks of their welfare they are
plotting his deſtruction. (<hi>Come let

expected this cruelty in them
which ſhould bee the Fathers of
Gods Church: It was thought a
fauour that <hi>Reubens</hi> intreaty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for him that hee might be

He lookt for brethren, and behold
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:27285:121"/>
murtherers; Euery mans tongue,
euery mans fiſt was bent againſt
him: Each one ſtriues who ſhall
lay the firſt hand vppon that
changeable cote, which was died
with their Fathers loue, and their
enuie: And now they haue ſtript
him naked, and haling him by
both armes, as it were: caſt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue

of forbearance, they reſolue to
torment him with a lingring

for now beſides (what in them

                     <p>All this while <hi>Ioſeph</hi> wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

crying naked in that deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

with the noyſe of his lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:27285:122"/>
not once thinking by their owne

                     <p>Whatſoeuer they thought, God
neuer meant that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſhould

ſends very Iſmaelites to raunſome
him from his brethren; the ſeed of
him that perſecuted his brother
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſhal now redeem <hi>Ioſeph</hi> from
his brethrens perſecution: When
they came to fetch him out of the
pit, hee now hoped for a ſpeedy
diſpatch; That ſince they ſeemed
not to haue ſo much mercy as to
prolong his life, they would not
continue ſo much cruelty as to
prolong his death.</p>
                     <p>And now when he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:27285:123"/>
himſelfe with hope of the
fauour of dying, behold death ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed

common to all; that, to none but
the miſerable: <hi>Iudah</hi> meant this
well, but God better: <hi>Reuben</hi> ſaued
him from the ſword; <hi>Iudah</hi> from
affamiſhing: God will euer raiſe

malicious: How well was this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
beſtowed? If <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had died

Little did they thinke that they

                     <p>One ſinne is commonly vſed

whiles they ſhould hide their

                     <p>Hee that is mourned for in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan

his owne ſeruice is his leaſt good;
for his very preſence procures a

<hi>Ioſeph:</hi> Vertue is not lookt vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

him, his maiſter truſts him, his

All the ſpight of his brethren was

Temptations on the right

But the heart that is bent vppon

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:27285:124"/>
and indifferently betwixt the

                     </p>
                     <p>He knew that all the honours

And to ſuffer his miſtreſſe to

                     <p>This ſecond time is <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſtript

his maiſter: for behold, the pledge
of his fidelity which hee left in

euidence againſt him of that
which he refuſed to doe: therfore
did hee leaue his cloake becauſe
he would not doe that; of which
he is accuſed and condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he left it: what ſafety is there

The walls of that dungeon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

                     <p>Neither doth his profeſsion

His tenne ſonnes muſt now leaue
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:27285:129"/>
their flockes, and goe down into

And now they go to buy of
him whom they had folde; and
bow the knees to him for his life,
which had bowed to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for his owne life. His age, his
habit; the place, the language
kept <hi>Ioſeph</hi> from their knowledge;
neither had they called off their

But hee can not but know

go the neereſt way to trueth. It is
more ſafe in caſes of inquiſition
to fetch far about, that he might

                     <p>It was no ſmall ioy to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> to
ſee this late accompliſhment of
his ancient dreame; to ſee theſe
ſuppliants (I know not whether
more brethren, or enemies)
groueling before him in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing
ſubmiſsion: And now it
doth him good to ſeeme merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
to them, whom he had found
wilfully cruell; to hide his loue
from them which had ſhewed
their hate to him, and to thinke
how much he fauourd them, and
how little they knew it: And as
ſporting himſelfe in their ſeeming
miſery, he pleaſantly imitates all
thoſe actions reciprocally vnto
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:27285:130"/>
them, which they in deſpight and
earneſt, had done formerly to
him; hee ſpeakes roughly, reiects
their perſwaſions, puts them in
hold, and one of them in bonds.
The minde muſt not alwaies bee
iudged by the outward face of
the actions. Gods countenance is
oft-times as ſeuere, and his hand
as heauy to them whom hee beſt
loueth. Many a one vnder the
habit of an Egyptian hath the
hart of an Iſraelite. No ſong could
be ſo delightful to him, as to hear
them in a late remorſe condemn
themſelues before him, of their
old cruelty towards him, who

mention of this euill which they
had done againſt him, and pities
them with teares, hee weeps for
ioy to ſee their repentance, and to
compare his ſafety and happines
with the cruelty which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and did, and thought
they had done.</p>
                     <p>Yet he can abide to ſee his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his priſoner; whom no bonds
could bind ſo ſtrong, as his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
bound him to his captiue:
<hi>Simeon</hi> is left in pawne, infetters;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:27285:131"/>
the reſt returne, with their corne,
with their mony, paying nothing
for their prouiſion; but their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
that they might be as much
troubled with the benificence of
that ſtrange Egyptian Lord, as
before with his imperious ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Their wealth was now more
irkeſom to them, then their need,
and they feare God means to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them more in this ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of money, then in the want of
victuals. (<hi>What is this that God hath
done to vs?</hi>) It is a wiſe courſe to
be iealous of our gaine; and more
to feare, then deſire abundance.</p>
                     <p>Old <hi>Iacob</hi> that was not vſed to
ſimple and abſolut contentments
receiues the bleſsing of ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
prouiſion, together with the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:27285:132"/>
affliction of that heauy meſſage;
the loſſe of one ſonne, and the
danger of another. And knowes
not whether it be better for him
to die with hunger, or with griefe
for the departure of that ſonne of
his right hand: Hee driues off till
the laſt; Protraction is a kinde of
eaſe in euils that muſt come.</p>
                     <p>At length (as no plea is impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
as that of famine) <hi>Beniamin</hi>
muſt goe; one euill muſt bee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded
for the redreſſe of another
what would it auaile him to ſee
whom he loued, miſerable? how
iniurious were that affliction to
keepe his ſonne ſo long in his eye
till they ſhould ſee each other die
for hunger.</p>
                     <p>The ten brothers returne into
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:27285:132"/>
Egypt loaded with double mony
in their ſackes, and a preſent in
their hands; the danger of miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
is requited, by honeſt minds
with more then reſtitution. It is
not enough to find our own harts
clear in ſuſpicious actions, except
we ſatisfie others: Now hath <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
what he would, the ſight and
preſence of his <hi>Beniamin,</hi> whom
he therefore borrowes of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a time, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
him with a greater intereſt
of ioy: And now hee feaſts them
whom hee formerly threatned,
and turnes their feare into won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
all vnequall loue is not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
all the brethren are intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
bountifully, but <hi>Beniamin</hi>
hath a fiue-fold portion: By how
much his welcome was greater,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:27285:133"/>
by ſo much his pretended theft
ſeemed more hainous, for good
turnes aggrauate vnkindneſſes,
and our offences are increaſed
with our obligations: How eaſie
is it to finde aduantages, where
there is a purpoſe to accuſe: <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi>
ſacke makes him guilty of
that whereof his heart was free:
Crimes ſeeme ſtrange to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent;
well might they abiure
this fact with the offer of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
and death: For they which
carefully brought againe that
which they might haue taken,
would neuer take that which was
not giuen them. But thus <hi>Ioſeph</hi>
would yet dally with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and make <hi>Beniamin</hi> a theefe
that he might make him a ſeruant
and fright his brethren with the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:27285:133"/>
perill of that their charge, that he
might double their ioy, and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedneſſe
in giuing them two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
at once: our happineſſe is
greater, and ſweeter when wee
haue well feared, and ſmarted
with euills.</p>
                     <p>But now when <hi>Iudah</hi> ſeriouſly
reported the danger of his old fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the ſadneſſe of his laſt
complaint, compaſsion and ioy
will be concealed no longer; but
breake forth violently at his voice
and eies. Many paſſions doe not
well abide witneſſes, becauſe they
are guilty to their owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſends foorth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
that he might freely weep.
He knew he could not ſay, I am
<hi>Ioſeph,</hi> without an vnbeleeuing
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:27285:134"/>
vehemence.</p>
                     <p>Neuer any worde ſounded ſo
ſtrangely as this, in the eares of
the Patriarkes. Wonder, doubt,
reuerence, ioy, feare, hope, guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſtroke them at once. It was
time for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to ſay Feare not;
No maruell if they ſtood with
paleneſſe and ſilence before him;
looking on him, and on each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
the more they conſidered,
they wondred, and the more they
beleeued, the more they feared:
For thoſe words (<hi>I am Ioſeph,</hi>) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to ſound thus much to their
guilty thoughts: You are murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and I am a Prince in ſpight of
you; My power and this place,
giue me all opportunities of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge;
My glory is your ſhame,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:27285:134"/>
my life your danger, your ſinne
liues together with mee. But now
the teares and gratious words of
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> haue ſoone aſſured them of
pardon and loue, and haue bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
them turne their eies from
their ſinne againſt their brother,
to their happineſſe in him, and
haue changed their doubts into
hopes and ioyes; cauſing them
to looke vppon him without
feare, though not without ſhame.
His louing imbracements cleare
their hearts of all iealouſies; and
haſten to put new thoughts into
them; of fauour, and of greatnes:
So that now forgetting what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
they did to their brother, they
are thinking of what good their
brother may doe to them: Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſalued vp with a free forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:27285:135"/>
are as not done; and as a
bone once broken is ſtronger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
well ſetting, ſo is loue after
reconcilement.</p>
                     <p>But as wounds once healed
leaue a ſcarre behind them; ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
iniuries leaue commonly
in the actors a guilty remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;
which hindred theſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
from that freedom of ioy
which elſe they had conceiued:
This was their fault, not <hi>Ioſephs;</hi>
who ſtriues to giue them all ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his loue, and will bee as
bountifull, as they were cruell.
They ſent him naked to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
he ſends them in new and
rich liueryes to their Father; they
tooke a ſmall ſumme of money
for him, he giues them great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:27285:135"/>
They ſent his torne cote to
his Father; Hee ſends variety of
coſtly raiments to his Father by
them: They ſold him to bee the
load of camels; Hee ſends them
home with chariots. It muſt be a
great fauor that can appeaſe the
conſcience of a great iniury. Now
they returne home rich and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
making themſelues happy to
thinke, how glad they ſhould
make their father with this news.</p>
                     <p>That good old man would
neuer haue hoped that Egypt
could haue affoorded ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
as this. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is yet aliue:
This was not food, but life to
him. The returne of <hi>Beniamin</hi>
was comfortable: but that his
dead ſonne was yet aliue after ſo
many yeeres lamentation, was ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:27285:136"/>
too happy to bee beleeued,
and was enough to endanger
that life with exceſſe of ioy, which
the knowledge thereof doubled.
Ouer-excellent obiects are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
in their ſudden apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
One graine of that ioy
would haue ſafely cheared him,
whereof a full meaſure ouer-laies
his heart with too much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
There is no earthly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
whereof wee may not ſurfet:
of the ſpirituall wee can neuer
haue enough.</p>
                     <p>Yet his eies reuiue his minde,
which his eares had thus aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
When he ſaw the charets
of his ſonne, hee beloeued <hi>Ioſephs</hi>
life, and refreſhed his owne. He
had too much before, ſo that hee
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:27285:136"/>
could not enioy it: now he ſaith,
<hi>I haue enough, Ioſeph my ſonne is yet
aliue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They told him of his honour,
he ſpeakes of his life: life is better
than honour. To haue heard
that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> liued a ſeruant, would
haue ioied him more, than to
heare that hee died honourably.
The greater bleſſing obſcures the
leſſe. Hee is not worthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that is not thankfull for life.</p>
                     <p>Yet <hi>Ioſephs</hi> life did not content
<hi>Iacob</hi> without his preſence: (<hi>I will
go downe and ſee him ere I dye:</hi>) The
ſight of the eye is better then to
walke in deſires; Good things ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
vs not in their being, but in
our inioying.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:27285:137"/>
The height of all earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
appeared in the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of theſe two; whom their
mutuall loſſe had more endeared
to each other: The intermiſsion
of comforts hath this aduantage,
that it ſweetens our delight more
in the returne, then was abated in
the forbearance. God doth oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
hide away our <hi>Ioſeph</hi> for a
time that wee may bee more ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and thankfull in his recouery:
This was the ſincereſt pleaſure
that euer <hi>Iacob</hi> had, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God reſerued for his age.</p>
                     <p>And if the meeting of earthly
friends be ſo vnſpeakeably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable;
how happy ſhall we bee
in the ſight of the glorious face
of God our heauenly Father; of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:27285:137"/>
that our bleſſed redeemer, whom
we ſold to death by our ſins, and
which now after that noble Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
hath all power giuen him
in heauen and in earth:</p>
                     <p>Thus did <hi>Iacob</hi> reioyce when he
was to go out of the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to a forreine nation for <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi>
ſake; being glad that hee
ſhould looſe his country for his
ſonne. What ſhall our ioy bee,
who muſt out of this forraine
land of our pilgrimage to the
home of our glorious inheritance,
to dwell with none but our own;
in that better and more lightſome
Goſhen-free from all the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
of this Egypt, and full of
al the riches and delights of God?
The guilty conſcience can neuer
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:27285:138"/>
thinke it ſelfe ſafe: So many yeares
experience of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> loue could
not ſecure his brethren of remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
thoſe that know they haue
deſerued ill, are wont to miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
fauours, and think they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be beloued: All that while, his
goodnes ſeemed but concealed,
and ſleeping malice; which they
feared in their Fathers laſt ſleepe
would awake and bewray it ſelfe
in reuenge: Still therefore they
plead the name of their Father,
though dead, not daring to vſe
their owne: Good meanings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be more wronged, then with
ſuſpicion: It grieues <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to ſee
their feare, and to find they had
not forgotten their owne ſinne,
and to heare them ſo paſsionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
craue that which they had.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="261" facs="tcp:27285:138"/>
                        <hi>Forgiue the treſpaſſe of the ſeruants
of thy Fathers God:</hi>) What a coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of pardon was this? What
wound could be either ſo deepe,
or ſo feſtered, as this plaſter could
not cure? They ſay not, the ſons
of thy Father, for they knew <hi>Iacob</hi>
was dead, and they had degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but the ſeruants of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
God: How much ſtronger
are the bonds of religion, then of
nature: If <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had beene ranco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
this deprecation had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
him; but now it reſolues him
into teares: They are not ſo ready
to acknowledge their old offence
as he to proteſt his loue; and if he
chide them for any thing, it is for
that they thought they needed
to intreat ſince they might know,
it could not ſtand with the fellow
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:27285:139"/>
ſeruant of their Fathers God to
harbour maliciouſneſſe, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
reuenge. Am not I vnder
God? And fully to ſecure them; he
turnes their eyes from themſelues
to the decree of God, from the
action to the euent; as one that
would haue them thinke, there
was no cauſe to repent of that
which proued ſo ſuccesfull.</p>

All that I can ſay for my

Therefore ſhould he haue made
much of the Iſraelites, that they
might bee his, his fauours might

might they not as wel draw their

                     <p>Weake and baſe minds euer
incline to the worſe; and ſeeke
ſafety rather in an impoſsibility
of hurt, then in the likelihood of
iuſt aduantage: Fauors had bene
more binding then cruelties, yet
the fooliſh Egyptian had rather
haue impotent ſeruants, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
friends. For their welfare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> owes Iſrael a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe;
and how will he pay it?</p>
                     <p>(<hi>Come let vs worke wiſely;</hi>) Leud

                     <p>Iniuſtice is vpheld by violence,
whereas iuſt gouernments are

muſt be ſet ouer Iſrael; they
ſhould not be the true ſeed of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
if they were not ſtill ſet to
wreſtle with God in afflictions:
Heauy burdens muſt be laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them: Iſrael is neuer but loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the deſtiny of one of <hi>Iacobs</hi>
ſonnes is common to all. To lye
downe betwixt their burdens: If
they had ſeemed to breath them
in Goſhen ſometimes, yet euen
there it was no ſmall miſery to
be forrainers, and to liue among
Idolaters: But now the name of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:27285:145"/>
a ſlaue is added to the name of a
ſtranger. Iſrael had gathered
ſome ruſt in idolatrous Egypt,
and now he muſt be ſcoured, they
had born the burden of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
if they had not born the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
of the Egyptians.</p>
                     <p>As God afflicted them with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
mind then the Egyptians;
(God to exerciſe them, the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
to ſuppreſſe them;) ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
hee the euent to differ. Who
would not haue thought with
theſe Egyptians, that ſo extreme
miſery ſhould not haue made the
Iſraelites vnfit both for generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and reſiſtance; Moderate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
ſtrengthens, extreame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes
nature: That God which
many times workes by contrarie
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:27285:146"/>
means cauſed them to grow with
depreſsion, with perſecution to
multiply; How can Gods Church
but fare well, ſince the very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of their enemies benefits
them. O the Soueraigne goodnes
of our God that turnes all our
poyſons into cordials, Gods vine
beares the better with bleeding.</p>
                     <p>And now the Egyptians could
be angry with their owne malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
that this was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of multiplying them whom
they hated, and feared; to ſee that
this ſeruice gained more to the
workmen, then to their maiſters;
The ſtronger therefore the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
grew, the more impotent
grew them alice of their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.
And ſince their owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:27285:146"/>
ſtrengthens them, now ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
will try what can bee done
by the violence of others: Since
the preſent ſtrength cannot bee
ſubdued; the hopes of ſucceſsion
muſt be preuented: women muſt
bee ſuborned to bee murtherers,
and thoſe whoſe office is to help
the birth, muſt deſtroy it.</p>
                     <p>There was leſſe ſuſpition of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
in that ſexe, and more opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of doing miſchiefe. The
male children muſt be borne, and
dye at once; what can bee more
innocent then the child that hath
not liued ſo much as to cry, or to
ſee light? It is fault enough to bee
the ſon of an Iſraelite: the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
may liue for bondage, for luſt
a condition ſo much (at the leaſt)
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:27285:147"/>
woorſe then death, as their ſexe
was weaker. O maruellous cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that a man ſhould kill a man,
for his ſexes ſake. Whoſoeuer
hath looſed the reynes vnto cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
is eaſily carryed into incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
extremities.</p>
                     <p>From burdens they proceed to
bondage, and from bondange to
blood: from an vniuſt vexation of
their body, to an inhumane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the fruit of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
As the ſins of the concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part, from ſleight motions
grow on to foule executions, ſo
doe thoſe of the iraſcible; there is
no ſinne whoſe harbour is more
vnſafe then of that of malice: But
oft times the power of tyrants
anſwers not their will; euill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:27285:147"/>
cannot alwaies meete
with equally miſchieuous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</p>
                     <p>The feare of God teaches the
mid wiues to diſobey an vniuſt
command; they well knew how
no excuſe it is for euill, I was bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
God ſaid to their harts, <hi>Thou
ſhalt not kill,</hi> This voice was louder
then <hi>Pharaohs.</hi> I commend their
obedience in diſobeying, I dare
not commend their excuſe, there
was as much weakeneſſe in their
anſwere, as ſtrength in their
practiſe: as they feared God in
not killing, ſo they feared <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh</hi>
in diſſembling: oft times thoſe
that make conſcience of greater
ſins are ouertaken with leſſe. It is
wel and rare if we can come forth
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:27285:148"/>
of a dangerous action without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſoyle; and if we haue eſcaped
the ſtorme; that ſome after drops
wet vs not.</p>
                     <p>Who would not haue expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that the midwiues ſhould
bee murthered for not murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring?
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> could not be ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to thinke theſe women truſty
yet his indignation had no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to reach to their puniſhment
God proſpered the mid-wiues:
who can harme them? Euen the
not dooing of euill is rewarded
with good. And why did they
proſper? Becauſe they feared
God; Not for their diſsimulation
but their pietie. So did God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
their mercie, that he ragar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not their infirmitie. How
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:27285:148"/>
fondly do men lay the thank vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſin which is due to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
true wiſedome teaches to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
Gods actions, and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
them to the right cauſes:
Pardon belongs to the lye of the
Midwiues, remuneration to their
goodnes, proſperity to their fear
of God.</p>
                     <p>But that which the Midwiues
will not, the multitudes ſhall do;
It were ſtrange if wicked rulers
ſhould not finde ſome or other
inſtruments of violence: all the
people muſt drowne whom the
women ſaued; Cruelty hath but
ſmoked before, now it flames vp;
ſecret practiſing hath made it
ſhameleſſe, that now it dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
tyranny. It is a miſerable
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:27285:149"/>
ſtate where euery man is made
an executioner: there can bee no
greater argument of an ill cauſe
then a bloody proſecution, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
truth vpholds herſelfe by mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and is promoted by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
This is their act, what was
their iſſue? the people muſt drown
their males, themſelues are drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
they died by the ſame means
by which they cauſed the poore
Iſraelitiſh infants to dye; that law
of retaliation which God will not
allow to vs, becauſe we are fellow
creatures, hee iuſtly practiſeth in
vs. God would haue vs reade our
ſinnes in our iudgements, that we
might both repent of our ſinnes;
and giue glory to his iuſtice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pharaoh</hi> raged before, much
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:27285:149"/>
more now that hee receiued a
meſſage of diſmiſsion: the moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of God make ill men worſe:
the waues doe not beat nor roare
any where ſo much as at the
banke which reſtraines them.
Corruption when it is checked,
growes madde with rage. As the
vapour in a cloud would not
make that fearefull report, if it
met not with oppoſition. A good
heart yeelds at the ſtilleſt voice of
God: but the moſt gratious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of God harden the wicked.
Many would not be ſo deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſettled in their ſinnes, if the
word had not controlled them.
How milde a meſſage was this to
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and yet how galling?
<hi>Wee pray thee let vs goe.</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
him that which hee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:27285:150"/>
Hee tooke pleaſure in the
preſent ſeruitude of Iſrael: God
cals for a releaſe. If the ſuit had
beene for mitigation of labour,
for preſeruation of their children,
it might haue caried ſome hope,
and haue found ſome fauour, but
now God requires that which he
knows will as much diſcontent
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> cruelty could
diſcontent the Iſraelites (<hi>Let vs
goe</hi>) How contrary are Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
to naturall minds? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
as they loue to croſſe him
in their practiſe; ſo hee loues to
croſſe them in their commands
before, &amp; his puniſhments after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
It is a dangerous ſigne of
an ill heart to feele Gods yoake
heauy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> talkes of ſacrifice, <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh</hi>
                        <pb n="285" facs="tcp:27285:150"/>
talkes of worke. Any thing

<hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes of deuotion,
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> of idleneſſe. It hath beene
an old vſe, as to caſt faire colours

ſame Diuell that ſpoke in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
ſpeakes ſtill in our ſcoffers, and
cals religion hypocriſie, conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
care, ſingularitie. Euery
vice hath a title, and euery vertue
a diſgrace.</p>
                     <p>Yet while poſſible taskes were
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:27285:151"/>
impoſed, there was ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
Their diligence might ſaue
their backes from ſtripes. The
conceit of a benefit to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
and hope of impunitie
to the labourer, might giue a
good pretence to great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
but to require taskes not fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
is tyrannicall, and doth
onely picke a quarrell to puniſh.
They could neither make ſtraw,
nor finde it, yet they muſt haue
it. Doe what may be, is tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
but doe what cannot bee, is
cruell. Thoſe which are aboue
others in place, muſt meaſure
their commands, not by their
owne wils, but by the ſtrength of
their inferiors. To require more
of a beaſt than he can doe, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane.
The taske is not done:
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:27285:151"/>
the taske-maſters are beaten:
the puniſhment lies where the
charge is; they muſt exact it of
the people, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of them. It
is the miſerie of thoſe which are
truſted with authoritie, that their
inferiours faults are beaten vpon
their backes. This was not the
fault to require it of the taske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters,
but to require it by the
taske-maſters, of the people.
Publike perſons doe either good

Perhaps we would haue thought

the danger of a ſinne, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid

No doubt when <hi>Iochebed</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther

borne of her, and him beautifull
and comely, ſhe ſell into extreme
paſſion, to thinke that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners

Mid-wiues. All the time of her
conception, ſhee could not but
feare a ſonne; now ſhee ſees him,

more grieuous than her firſt. The
paines of trauell in others are

ſomewhat mitigated with hope,
and counteruailed with ioy that a

                     <p>Many times God writes preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

reſolution which can follow God

of the euent: When ſhee can no

And now ſhe ſees her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

                     <p>No tyrannie can forbid her to

pitie beſeeme great perſonages?
and moſt in extremities. It had
beene death to another to reſcue

it was ſafe and noble. It is an
happie thing when great ones
improue their places to ſo much
more charitie as their libertie is
more.</p>

compaſſionate, offers to

glad hands receiues her childe,
both with authority and reward.
She would haue giuen al her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
for the life of her ſonne;
and now ſhee hath a reward to
nurſe him. The exchange of the
name of a mother for the name
of a nurſe hath gained her both
her ſonne, and his education, and
with both, a recompence. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth not call vs to a weake
ſimplicity, but allows vs as much
of the ſerpent, as of the Doue:
Lawfull policies haue from God

                     <p>The good Ladie did not breed

him as ſome childe of almes, or as
ſome wretched outcaſt for whom
it might be fauor enough to liue;
but as her owne ſonne. In all the
delicacies, in all the learning of
Egypt. Whatſoeuer the Court, or
the Schoole could put into him,
he wanted not; yet all this could
not make him forget that he was
and Hebrew. Education workes
wondrous changes, and is of great
force either way, a little aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath ſo puffed vp ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
themſelues, that they haue
not only forgot their friends, but
ſcorned their parents. All the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of Egypt could not winne
<hi>Moſes</hi> not to call his nurſe, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
or weane him from a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
miſerie with the Iſraelites.
If we had <hi>Moſes</hi> his faith, we could
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:27285:156"/>
not but make his choice. It is
onely our infidelity that bindes
vs ſo faſt to the world, and makes
vs preferre the momentany plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of ſinne, vnto that euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
recompence of reward.</p>
                     <p>Hee went foorth and looked
on the burdens of Iſrael. What
needed <hi>Moſes</hi> to haue afflicted
himſelfe with the afflictions of
others? Himſelfe was at eaſe and
pleaſure in the Court of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
A good heart cannot abide to be
happy alone; and muſt needes,
vnbidden, ſhare with others in
their miſeries. He is no true <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
that is not mooued with the
calamities of Gods Church. To
ſee an Egyptian ſmite an Hebrew,
it ſmote him, and mooued him
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:27285:157"/>
to ſmite. Hee hath no Iſraelitiſh
blood in him, that can endure
to ſee an Iſraelite ſtriken either
with hand or tongue.</p>
                     <p>Heere was his zeale: where
was his authoritie? Doubtleſſe
<hi>Moſes</hi> had an inſtinct from God
of his magiſtracie; elſe how
ſhould hee thinke they would
haue vnderſtood what himſelfe
did not? Oppreſſions may not
bee righted by violence, but by
law. The redreſſe of euill by a
perſon vnwarranted, is euill. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
knew that God had called
him, he knew that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> knew
it not: therefore he hides the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian
in the ſand. Thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which may bee approoued
vnto God, are not alwaies ſafe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:27285:157"/>
with men: as contrarily, too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things goe currant with men,
that are not approoued of God.</p>
                     <p>Another Hebrew is ſtrucken,
but by an Hebrew: the act is the
ſame, the agents differ: neither
doth their profeſſion more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
than <hi>Moſes</hi> his proceedings.
Hee giues blowes to the one: to
the other, words. The blowes
to the Egyptian were deadly; the
words to the Hebrew, gentle and
plauſible. As God makes a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt chaſtiſements of
his owne, and puniſhments of
ſtrange children: So muſt wiſe
gouernours learne to diſtinguiſh
of ſinnes and iudgements, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to circumſtances. How
mildly doth <hi>Moſes</hi> admoniſh?
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:27285:158"/>
Sirs, yee are brethren. If there
had beene but any dramme of
good nature in theſe Hebrewes,
they had relented: now it is
ſtrange to ſee that being ſo vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally
vexed with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
aduerſarie, they ſhould yet
vex one another: One would
haue thought that a common
oppoſition ſhould haue vnited
them more, yet now priuate
grudges doe thus dangerouſly
diuide them. Blowes enow were
not dealt by the Egyptians, their
owne muſt adde to the violence.
Still Satan is thus buſie, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
are thus malicious, that (as
if they wanted enemies) they flie
in one anothers faces. While we
are in this Egypt of the world, all
vnkinde ſtrifes would eaſily bee
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:27285:158"/>
compoſed if wee did not forget
that wee are brethren.</p>
                     <p>Behold an Egyptian in the
skinne of an Hebrew: How dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
an anſwer doth <hi>Moſes</hi> receiue
to ſo gentle a reproofe? Who
would not haue expected that
this Hebrew had beene enough
deiected with the common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction?
But vexations may make
ſome more miſerable, not more
humble. As wee ſee ſickeneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
make ſome tractable, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more froward; It is no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
matter to beare a reproofe
well; if neuer ſo well tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
no ſugar can bereaue a pill
of his bitterneſſe: None but the
gracious can ſay, <hi>Let the righteous
ſmite me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:27285:159"/>
Next to the not deſeruing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
is the well taking of it. But
who is ſo ready to except and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
as the wrong-doer? The
patient replies not. One iniurie
drawes on another, firſt to his
brother, then to his reproouer.
Guiltineſſe will make a man ſtirre
vpon euery touch: hee that was
wronged, could incline to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation:
Malice makes men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of good counſell; and
there are none ſo great enemies
to iuſtice, as thoſe which are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to peace.</p>
                     <p>With what impatience doth a
galled heart receiue an admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
This vnworthy Iſraelite is
the patterne of a ſtomackfull of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
firſt he is moued to chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:27285:159"/>
in himſelf: then he cals for the
authoritie of the admoniſher: A
ſmal authoritie will ſerue for a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
admonition. It is the duty of
men, much more of Chriſtians to
aduiſe againſt ſinne; yet this man
askes who made thee a Iudge, for
but finding fault with his iniury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Then, hee aggrauates, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrues;
Wilt thou kill mee?
when <hi>Moſes</hi> meant onely to ſaue
both. It was the death of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
onely that was intended and
the ſafety of his perſon. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he vpbraids with former acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
Thou killedſt the Egyptian:
What if he did? What if vniuſtly?
What was this to the Hebrew?
Another mans ſinne is no excuſe
for ours: A wicked heart neuer
lookes inward to it ſelfe, but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:27285:160"/>
to the quality of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
if that affoord exception, it is
enough. As a dog runs firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
on the ſtone: what matter
is it to me who he be that admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
me: let me look home into
my ſelf: let me look to his aduiſe.
If that be good, it is more ſhame
to me to be reprooued by an euill
man. As a good mans allowance
cannot warrant euill, ſo an euill
mans reproofe may remedy euill:
If this Hebrew had bin well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<hi>Moſes</hi> had not heard of his
ſlaughter; Now in choller all will
out; And if this mans tongue had
not thus caſt him in the teeth
with blood, he had beene ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ere he could haue
known that the fact was known.</p>
                     <p>Now he growes iealous, flees
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:27285:160"/>
and eſcapes No friend is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
in ſome eaſes as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary;
This wound which the
Hebrew thought to giue <hi>Moſes,</hi>
ſaued his life. As it is good for a
man to haue an enemy, ſo it ſhall
be our wiſedome to make vſe of
his moſt cholericke obiections.
The woorſt of an enemy, may
prooue moſt ſoueraigne to our
ſelues. <hi>Moſes</hi> flees, It is no diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
for a man to flee when his
conſcience purſues him not:
Where Gods warrant will not
protect vs, it is good for the
heeels to ſupply the place of the
tongue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> when he may not in Egipt,
he will be doing iuſtice in Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
In Egypt hee deliuers the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:27285:161"/>
Iſraelite. In Midian the
wronged daughters of <hi>Iethro.</hi> A
good man will be doing good,
whereſoeuer he is; His trade is a
compound of charity and iuſtice
as therfore euill diſpoſitions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee changed with ayres, no
more will good. Now then hee
ſits him downe by a well in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.
There hee might haue to
drinke, but where to eat he knew
not. The caſe was altered with
<hi>Moſes,</hi> to come from the dainties
of the court of Egypt, to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the fields of Midian: It is a
leſſon that al Gods children muſt
learne to take out, to want and to
abound. Who can thinke ſtrange
of penury, when the great gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Gods people once hath
nothing? Who would not haue
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:27285:161"/>
thought in this caſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould
haue bene hartleſſe and ſullen; ſo
caſt downe with his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
that he ſhould haue had
no feeling of others; yet how
hote is hee vpon iuſtice? No ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie
can make a good man
neglect good duties, hee ſees the
oppreſsion of the ſhepheards,
the image of that other hee left
behind him in Egypt: The maids,
(daughters of ſo great a peere)
draw water for their flockes, the
inhumane ſhepherds driue them
away; rudeneſſe hath no reſpect
either to ſexe, or condition; If we
liued not vnder lawes this were
our caſe; Might would bee the
meaſure of iuſtice: we ſhould not
ſo much as enioy our owne wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
vniuſt courſes will not euer
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:27285:162"/>
proſper: <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall rather come
from Egypt to Midian to beate
the ſhepheards, then they ſhall
vexe the daughters of <hi>Iethro:</hi> This
act of iuſtice was not better done
than taken. <hi>Reuel</hi> requites it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with an hoſpitall entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
A good nature is ready to
anſwer courteſies: we cannot do
too much for a thankfull man.
And if a courteous heathen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the watering of a ſheepe in
this bountifull manner, how ſhal
our God recompence but a cup
of cold water, that is giuen to a
diſciple? This ſauor hath wonne
<hi>Moſes,</hi> who now conſents to dwel
with him, though out of the
Church. Curioſitie or whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
idle occaſions may not draw
vs (for our reſidence) out of the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:27285:162"/>
bounds of the Church of God:
danger of life may; wee loue not
the Church if wee eaſily leaue it:
if in a caſe of life, we leaue it not
(vpon opportunitie) for a time of
reſpite, wee loue not our ſelues.
The worſt part of <hi>Moſes</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall
was his wife, one of thoſe
whom he had formerly prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                     <p>I doe not ſo much maruell
that <hi>Iethro</hi> gaue him his daughter
(for he ſaw him valiant, wiſe, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
nobly bred) as that <hi>Moſes</hi>
would take her; a ſtranger, both
in blood and religion. I could
plead for him neceſſitie: his own
nation was ſhut vp to him; if hee
would haue tried to fetch a
daughter of Iſrael, he had endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:27285:163"/>
to leaue himſelfe behinde.
I could pleade ſome correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in common principles of
religion; for doubtleſſe <hi>Moſes</hi> his
zeale could not ſuffer him to
ſmother the truth in himſelfe: he
ſhould haue beene an vnfaithfull
ſeruant, if hee had not beene his
maſters teacher. Yet neither of
theſe can make this match either
ſafe, or good. The euent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraies
it dangerouſly inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
This choice had like to haue
coſt him deare: ſhee ſtood in his
way for circumciſion; God ſtands
in his way for reuenge. Though
he was now in Gods meſſage, yet
might he not be for borne in this
neglect. No circumſtance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the deareneſſe of the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or our owne ingagement,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:27285:163"/>
can beare out a ſinne with God:
Thoſe which are vnequally yo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
may not euer looke to draw
one way. True loue to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
cannot long agree with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of the religion. He had need
to be more than a man, that hath
a <hi>Zipporah</hi> in his boſome, and
would haue true zeale in his hart.
All this while <hi>Moſes</hi> his affection
was not ſo tied to Midian, that he
could forget Egypt. Hee was a
ſtranger in Midian: what was he
elſe in Egypt? Surely either E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
was not his home, or a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
one; and yet in reference
to it, he cals his ſonne <hi>Gerſhom,</hi> a
ſtranger there. Much better was
it to bee a ſtranger there, than a
dweller in Egypt. How hardly
can we forget the place of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:27285:164"/>
or education, although ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo homely? And if hee ſo
thought of his Egyptian home,
where was nothing but bondage
and tyrannie, how ſhould wee
thinke of that home of ours,
aboue, where is nothing but
reſt and bleſſedneſſe?</p>

So hee might haue the

full opportunity of holy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

                     <p>Whiles he is tending his ſheep,

                     <p>When I looke vpon this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
buſh with <hi>Moſes,</hi> me thinks
I can neuer ſee a woorthier, and
more liuely Embleme of the

how oft hath it bene flaming, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
conſumed. The ſame power
that enlightens it, preſerues it:
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:27285:166"/>
and to none but his enemies is he
a conſuming fire; <hi>Moſes</hi> was a
great Philoſopher, but ſmall skill
would haue ſerued to know the
nature of fire, and of the buſh:
that fire meeting with combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
matter could not but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume:
If it had beene ſome ſolid woood
it would haue yeelded later to the
flame; but buſhes are of ſo quick
diſpatch, that the ioy of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is compared to a fire of thorns.
Hee noted it a while, ſaw it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
&amp; began to wonder. It was
ſome maruel how it ſhould come
there; but how it ſhould continue
without ſupply, yea without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution

admirable: Doubtleſſe hee went

mind could meete with no likely
cauſes, ſo farre off, reſolues, I
will go ſee it; His curioſity ledde
him neerer, and what could hee
ſee but a buſh and a flame which
hee ſaw at firſt vnſatisfied? It is
good to come to the place of

may perhaps ſpeake to thy heart,
though thou come but for nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Euen thoſe which haue come

Abſence is without hope; If

                     <p>To ſee a fire not conſuming

a ſpeaking fire, this was more; and
to heare his own name out of the

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:27285:167"/>
all. God makes way for his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

and admiration: as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
careleſnes carries vs to a more
proficiency vnder the beſt means

more effectuall to vs.</p>
                     <p>In that appearance God meant

We muſt come to God, wee
muſt not come too neere him,
when wee meditate of the great
myſteries of his word, wee come
to him: wee come too neere him
when we ſearch into his counſels.
The Sunne and the fire ſay of
themſelues, Come not too neere,
how much more the light which
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:27285:167"/>

Court, not into the Temple: the
Prieſts and Leuites into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
not into the Holy of Holies;
<hi>Moſes</hi> to the hill, not to the buſh.
The waues of the ſea had not
more need of bounds, than mans
preſumption. <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt not
come cloſe to the buſh at all; and
where he may ſtand, he may not
ſtand with his ſhooes on. There

heereafter we ſhall ſee
him in this very mount betwixt
heauen and earth, in thunder,
lightning, ſmoke, earth-quakes,
ſpeaking mouth to mouth with
God, bare faced, and feareleſſe:
God was then more terrible, but
<hi>Moſes</hi> was leſſe ſtrange. This was
his firſt meeting with God; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
acquaintance makes him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar,
and familiarity makes him
bold: Frequence of conuerſation
giues vs freedome of acceſſe to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:27285:170"/>
God; and makes vs poure out
our hearts to him as fully and as
feareleſly as to our friends. In the
meane time now at firſt he made
not ſo much haſte to ſee, but hee
made as much to hide his eies:
Twice did <hi>Moſes</hi> hide his face;
once for the glory which God
put vpon him, which made him
ſo ſhine, that hee could not bee
beheld of others; once for Gods
owne glory, which he could not
behold. No maruell. Some of
the creatures are too glorious for
mortall eies: how much more
when God appeares to vs in the
eaſieſt manner, muſt his glorie
needs ouercome vs? Behold the
difference betwixt our preſent,
and future eſtate: Then, the more
maieſtie of appearance, the more
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:27285:171"/>
delight: when our ſinne is quite
gone, all our feare at Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
ſhall be turned into ioy.
God appeared to <hi>Adam</hi> before his
ſinne with comfort, but in the
ſame forme which after his ſinne
was terrible. And if <hi>Moſes</hi> cannot
abide to looke vpon Gods glory
when he deſcends to vs in mercy,
how ſhall wicked ones abide to
ſee his fearefull preſence when
he ſets vpon vengeance. In this
fire hee flamed and conſumed
not, but in his reuenge our God
is a conſuming fire.</p>
                     <p>Firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> hides himſelfe in
feare, now in modeſtie. Who
am I? None in all Egypt or Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
was comparably fit for this
embaſſage. Which of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:27285:171"/>
had beene brought vp a
Courtier, a ſcholar, an Iſraelite
by blood, by education an Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
learned, wiſe, valiant, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced?
Yet, Who am I? The
more fit any man is for whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vocation, the leſſe he thinkes
himſelfe. Forwardneſſe argues
inſufficiencie. The vnworthie
thinkes ſtill, Who am I not? Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
beginnings giue hopefull
proceedings, and happy endings.
Once before, <hi>Moſes</hi> had taken
vpon him, and laid about him;
hoping then they would haue
knowen that by his hand God
meant to deliuer Iſrael: but now
when it comes to the point, Who
am I? Gods beſt ſeruants are not
euer in an equall diſpoſition to
good duties. If wee finde diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:27285:172"/>
in our ſelues ſometimes,
it argues that grace is not our
owne. It is our frailtie, that
thoſe ſeruices which wee are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to, aloofe off, wee ſhrinke
at, neere hand, and fearefully
miſſe-giue. How many of vs
can bid defiances to death, and
ſuggeſt anſwers to abſent tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which when they come
home to vs, wee flie off, and
change our note, and inſtead of
action, expoſtulate?</p>

                     <head>The plagues of Egypt.</head>
                     <p>IT is too much honour for fleſh
and blood to receiue a meſſage
from heauen, yet here God ſends
a meſſage to man, and is repulſed:
well may God aske, who is man
that I ſhould regard him, but for
man to aske who is the Lorde, is
a bolde and proud blaſphemy.
Thus wilde is nature at the firſt;
but ere God haue done with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
he will be knowne of him, he
will make himſelfe knowne by
him, to all the world: God might
haue ſwept him away ſuddenly.
How vnworthy is he of life, who
with the ſame breath that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:27285:173"/>
denies the giuer of it: But
he would haue him conuinced,
ere he were puniſhed; Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee workes miracles before
him, then vpon him. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was
now from a ſtaffe of protection
and ſuſtentation to Gods people,
turned to a ſerpent that ſtung
them to death; God ſhewes him
himſelfe in this reall embleme;
doing that ſuddenly before him,
which Satan had wrought in him
by leaſure; And now when hee
crawles and winds, and hiſſes,
threatning perill to Iſrael, hee
ſhewes him how in an inſtant, he
can turne him into a ſenceleſſe
ſticke, and make him if not vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet feareleſſe: The ſame God
which wrought this, giues Satan
leaue to imitate it; the firſt plague
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:27285:173"/>
that he ment to inflict vpon <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
is deluſion: God can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the Diuell ſhould win him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
credit, where hee meanes to
iudge, and holds the honour of a
miracle well loſt, to harden an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
Yet to ſhow that his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
was of power, the others of
permiſsion; <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſerpent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
theirs; how eaſily might
the Egyptians haue thought, that
he which cauſed their ſerpent not
to be, could haue kept it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that they which could
not keepe their Serpent from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring,
could not ſecure them
from being conſumed; but wiſe
thoughts enter not into thoſe
that muſt periſh. All Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſtand ready, and waite but
till they be called for. They need
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:27285:174"/>
but a watch-word to bee giuen
them: No ſooner is the rodde lift
vp, but they are gone forth into
the world, preſently the waters
runne into bloud, the frogs and
lice craule about, and al the other
troupes of God come ruſhing in
vpon his aduerſaries: All crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
conſpire to reuenge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries
of God. If the Egyptians
looke vpward, there they haue
thunder, lightning, hayle, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts,
one while no light at all, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
while ſuch fearfull flaſhes
as had more terror, then darknes.
If they looke vnder them, there
they ſee their waters changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
blood, their earth ſwarming
with frogs and graſſehoppers: If
about them, one while the flyes
fill both their eyes and eares, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:27285:174"/>
while they ſee their fruites
deſtroyed, their cattell dying,
their children dead. If laſtly they
looke vpon themſelues, they ſee
themſelues loathſome with lice,
painful and deformed with ſcabs,
biles and botches.</p>
                     <p>Firſt God begins his iudgement
with the waters. As the riuer of
Nilus was to Egypt in ſteed of
heauen to moiſten and fatten the
earth; ſo their confidence was
more in it then in heauen; Men
are ſure to bee puniſht moſt and
ſooneſt, in that which they make
a corriuall with God. They had
before defiled the riuers with the
bloud of innocents; and now it
appeares to them, in his owne
colour. The waters will no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:27285:175"/>
keepe their counſell: Neuer
any man delighted in blood,
which had not enough of it, ere
his end: they ſhed but ſome few
ſtreames, and now behold whole
riuers of blood: Neither was this
more a monument of their
ſlaughter, paſt, then an image of
their future deſtruction. They
were afterwards ouerwhelmed
in the redde ſea, and now before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
they ſee their riuers redde
with blood. How dependant
and ſeruile is the life of man, that
cannot either want one element,
or endure it corrupted; It is hard
to ſay whether there were more
horrour, or annoyance in this
plague. They complain of thirſt,
and yet doubt whether they
ſhould dye, or quench it with
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:27285:175"/>
bloud. Their fiſh (the chiefe part
of their ſuſtenance) dyes with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and infecteth more by
being dead. The ſtench of both
is ready to poyſon the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants;
yet <hi>Pharaohs</hi> curioſity car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
him away quite from the
ſenſe of the iudgement, hee had
rather ſend for his magicians to
worke feats, then to humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
vnder God for the remooual
of this plague; And God plagues
his curioſity with deceipt, thoſe
whom he truſts, ſhall vndoe him
with preuailing; the glory of a
ſecond miracle ſhall be obſcured
by a falſe imitation, for a greater
glory to God in the ſequell.</p>
                     <p>The rod is lift vp againe, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
that Nilus which they had
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:27285:176"/>
before adored, was neuer ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
as it is now troubleſome;
yeelding them not onely a dead,
but a liuing annoyance: It neuer
did ſo ſtore them with fiſh, as
now it plagues them with frogs;
Whatſoeuer any man makes his
God, beſides the true one, ſhall
bee once his tormenter. Thoſe
loathſome creatures leaue their
owne element to puniſh them,
which rebelliouſly detained Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
from their owne. No bed, no
table can be free from them, their
dainty Ladies cannot keep them
out of their boſomes; neither can
the Egyptians ſooner open their
mouthes, than they are ready to
creepe into their throats; as if
they would tell them that they
came on purpoſe to reuenge the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:27285:176"/>
wrongs of their maker: yet euen
this wonder alſo is Satan allowed
to imitate. Who can maruell to
ſee the beſt vertues counterfeited
by wicked men, when hee ſees
the diuell emulating the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
power of God? The feates
that Satan plaies may harden, but
cannot benefit. Hee that hath
leaue to bring frogs, hath neither
leaue, nor power, to take them
away, nor to take away the
ſtench from them. To bring
them, was but to adde to the
iudgement; to remooue them,
was an act of mercy. God doth
commonly vſe Satan in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of iudgement, neuer in the
workes of mercie to men.</p>
                     <p>Yet euen by thus much is <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
                        <pb n="338" facs="tcp:27285:177"/>
hardned, and the ſorcerers
growen inſolent. When the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
and his agents are in the
height of their pride, GOD
ſhames them in a trifle. The rod
is lift vp: the very duſt receiues
life: lice abound euery where,
and make no difference betwixt
beggers and Princes. Though
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Courtiers abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſee themſelues louzie, yet
they hoped this miracle would
be more eaſily imitable: but now
the greater poſſibilitie, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
foile. How are the great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-mongers
of Egypt abaſhed
that they can neither make lice
of their owne, nor deliuer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
from the lice that are
made. Thoſe that could make
ſerpents and frogs, could not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:27285:177"/>
make or kill lice; to ſhew
them that thoſe frogs and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
were not their owne work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip.
Now <hi>Pharaoh</hi> muſt
needs ſee how impotent a diuell
hee ſerued, that could not make
that vermine which euery day ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
voluntarily out of corruption.
<hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> cannot now
make thoſe lice (ſo much as by
deluſion) which at another time
they cannot chuſe but produce
vnknowing, and which now
they cannot auoid. That ſpirit
which is powerfull to execute
the greateſt things when hee is
bidden, is vnable to doe the leaſt
when he is reſtrained. Now theſe
corriuals of <hi>Moſes</hi> can ſay, <hi>This is
the finger of God.</hi> Yee fooliſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters,
was Gods finger in the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:27285:178"/>
lice, not in the frogs, not in the
blood, not in the ſerpent? And
why was it rather in the leſſe,
than in the greater? Becauſe yee
did imitate the other, not theſe.
As if the ſame finger of God had
not beene before in your imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was now in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint:
As if yee could haue fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in theſe, if yee had not beene
only permitted the other. Whiles
wicked mindes haue their full
ſcope, they neuer looke vp aboue
themſelues; but when once God
croſſes them in their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
their want of ſucceſſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
them to giue God his owne.
All theſe plagues perhaps had
more horror than paine in them.
The frogges creepe vpon their
clothes, the lice vpon their skins,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:27285:178"/>
but thoſe ſtinging hornets which
ſucceed them, ſhall wound and
kill. The water was annoied
with the firſt plague, the earth
with the ſecond and third; this
fourth fils the aire, and beſides
corruption brings ſmart. And
that they may ſee this winged ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
comes out from an angrie
God, (not either from nature, or
chance) euen the very flies ſhall
make a difference betwixt Egypt,
and Goſhen. He that gaue them
their being, ſets them their ſtint.
They can no more ſting an Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,
than fauour an Egyptian.
The very wings of flies are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by a prouidence, and doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their limits. Now
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> findes how impoſſible it
is for him to ſtand out with God,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:27285:179"/>
ſince all his power cannot reſcue
him from lice and flies.</p>
                     <p>And now his heart begins to
thaw a little: Goe, doe ſacrifice to
your God in this land; or (ſince
that will not be accepted) Go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the wilderneſſe, but not far: but
how ſoone it knits againe! Good
thoughts make but a thorow-fare
of carnall hearts, they can
neuer ſettle there: yea his very
miſſe-giuing hardens him the
more: that now neither the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
of his cattle, nor the botches
of his ſeruants can ſtirre him a
whit. Hee ſaw his cattle ſtrucke
dead with a ſudden contagion;
he ſaw his ſorcerers (after their
conteſtation with Gods meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers)
ſtrucke with a ſcabbe in
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:27285:179"/>
their very faces, and yet his heart
is not ſtrucke. Who would think
it poſſible that any ſoule could
bee ſecure in the midſt of ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie,
and frequence of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
Theſe very plagues haue
not more wonder in them, than
their ſucceſſe hath. To what an
height of obduration will ſinne
leade a man, and of all ſinnes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity?
Amidſt all theſe ſtorms
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſleepeth, till the voice of
Gods mightie thunders, and haile
mixed with fire rouzed him vp a
little.</p>
                     <p>Now as betwixt ſleeping and
waking, hee ſtarts vp, and ſaies,
<hi>God is righteous, I am wicked, Moſes
pray for vs,</hi> and preſently laies
downe his head againe. God hath
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:27285:180"/>
no ſooner done thundring, than
hee hath done fearing. All this
while you neuer finde him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to preuent any one euill, but
deſirous ſtill to ſhift it off when
he feeles it; neuer holds conſtant
to any good motion; neuer
praies for himſelfe, but careleſly
willes <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to pray for
him; neuer yeelds God his whole
demand, but higgleth and dodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
like ſome hard chapman,
that would get a releaſe with the
cheapeſt: Firſt, they ſhall not go;
then, goe and ſacrifice, but in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;
next, goe ſacrifice in the
wilderneſſe, but not farre off;
after, goe ye that are men; then,
goe you and your children only;
at laſt, goe all ſaue your ſheepe
and cattle. Whereſoeuer meere
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:27285:180"/>
nature is, ſhe is ſtill improuident
of future good, ſenſible of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
euill, inconſtant in good
purpoſes, vnable, through vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and vnwilling to
ſpeake for her ſelfe, niggardly in
her grants, and vncheerfull. The
plague of the graſhoppers ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him a little; and the more,
through the importunitie of his
ſeruants: for when he conſidered
the fiſh deſtroied with the firſt
blow, the cattle with the fifth,
the corne with the ſeuenth, the
fruit and leaues with this eighth,
and nothing now left him but a
bare fruitleſſe earth to liue vpon,
and that, couered ouer with lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts,
neceſſitie droue him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for an aduantage: <hi>Forgiue mee
this once; take from me this death only.</hi>
                        <pb n="346" facs="tcp:27285:181"/>
But as conſtrained repentance
is euer ſhort and vnſound; the
Weſt winde together with the
graſhoppers blowes away his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe;
and now is hee ready for
another iudgement. As the graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers
tooke away the ſight of
the earth from him, ſo now a
groſſe darkneſſe takes away the
ſight of heauen too: other dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
were but priuatiue, this
was reall and ſenſible. The Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
thought this night long,
(how could they chuſe, when it
was ſix in one?) and ſo much the
more, for that no man could riſe
to talke with other, but was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
confined to his owne
thoughts: One thinkes, the fault
in his owne eies, which hee rubs
often times in vaine: Others
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:27285:181"/>
thinke that the Sunne is loſt out
of the firmament, and is now
with-drawen for euer: Others,
that all things are returning to
their firſt confuſion: All thinke
themſelues miſerable paſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and wiſh (whatſoeuer had
befallen them) that they might
haue had but light enough to ſee
themſelues die.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Pharaoh</hi> prooues like to
ſome beaſts that grow mad with
baiting: grace often reſiſted turns
to deſperateneſſe; <hi>Get thee from
mee, looke thou ſee my face no more;
whenſoeuer thou commeſt in my ſight,
thou ſhalt die.</hi> As if <hi>Moſes</hi> could
not plague him as well in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:
As if hee that could not
take away the lice, flies, frogges,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:27285:182"/>
graſhoppers, could at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
take away the life of <hi>Moſes</hi>
that procured them. What is
this but to run vpon the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and runne away from the
remedies? Euermore, when Gods
meſſengers are abandoned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
is neere. <hi>Moſes</hi> will ſee
him no more till he ſee him dead
vpon the ſands; but God will
now viſit him more than euer:
The fearefulleſt plagues God ſtill
reſerues for the vpſhot: All the
former doe but make way for the
laſt. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> may exclude <hi>Moſes</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi> but Gods Angell hee
cannot exclude: Inſenſible meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
are vſed, when the viſible
are debarred.</p>
                     <p>Now God beginnes to call for
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:27285:182"/>
the blood they owned him: In
one night euery houſe hath a
carcaſe in it and (which is more
grieuous) of their firſt borne,
and (which is yet more fearefull)
in an inſtant. No man could
comfort other; euery man was
too full of his owne ſorrow, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
rather to make the noiſe of
the lamentation more dolefull,
and aſtoniſhing. How ſoone
hath God changed the note of
this tyrannicall people! Egypt
was neuer ſo ſtubborne in deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſſage to Iſrael, as now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
to intreat it: <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
did not more force them to ſtay
before, than now to depart:
whom lately they would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
now they hire to go. Their
rich iewels of ſiluer and gold
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:27285:183"/>
were not too deare for them
whom they hated; how much
rather had they to ſend them
away wealthy, than to haue
them ſtay to bee their executors?
Their loue to themſelues obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of them the inriching of
their enemies; and now they are
glad to pay them well for their
old worke, and their preſent
iourney: Gods people had ſtaid
like ſlaues, they goe away like
conquerours, with the ſpoile of
thoſe that hated them: armed
for ſecuritie, and wealthie for
maintenance.</p>
                     <p>Old <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſeuenty ſouls which
he brought downe into Egypt in
ſpight of their bondage &amp; blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
goe foorth ſix hundred
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:27285:183"/>
thouſand men, beſides children.
The world is well mended with
<hi>Iſrael</hi> ſince he went with his ſtaffe
and ſcrippe ouer Iordan. Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
is too weake, where God bids
Increaſe and multiplie. I know
not where elſe the good hearbe
ouer-growes the weedes; the
Church out-ſtrips the world. I
feare if they had liued in eaſe and
delicacie, they had not beene ſo
ſtrong, ſo numerous. Neuer any
true Iſraelite loſt by his affliction.
Not only for the action, but the
time, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> choice meets with
Gods. That very night, when
the 130. yeeres were expired, Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
is gone, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> neither can,
nor can will to keepe them lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
yet in this, not fulfilling
Gods will, but his owne. How
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:27285:184"/>
ſweetly doth God diſpoſe of all
ſecond cauſes, that whiles they
doe their owne will, they do his?</p>
                     <p>The Iſraelites are equally glad
of this haſte: who would not be
ready to goe, yea to flie out of
bondage? They haue what
they wiſhed; it was no ſtaying
for a ſecond inuitation. The
loſſe of an opportunitie is many
times vnrecouerable: The loue
of their libertie made the burden
of their dough light: who knew
whether the variable minde of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> might returne to a deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and (after all his ſtubborne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe)
repent of his obedience?
It is fooliſh to hazard where there
is certaintie of good offers, and
vncertainetie of continuance.

They goe therfore; and the ſame
God that fetcht them out, is both
their guide and protector. How
carefully doth hee chuſe their
way? not the neerer, but the ſafer.
He would not haue his people ſo
ſuddenly change from bondage
to warre.</p>
                     <p>It is the wondrous mercy of
God that he hath reſpect, as to his
owne glory, ſo to our infirmities.
He intends them wars heereafter,
but after ſome longer breathing,
and more preparation; his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
ſo orders all, that euils are not
ready for vs, till wee be ready for
them. And as hee chuſes, ſo hee
guides their way. That they
might not erre in that ſandy and
vntracked wilderneſſe, himſelfe
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:27285:185"/>
goes before them: who could but
follow cheerefully when hee ſees
God leade him? He that lead the
wiſe men by a ſtarre, leads Iſrael
by a cloud: That was an higher
obiect, therefore hee giues them
an higher and more heauenly
conduct: This was more earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
therefore he contents himſelfe
with a lower repreſentation of
his preſence. A piller of cloud
and fire: A piller, for firmneſſe;
of cloud and fire, for viſibilitie
and vſe. The greater light extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes
the leſſe, therefore in the
day he ſhewes them not fire, but
a cloud: In the night nothing is
ſeene without light; therefore
he ſhewes them not the cloud,
but fire: The cloud ſhelters them
from heat by day; the fire digeſts
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:27285:185"/>
the rawneſſe of the night. The
ſame God is both a cloud and a
fire to his children, euer putting
himſelfe into thoſe formes of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
reſpects, that may beſt fit
their neceſſities.</p>
                     <p>As good motions are long ere
they can enter into hard hearts,
ſo they ſeldome continue long.
No ſooner were the backes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
turned to depart, than <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs</hi>
heart and face is turned after
them, to fetch them backe againe.
It vexes him to ſee ſo great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
ſo much wealth caſt away
in one night; which now he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolues
to redeeme, though with
more plagues. The ſame ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and couetouſneſſe that made
him weare out ſo many iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:27285:186"/>
will not leaue him, till it
haue wrought out his full deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
All Gods vengeances
haue their end, the finall perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his enemies, which they
cannot reſt till they haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> therefore and his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
will needs go fetch their
bane. They well knew that Iſrael
was fitter to ſerue than to fight;
weary with their ſeruitude, not
trained vp to warre, not furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with prouiſion for a field:
Themſelues captaines and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
by profeſſion, furniſhed
with horſes, and chariots of war.
They gaue themſelues therefore
the victory beforehand, and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
either for ſpoile or bondage:
yea the weake Iſraelites gaue vp
themſelues for dead, and already
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:27285:186"/>
are talking of their graues. They
ſee the ſea before them; behinde
them, the Egyptians: they know
not whether is more mercileſſe,
and are ſtrucken with the feare of
both. O God, how couldeſt
thou forbeare ſo diſtruſtfull a
people! They had ſeene all thy
wonders in Egypt, and in their
Goſhen; they ſaw euen now thy
piller before them, and yet they
did more feare Egypt than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
thee. Thy patience is no
leſſe miracle than thy deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
But in ſtead of remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
from them, the cloudy pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
remooues behinde them, and
ſtands betwixt the Iſraelites and
Egyptians: as if God would haue
ſaid, They ſhall firſt ouercome
mee, O Iſrael, ere they touch
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:27285:187"/>
thee. Wonder did now iuſtly
ſtriue with feare in the Iſraelites,
when they ſaw the cloud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
behinde them, and the
ſea remooue before them. They
were not vſed to ſuch bulwarkes.
God ſtood behinde them in the
cloud; the ſea reared them vp
walles on both ſides them. That
which they feared would be their
deſtruction, protected them:
how eaſily can God make the
cruelleſt of his creatures both our
friends and patrons?</p>
                     <p>Yet heere was faith mixed with
vnbeleefe. Hee was a bold Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite
that ſet the firſt foot into the
channell of the ſea: and euery
ſteppe that they ſet in that moiſt
way, was a new exerciſe of their
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:27285:187"/>
faith. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſees all this, and
wonders; yet hath not the wit
or grace to thinke (though the
piller tels him ſo much) that God
made a difference betwixt him,
and Iſrael. Hee is offended with
the ſea, for giuing way to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and yet ſees not why hee
may not truſt it as well as they.
Hee might well haue thought
that hee which gaue light in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhen,
when there was darkneſſe
in Egypt, could as well diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
in the ſea: but hee cannot
now either conſider, or feare: It
is his time to periſh. God makes
him faire way, and lets him run
ſmoothly on till hee be come to
the midſt of the ſea; not one
waue may riſe vp againſt him to
wet ſo much as the hoofe of his
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:27285:188"/>
horſe. Extraordinary fauours to
wicked men are the fore-runners
of their ruine.</p>
                     <p>Now when God ſees the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
too farre to returne, he
findes time to ſtrike them with
their laſt terrour: they know not
why, but they would returne
too late. Thoſe Chariots in
which they truſted, now faile
them, as hauing done ſeruice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to carry them into perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
God purſues them, and
they cannot flie from him. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men make equall haſte both
to ſinne, and from iudgement:
but they ſhall one day finde that
it is not more eaſie to runne into
ſinne, than impoſſible to runne
away from iudgement: the ſea
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:27285:188"/>
will ſhew them, that it regards
the rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> not the ſcepter
of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and now (as gladde
to haue got the enemies of God
at ſuch an aduantage) ſhuts her
mouth vpon them, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
them vp in her waues, and
after ſhee hath made ſport with
them a while, caſts them vp on
her ſands, for a ſpectacle of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
to their aduerſaries.</p>
                     <p>What a ſight was this to the
Iſraelites, when they were now
ſafe on the ſhore to ſee their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
come floating after them
vpon the billowes, and to finde
among the carcaſes vpon the
ſands, their knowen oppreſſors,
which now they can tread vpon
with inſultation. They did not
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:27285:189"/>
crie more loud before, than now
they ſing. Not their faith, but
their ſenſe teaches them now to
magnifie that God after their
deliuerance, whom they
hardly truſted for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance.</p>
