            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note>For euery morning do the men of law march to the Hall, as it were to the fielde: The Counsellore are the Leaders, Atturnies and Clarkes, are petty Commaunders, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the band: the trayned old Weather-beaten Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, are those that haue followed the Law a long time, and haue vndoone themselues by brabblinges. The raw, fresh-water-Souldiers, are such as entered but yesterday into the action.</p>
            <p>In which March of theirs, if you fall but in amongst the Rankes, you will by and by suppose your selfe in the Low-Countries; for as the Souldiers (there) so these (here) talk of nothing but Stratagems and poyntes of War. Some threaten to ouerthrow their aduersaries, vpon assaults and Battryes: Some (as if an enemy were to be blown vp in a Towne) sweare to driue them out of their houses by way of <hi>Eiectments:</hi> Others, as if they came to the sacking of a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cry out vpon nothing but <hi>Attachments,</hi> both of goodes and body.</p>
            <p>And as among Soaldiers, some delight in bloud more then others, so amongst these, some take a pryde in cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie more then others, and labour onely to haue their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in <hi>Execution.</hi> At the length, they come into the fielde, (that is to say, to the <hi>Barre</hi>) where they must trie the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell by Arbiterment of wordes in stead of swords: for there either the one side or other is ouerthrown: There stand the Pikemen (that is to say, such as haue had long sutes) and being wearyed,<note place="margin">

And thus (thou Minion of so many Kinges) doth this stirring vp and downe of my body, stirre vppe my bloud, and kéepes mee sound: this peopling of my stréets, makes me to be crowned with the title, dignity, and liberties of a Cittie, (for what are Citties if they be not peopled:) this Phisick (so long as I take it) preserues my body in health: But because I am compelled sometimes to giue it ouer, (which is commonly

               </note> and now a little at the beginning of the fall of the lease, (for this part of the yeare doth most trouble mee) I féele the state of my body weake, and subiect to infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For alasse there are certaine Canker-Wormes (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Uacations) that destroy the Trées of my Inhabitants, so soone as euer they beare any fruite. These Uacations are to mine owne body, like long and wasting consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are more grieuous to my remembrance, then the comming on of a tedious night to a man tormented with sicknes: or then marriages delaied, to them that lie sighing for the delights thereof.</p>
            <p>The vnwholesome breath of Autumne, who is so full of diseases, that his very blowing vppon trées, makes theyr leaus to fal off (as the French Razor shaues off the haire of many of thy <hi>Suburbians,</hi>) euen that, and all the foure Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-windes that kéepe such a blustring in the world, do not more scatter the dust of the Earth, then the cold blastes of foure Uacations, doe blow abroad the wealth that before I haue gotten together.</p>
            <p>In the Tearme times euery day to me is a day of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, but euery Uacation starues me with ill dyet, for all the daies of them are to me nothing but fasting daies. Yea, the Dog-dayes are not halfe so vnwholesome, so pestilent &amp; so perilous to the bodyes of men, as those are to mee. The Tearmes are my flowings, the Uacations my ebbinges. So that (if I were sure the world would not hold mee for a miserable and couetous wretch) I could euen wish, that these battayles of the law, were fighting all the yeare long. It were as much glory, fame, and preferment for mee to haue it so, as it is for the Low countries, to be all the year vp in armes.</p>
            <p>And tell me I pray, (thou prouident Mistris ouer so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny families) tell mee in thine opinion, if it were not fit to haue all these foure Riuers of the law, run into one stream, without any stoppings or turnings. For, do but consider what voyage a man is to make when he sayes, <hi>I must goe

But if they bee troubled by brablings and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly mindes, and be put from their owne smooth and euen by as, then doe they plague the world with stormes: Then doth Thunder shake the Rich mans building, lightning burnes vp the poore mans Corne, Haile-stones beat down the fruites of the earth, and all Creatures that are within reach of their fury, tremble, and hide their heads at the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p>The very phrase of <hi>Going to Law,</hi> shewes the greatnes, Maiesty, and state of Law: for the Law comes to no man,

but he is eyther driuen, or else so busie of himselfe, that he goes to it. The Law sléepes continually, vnlesse shee bee wakened by the wronges of men oppressed, or by the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulency of those that will not let her rest: for the first sort of which people, she hath a payre of <hi>Balance,</hi> wherein shee wieghes their Innocence, and the Iniuries of others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing one to make good the hurts of the other.
