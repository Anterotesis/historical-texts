            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>rfore we ought not to leaue these their assemblies, though the open wicked and many other enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be there committed and suffered.</p>
               <p>First (as hath beene noted) there is no comparison betweene these holy Churches of God, which were truly gathered, planted &amp; orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and these their confused idolatrous assemblies.

               <p>But these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take these places, where the sinnes of these churches are thus sharply reprehended &amp; censured, and would iustifie therby, the receauing, reteining &amp; nourishing al this profane rowt of people in the bosome of their churches: as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I haue aboue shewed, that fastes are vpon especial and present occasions, actions, calamities, &amp;c. to be exercised, to the humbling &amp; preparing the bodie and soule vnto true repentance, praier &amp; other holy exercises.

So then we see how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Yet is there a third and fourth kind of baptisme in the Church of England; namely the hasty baptisme done by the midwife: who if she see the childe in peril and like to dye, before yt can be brought to the Church; then is she to bestir her, &amp; giue the child the christendome, least yt neuer come in heauen: and this baptisme is warranted by their seruice-Boke to be lawful and sufficient baptisme: and the Priest fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding yt orderly done by the cunning midwife, is to publish yt in the Church to be verie good &amp; allowable, and to commend them that so orderly did yt, at that time of necessitie.</p>
               <p>But if the Priest vpon the examination of the matter, find that the midwife was not cunning in this trade; but for haste or feare for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got or left out some of her accomplementes: then must he (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <p>Their other sacrament of the supper also is not free of the like found trifling &amp; superstitious additions: and is by their SERVICE-BOOK diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into 2 sortes: publike, of al together in their Synagogue; &amp; priuate in their houses, called the communion of the sick. In their publike communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Priest (araied in his ministerial vesture) is placed at the north end of the Table, and there is to read his certayne. He is there nurtured, vvhen to turne to the Table, when to the people, when to stand, when to kneele; vvhat, and vvhen to say. The people (after they haue offred to the priest) are in their place to kneele downe to say and answere the Priest at his turnes &amp; times, as is prescribed in their Masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book: vvhere (after Sr. priest hath taken a say, and begun to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) he deliuereth vnto them (as they kneele) their maker after the old popish manner, altering the wordes and forme of institution deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by our Sauiour and his Apostles, saying. THE BODY of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, which was giuen for thee &amp;c. It were long to set downe their preambles and seuerall Collectes at this their communion, as at their Christ-masse day, their Easter day, Assention day, vvhite-sunday Trinitie sunday, and how the whole queir, priest &amp; people glorie God, with Angels &amp; Archangelles and all the companie of heauen &amp;c. and after they haue receiued the priestes blessing, they are all dismissed with peace.</p>
               <p>But now their priuate communion or housling of the sick, is after a more cursorie &amp; briefe maner; with a short litle pistle &amp; gospel, and nothing so manie <hi>Pater nosters, Creedes,</hi> Collectes, Anthemes, nor such solemne exhortations, because the sick desires to haue yt with him out of the vvorld. He must prouide the implementes and some of his frendes (if he may be so much beholding vnto them) to take part with him.

               <p>And so may they draw an argument from thence for them al, thus.

ceremonies and heathenish pompe and customes, I would here faine know of our learned priestes, where in all the Bible, they learned to say praiers or preach ouer (I wil not though I truly might say) for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead. As I take yt, they haue neither president nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement for yt in the word of God. yet there we read of sundrie christian burials: as of our Sauiour CHRIST, STEPHEN &amp; others; where we reade neither of<note place="margin">Ioh. 19. 38. &amp;c.</note> dirgies nor sermons ouer them, though there were Apostles &amp; sundrie other able men to haue done yt.

               <p>The next question is, why (of all other places) men must be buried in the Church or Churchyard? els they haue not Christen mens bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial; but if they be not buried there and that by the priest, with his booke, then are they buried like doggs, say the common people. Me thinkes those of all other should not be the conuenientest places: It was a thing neuer vsed vntill popery began; yt is neither comly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, nor wholsome.</p>
               <p>Well, now the last question is concerning these solemne mourners araid in black, many of them with hoodes, caps, crosses and other knackes: where they learned thus to bemourne &amp; lament their dead, by I know not how many moneths? They will tell me tis lawfull to mourne &amp; sorrow for the dead; God beareth so far with our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

After al is done in Church, then are they all gathered together to a costly &amp; sumptuous banquet.

               <p>I wil not here cumber our priestes with ouer many questions, least they answere me none of these.

Yet hath yt within also al the holy armie of saintes &amp; Angels in their windowes and walles, to keep yt. Thus I think can be no doubt made, but that the verie erections of these synagogues (whether they were by the heathens or papistes) were idolatrous.</p>
               <p>But heere I look to haue obiected these two reasons against me: the one for the defence of the original, the other for the present estate of them: namly, that many of these superstitions I speake of, were inve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted long after <hi>England</hi> receaued the faith, and therfore the original of these churches could not be so euil: the other, that now (thankes be to God) they are quite purged of all these idols in the walles and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, &amp; vsed to the pure worship of God; therfore I doe not wel so to write of them in this estate.</p>
               <p>To the first reason (but that I loue not to raue in the apocrypha wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings as they do with the papistes, &amp; therfore neuer bring their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies to end) I could shew most of these idolatrous shapes and cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, to haue been very ancient, &amp; in deed by al likelihood, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first building of these synagogues, &amp; therfore yt skilleth not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether all these idolatries were invented at the first bringing of their faith into <hi>England;</hi> seing yt is manifest that most of these chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were built many yeres after. For (as hath beene said) they at the first contented themselues with such temples as they ere while wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped their idols in: so that they that wil obiect vnto me some few of their temples built in a round forme, must both be sure that they were not built by heathens, and that al these romish relikes of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, porch, hallowed belles, font, images in the walles and windowes &amp;c. were added since the building therof: And this I suppose wil be hard for them t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> doe. The papistes can prescribe a long time for their images and manie other thinges: yet all this if they could doe, vvhat vvere these few vnto all the other so manie thowsandes as vve see to carrie these idolatrous shapes euen from the verie foundation, vvhich vve know, and vvith our eies haue seene thus defiled vvith idols and odolatrie? so that yt shalbe needles for them to trouble themselues vvith things farther off, vvhen these things stil remaine
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:12207:71"/>
in this shape before our eies.</p>
               <p>And this also may answere their second allegation, where they alledg them now to be quite purged of all the former Idols &amp; idolatrie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were defiled. How then doe they still stand in their old ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous shapes, with their auncient appurtinances, with their Courts, cells, isles, chancel, belles &amp;c. Can these remaine, &amp; al idolatrous shapes and relickes be purged from them? which are so inseperably inherent vnto the whole building, as yt can neuer be clensed of this fretting le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie, vntil yt be desolate, layd on heapes, as their yonger sisters<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, the Abbaies &amp; Monasteries are.</p>
               <p>We see how sodainly euen in few daies they may be replenished and garnished with all their idols againe. We had a late proofe therof in Q. Maries time, which is not yet taken out of the common peoples mindes; who in doubt of the like hereafter, partly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> superstition, but generally because they would not be at the like charge to buye new, haue reserued the old relikes still: some of them standing vp in their Church windowes, others kept in their chestes &amp; vesteries; yea sundry of them are still in vse: as their belles, font, organes, copes, surplices, the couering cloth of the altar &amp;c. vvhich way can these be purged, so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as thy remaine in this shape. Their whole Church also, is yt not still a fit shrine to receaue all the rest? vvhat letteth that they might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ot be set vp againe (if the Idols were in readines) in one hower? seing their very roomths still remayne as they left them, and want but a litle sweeping: so that euerie Sainct may know &amp; take his old place againe. And as yt standeth with the whole frame of their Church walles, windowes, and implementes: so standeth yt in like maner with the whole ministerie of this Church, from the highest bishop to the lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They may all together within the space of one howre, with a litle changing of their copye, serue againe in their ould roomths which they held in the church of Rome, to which this minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie of theirs a great deale better fitteth then vnto the Church of CHRIST, which can beare no such adulterate &amp; antichristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ministerie.</p>
               <p>Well then you see what good reformation they haue made, &amp; how throughly they haue purged their Churches of poperie &amp; idolatrie, &amp; that not only spiritual idolatry (as in their worship &amp; administration aboue hath beene shewed) but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And now not any longer insisting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of SOME his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, I denie his Argument at once: That because the vse of many thinges whose original is impure, may be pure: therfore these idol places and temples may be vsed to the worship of God.

               <p>I must still denie his Argument. First he hath not heere proued, that this gold of the Midianites was either in any idolatrous formes, or had bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It is easie to put difference betwixt the substance of Idolaters, as gold, siluer, oxen, sheep, cattell: &amp; their Idols, &amp; idol places.

                  </note> the iewels of gold, bracelets, chaines, rings, eare rings, ornaments of legges (as the text recordeth) &amp; the Lord accepted them.

The landes, goodes, cattel, of idolaters, we may purchase, inherite, vse &amp; inioy: their idols, euen of the most pretious mettals, we are to detest &amp; destroie. Yet euen here in this example, they were commanded to purge all that might goe through the fire, by the fire &amp; with the water<note place="margin">

Furthermore, from them they

fetch their licence to preach, with their lawes of stint, limitation, and praescription, when to preach, what to preach, where and how long to preach; but especially by publike doctrine not to speake against any thing by publike authoritie inioined, or by the same authoritie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be inioyned; as also, to exhort their parishioners vnto the due obedience &amp; obseruation of such iniunctions.</p>
               <p>And that this be faithfully performed, their Lords the BBs. haue not only the othes of the priestes, to obserue &amp;c. and of the Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and sidemen, to present the defaltes therof; but their seuerall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties &amp; officers, as <hi>Archdeacons, Chancelors, Commissaries,</hi> to keep their courts &amp; scenes to see these things obserued &amp; punish y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offending; to which substitutes &amp; courts they are al attendant &amp; accomptable.</p>

How much more then ought yt in the true substance to be built in euery thing according to the heauenly perfect patterne of <hi>Christs</hi> Testament, wherin we haue the whole mind and will of CHRIST as the Apostle saith in the last words of the second chapter of this epistle?

For if they teach otherwise &amp; come not to the wholsome wordes of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and to the doctrine which is according to godlines, they are puft vp know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing.

So far are we from giuing that authoritie vnto her in this presumptuous sin, as to draw an argument from, or be induced to thinke by her example, that because she casteth off CHRISTS yoke &amp; beareth Antichrists, therfore the holy order &amp; ordinances of CHRIST for the building, ministery, &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church is not perpetuall, necessarie, or alwaies expedient.</p>
               <p>I grant that the true Church of Christ may sometimes vpon some necessities be without this holy order for a season, as in the first gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Saints, especially now when we are not to expect anie such miraculous or extraordinarie giuing of Gods Spirit as was in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue times, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we cannot sodenly either be made fit for these high offices, or haue such perfect knowledg and probation ech of others giftes and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

be without this established order: but this is neither willinglie to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect yt, nor presumptuously to reiect yt. Heerehence yt followeth not that this holie order is not alwaies necessarie, because yt is not nor cannot be alwaies executed: So they might conclude all Gods lawes not alwayes necessarie, perpetuall, or expedient, because they are not or cannot be alwayes practised by vs. Should our infirmitie, sinne o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This would as wel follow of this their reason, as the other: that because the Church of CHRIST may at sometimes be without this established or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of CHRIST and yet be held the true Church, therfore that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed order of CHRIST is not perpetuall, alwaies necessarie, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient: thus laijng the default vpon CHRISTS sacred ordinances, as though they were notalwaies holy necessarie &amp; conuenient, which in deed is due to vs an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:12207:117"/>The third point in this cauilling questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, to know where these of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers aboue said practised that gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in an equalitie without su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie in one aboue an other. It hath beene euen now shewed how this gouernment belongeth &amp; is committed to the whole bodie, how their office consisteth to teach the Church how to practise yt &amp; to see yt obserued by al in due order, and not ambitiously to assume yt wholy into their owne hands. For the rest, though there be a communion in the Church, yet there is no equalitie. The Church knoweth how to giue honour &amp; reuerence vnto their Elders, especially to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> labor in the word &amp; doctrine. The Church of CHRIST is taught to obey &amp; submit vnto their leaders, to acknowledg them that labour amongst them &amp; that are set ouer them in the Lord, &amp; to admonish them, and to hold those in superabundant loue for their worke sake: The Elders also amongst themselues know how to giue honour one vnto another by going before; yet al this without preiudice to themselues that giue, or detrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to him that receaueth yt, without the losse of the least iote of their owne libertie, or puffing him vp, or setting him in anie vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authoritie. They giue yt to his labor, diligence, vertue and desert; which ceassing, they straight withdraw their praise, &amp; in the stead ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vse exhortation, admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea (if need be) censure. All the parts of mans bodie are not alike esteemed and vsed; we haue much more care and tendernes ouer the eies then of the hands or feet, yet may not the eye heerby refuse to doe seruice and attend to the hand or foote in all their busines and affaires, neither may yt disturbe the least member of the bodie in their peculiar office &amp; functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or intrude into their place. The eye guideth &amp; directeth the hand, shewing how yt ought to doe the worke: the hand againe washeth, wipeth, and doth all louing helpe yt may vnto the eye. Both eie &amp; hand &amp; euerie other part of the body are distinct members, yet so knit and ioined together in the bodie, as they do their due seruice vnto the eie, &amp; ech vnto other in the whole, not confounding the order of nature, nor disturbing ech other in the worke.

All the gifts God hath giuen any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, are to the seruice of the whole bodie: he that will be greatest must be as the least, he must wash the feet &amp; not haue his feete kissed of the least: all superioritie is heere comprised within the bounds of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian order &amp; modestie.

I neuer heard of any speciall bequest <hi>Timothy</hi> made to these Lord Bishops aboue all other, neither can I see from hence, why they should vsurpe this iurisdiction ouer their superiors; namely ouer the parish Priests &amp; parsons that stad for Pastors, these Bishops (if they haue any office) being put Elders. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this rule the Parson should keep court ouer the Bishops, &amp; not the Bishop ouer so many Parsons.

that should bind him to <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; to the Saints, how can they hold him a member of <hi>Christ,</hi> a Saint, or admit him as a brother amongst them in their praiers, ministery, contribution?

               <p>By the first reason it should seeme that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                  </gap>here wil be litle se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele of this reason; that because the Q Maiestie directeth this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to honorable &amp; reuerend men of the clergie &amp; temporalty, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the high Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission is not antichristian or vnlawfull.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission is like to proue antichristian, this honorable reuerend clergie which beare al the rule in this Commission, being so immediatly deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and directly discended from that Antichrist of Rome.

               <p>There is as litle sequele of his second reason; that because this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission hath some good branches, as to purge Gods religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of popery, anabaptistry, to punish &amp; to suppresse notable disorders, as incests, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamies, oppression of ministers: therfore this whole high Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission is good &amp; godly. Might not the most vngodly councels y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer were, be thus defended &amp; iustified? because they decreed not some, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things? Might not any sect or heresy be thus also defended &amp; iustified? because they hold &amp; teach many good things? yet iudge we such ecclesiasticall councels &amp; assemblies antichristian, which haue no warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the word of God, where the holy ghost is not both the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor &amp; ruler.
