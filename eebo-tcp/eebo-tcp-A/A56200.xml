            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> when conquered and driven out of this their Countrey by <hi>Saxons,</hi> and the extraordinary <hi>Pestilence and Famine</hi> sent amongst them for their sins, and then a dieu both to our <hi>Religion and Nation.</hi> But in case the King should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to conquer us by their power, the least we can expect is, First, a continuall <hi>long lasting Warre,</hi> and open hostility by Land and Sea with all Romish Kings and States, the very charge whereof, now we are almost quite <hi>undone</hi> and begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red already, which will utterly ruine and undo us. Secondly, losse of Trade and Commerce with all those Kingdoms and States, with whom we are in hostility; which will utterly break us in one year or two for want of venting our Native commodities, our chiefest inablement to <hi>maintain</hi> the Wars. Thirdly, intolerable <hi>uncessant</hi> Taxes of all sorts, which will every moneth grow heavier and greater then other, which accompanied with want of Trade, will cause a generall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection at last both of poor and rich against those in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and put all into <hi>confusion,</hi> to the enemies great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Fourthly, a necessity of seizing and selling all Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57195:10"/>
Corporations, Companies, Hospitalls and Gleab-Lands throughout the Realm; and of new <hi>Projects</hi> to make new <hi>Delinquents,</hi> of purpose to raise moneys to defray the extraordinary expences of the Armies and Navies: And what garboils this will produce, all prudent persons may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily conjecture. Fiftly, a generall decay of Religion, Piety, Learning, Law, and all Arts, Sciences, Trades. Sixthly, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary new effusion of Christian bloud. Seventhly, an inundation of all kind of sin, wickednesse, Atheism, Heresie, Blasphemy, Murders, Rapes, Robberies, Oppressions, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Drunkennesse, Dissolutenesse, Barbarousnesse, and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Laws, Magistrates, Ministers, Parents, and other disorders. Eighthly, Free-quarter, insolences of Souldiers, spoiling, plundring, if not pestilence and famine, the usuall Concomitants of Warre, which will reduce us to a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worse then nothing in conclusion.</p>
                  <p>If he cast himself upon Forraign Protestant Kings, Princes and States alone, the far better, though unlikelier of the two; yet this will certainly prove, 1. A great dishonour to God, and scandall to reformed Religion, to see them so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and unchristian as to imbrue their hands in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bloud. 2. An extraordinary ground of joy and triumph to the Pope and his Confederates, to behold their enemies thus murthering, invading, and destroying each other by their mutuall dissentions; when they by all their power and policy were unable to accomplish their ruine, and do them so great mischief. 3. A great indangering of all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches and States in Europe, by incouraging their Popish Adversaries to invade and ruine them, whilest thus ingaged in an unbrotherly and unchristian Warre between themselves, and <hi>weakening, impoverishing</hi> and <hi>destroying</hi> each other. 5. An effusion of much precious Protestant bloud, which will <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 4.10, 11. Jer. 51.35. Ezek. 35, 5.6, 7, 8, 9.</note> cry for <hi>vengeance</hi> to heaven against the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Authors and Occasioners of such a Warre. 6. If the King shall inthrone himself, and regain his Kingdomes by their assistance; though the profession of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may still be continued, yet we may justly fear, 1. That
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57195:10"/>
the purity and power of Religion will be much abated. 2. That our Lawes and Liberties will be much indangered and Eclipsed. 3. Our estates confiscated to make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, and satisfie the Kings Ingagements. 4. Their removall hence will be disputable, when once possessed of our Country; as the history of the Danes invasions of this Island heretofore, and the Saxons full possession thereof, with the Britains expulsion, will manifest. 5. If the King and they be repulsed by us, yet this will prove a seminary of lasting wars and breaches between us and most Protestant Kingdoms and States; It will hinder all commerce between them and us, to the destruction of Merchandize and Trade; destroy the Protestants strength and interest; impoverish us through Taxes, fill us with d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If he throw himself upon forraign Papists and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants joyntly, then, First, the Wars are like to be more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, dangerous and costly to us, and of longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Secondly, The divisions and dangers from at home are like to prove the greater, since all discontented and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Protestants and Papists will then be apt upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions and advantages to joyn with that forraign party they best affect, and from whom they may expect the most favour and the best conditions. Thirdly, If the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, then both Parties must be satisfied, and his debts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed out of our estates; both gratified with a free tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and exercise of that Religion throughout his Realms as both sides professe: and between them both all will be plundered, impoverished, ruined, and perchance inforced to quit the whole Kingdom to one or both of them, who will challenge an interest therein by conquest and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest sword, and hardly part with it when once pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed thereof. Fourthly, If the King and they should be foiled by us, yet the wars and differences would survive, all commerce and trading lost, Armies and Navies must still be maintained, and Garrisons in all our Kingdoms to secure us; taxes, oppressions, and all publike grievances continued and

<q>Above the rest, the Millenaries have exalted themselves, whose abominable Pamphlets have flown abroad like Atomes, wherein they dream of a Personall Reign of Christ upon Earth, how he shall descend from Heaven <hi>An.</hi> 1666, destroy all the works of darknesse in every corner of the Earth, make an easie passage to men from Earth to Heaven, so that they may ascend into Heaven, and leap down to Earth again, as oft as they list: how he shall keep a Quarter Sessions or Goal-delivery in his own Person upon Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> call all Nations before him, rebuke them of sin face to face, and shall cut out of them their stony hearts, and shall sew in their bellies hearts of flesh in stead thereof: that <hi>An.

All which Fopperies with many mo too horrid to
<pb facs="tcp:57195:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
relate, are contained in M. <hi>Archers</hi> Personall Reign of Christ upon Earth, <hi>Rich. Stirreys</hi> Kingdome of King Jesus, and in <hi>A.R.</hi> his <hi>Caelestis Hierusalem,</hi> Printed <hi>A.</hi> 1642, 1644, and 1645. Now having unmasked the vanity of this Error <hi>(ut contraria juxtà se posita magis elucescant)</hi> I will epitomize in this Section the truth of the future estate of the World, from this time to the end, which afterward I intend (God willing) further to dilate and prosecute in this Treatise. This year 1650 all <hi>Europe</hi> are in civil Warres. These civill warres shall not cease till they have mustered out a great Army of the true worshippers of God to ruine Rome, which shall be about <hi>Anno</hi> 1666. Rome thus destroyed, the Western Jews shall begin to learn the waies of God, and believe his Gospel (which they cannot do so long as Rome standeth) and shall <hi>Anno</hi> 1683. enter upon the conversion of their Eastern brethren (the 10. Tribes now invisibly hid in Tartaria and India) and they two (none else) shall ruine the Mahumetan Empire about <hi>An.</hi> 1698. and so shall be restored to the holy Land to reinhabit Jerusalem. Then must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a comparative felicity of the Church of God upon earth, because after these times both Turk and Pope shall be destroyed. Neverthelesse this felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty must be mingled with internall troubles and persecutions, within the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the Church, because the Church shall never be wholly at rest, while the world standeth. Lo, here the difference betwixt Truth and Heresie, betwixt the opinions of the Millenaries and right sense of Scriptures. The Millenaries say, Christ must descend personally from heaven: The Scriptures on the contrary say, he shall not come from Heaven personally till the last day, when he shall descend with his holy Angels in flaming fire to judge the quick and the dead. He shall send power and strength from heaven to his true Worshipppers (as he hath done hitherto) to destroy Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I received the other day, from my dear Friend <hi>Iohn Baudensis,</hi> the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Astrologers concerning that terrible Comet which appeared <hi>Anno</hi> 1618, and about the later Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Behold thou then a Prophecie (if not Apostolical) yet (if I mistake not) far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Astrological. GOD hath arisen and drawn his sword: There shall happen in these our European Regions, the destruction of great Emperours, the slaughter of people, Funerals of Kings, subversions of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, mutations of Monarchies, massacres of Princes and illustrious Commanders, violent and proud Counsels, Treasons and Rebellions amongst Subjects: Clergie-men shall finde a change of Laws and Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Constitutions, by those of greater power, and an insatiable desire of new things amongst common people. The Northern parts of Europe shall be greatly oppressed with Warre, Sicknesse and Pestilence. Rich men shall be impoverished, Princes cast out of their Dominions; The fathers shall be banished, and after a long space of trouble their children shall be restored to their former condition. This Comet also threatneth the terrible ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> and burnings in all the Cities of Europe. The Papistical Clergy, especially the Cardinals, shall be cast down from their Dignities, the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites every where shall be drawn to death, neither shall the French-men or Spaniards have courage to save their necks from the halters. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, We discern a Kingdom to arise of the most ancient Inhabitants in the holy Land, which to Christians shall be a Miracle, and to the World a terrour; and these shall obtain the Revolution of a new Empire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which shall be administred universal Gladnesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus far the words of this Letter. And how punctually all these things are come to passe, let the world judge. We in England have felt the misery of the one, and are ready stript to suffer the calamities of the other, having for the present lost what is impossible to be regained, and seeing a new storm of Devastations hanging over our heads by the young Kings late arrival in <hi>Scotland</hi> (where he is received as absolute Soveraign) which fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ghost. There is in this 20 Chap. two severall Epoches of a 1000 years, which are two severall waies to be interpreted. The first is in <hi>vers.</hi> 2. of Satan being bound for a 1000 years; which must begin either at the Instant of our Saviours Incarnation, and end at <hi>An.</hi> 1000, in the 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this in the 8 <hi>vers.</hi> of the Saints reigning with Christ a 1000 years, <hi>Alsted, Bucholcherus</hi> and others expound of a Comparative Felicity of the Church on this Earth, for a 1000 years, beginning <hi>An.</hi> 1694, when they say<q> all visible Enemies of the Church shall be overthrown, and must end <hi>An. Ch.</hi> 2694. after which shall be the Warre of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> against the Church, which shall be prevented by the coming of Christ to judgement.</q>
But in this <hi>Alsted</hi> is wide from the right mark: for this number must begin <hi>An.</hi> 1072, at the expiration of the former, and must be interpreted for all that time that the World shall last after the aforesaid <hi>An.</hi> 1072. And the holy Ghost doth term this indefinite and unlimited time by the Number of a 1000 years, for three speciall Reasons: 1 Because a 1000 years are the Number of Perfection and of Eternity, and doth most aptly serve to expresse the End of these Earthly Troubles, and the beginning of that Time which never shall have end. 2 Because those things which the holy Ghost in the Scriptures affirmeth are yet to come, must not be plenarily accomplished till after <hi>An.</hi> 1830, it may please God that the glorious and flourishing estate of the Church and Gospel here upon Earth, may continue much of 200 years longer, to increase the number of them who shall be saved, and to amplifie more the heavenly At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of Gods Mercy, Righteousnesse, Truth, Holinesse and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in the Salvation of the Just: and his Equity, Judgement and Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the firebrands of destruction. 3 Because a vicissitudinary time of Affliction and Ease, Persecution and rest, pure Doctrine and Heresies, is signified to be the whole continuance or most part of a 1000 years, wherein those who are to suffer for the Testimony of the Word of God, and the truth of Jesus Christ, shall have their reward after the expiration of that time, which cannot be till after the last generall Judgement.

of certain memorable Numbers in holy Scriptures. Grave and judicious Authours have with wonder and admiration observed the heavenly and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable Method of holy Scrjptures, how all the Mysteries and memorable Occurrences in the same are comprized in Numbers, how within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of such a Quantity of years, God alwayes divulged his Counsels, and manifested what he purposed should be wrought among the children of men. So that in considering the admirable consent and agreement of Times by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> things past, we may probably conjecture of things to come. From the Creation to the Floud was 1656 years: the Floud was a sign of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of all those things which are to be fulfilled before the conclusion of time. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1656, let the Church of God expect with joy and comfort, the acting of the first Scene of the Tragedies of all those European Kingdoms, which have been implacable Persecutours of the Gospel of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Christ. The whole Government of <hi>Moses</hi> (who was a second <hi>Noah</hi> to the Church) is a shadow of the Kingdom of Christ. The Law continued in force 1529 years to the Passion of Christ: But 1598 years to the Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Temple by <hi>Titus:</hi> The Destruction of the Temple by <hi>Titus</hi> was according to the accompt of <hi>Dionysius Exiguus, A.

From the universal Deluge of man-kinde by the Floud to the beginning of the universal Captivity of the Church under <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> beleaguering <hi>Ierusalem</hi> are numbered 1698 years: So likewise from the Birth of the King of Kings unto the final Consummation of the Miseries, and restauration of the Felicity of the Church by the Destruction of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> shall be reckoned the very same Number of 1698 years.

                     <p>M. <hi>Fox</hi> expounds these 12 years to be 12 Turkish Emperours prevailing against Christians, beginning at the first Emperour <hi>Ottoman</hi> An. 1300. and so <hi>Solyman</hi> the magnificent to be the twelfth Emperour, and the last that should prevail against Christians; who began his reign <hi>An.</hi> 1519. and died <hi>An.</hi> 1567. But I think rather it must begin at <hi>Mahomet</hi> the II. winning of Constantinople (called here <hi>rubrum pomum</hi>) An. 1452. and must end at the late Emperour <hi>Mahomet</hi> the IV. his death the last August, 1649. My reason is this: Other Emperours have prevailed against Christians, since <hi>Solyman</hi> the magnificent. For <hi>Selimus</hi> the II. his son wan <hi>Cyprus</hi> from the <hi>Venetians. Armurath</hi> III. took the Fort <hi>Guiermo</hi> from the Hungarians, and his son <hi>Mahomet</hi> III. took <hi>Agria</hi> in Hungary, and had he pursued his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, had won that whole Kingdom in lesse then a year: So the late <hi>Mahomet</hi> is the 12 Emperour from <hi>Mahomet</hi> the II. and now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

prophecie both of the Roman Heathenish Empire, as likewise of the Papacy with her chief Leagurers to this present time throughout the whole Chapter. This Eagle is that Roman Heathenish Empire; her twelve fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered wings are the twelve first Emperours from <hi>Iulius Cesar</hi> to <hi>Nerva Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceius.</hi> The three Heads are the three Kingdoms of <hi>France, Spain</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> preordained of God to uphold and maintain the power of her pride, when all her wings (her heathenish and tyrannicall <hi>Cesars</hi>) should fail her. Neverthelesse, under her 12 first <hi>Cesars</hi> are comprehended in generall all the Emperours which reigned in her from <hi>Iulius Cesar</hi> (who first crackt the strings of her liberty) to <hi>Augustulus Momyllus</hi> (her last Roman <hi>Cesar</hi>) for the space of 474 years. Her 8 contrary feathers are the 8 terrible Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of severall Nations from the North (God's scourges) which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed her fairest Provinces, sunk her State in bloud, and by fire and sword humbled her as low as the dust she trod on; <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Alaricus</hi> and his West-Gothes, 2 <hi>Attilas</hi> and his Hunnes, 3 <hi>Gensericus</hi> and his Vandals, 4 <hi>Odoacer,</hi> 5 <hi>Theodoricus</hi> and his East-Goths, 6 <hi>Totilas</hi> and his Spaniards, 7 <hi>Alboinus</hi> and his Longobards (who deposed her diminitive <hi>Cesar Augustulus Momyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>) 8 and lastly, the intestine homebred Faction and Conspiracy, which proved more pernitious then the rest (as all included diseases are the worst) which in the reigns of <hi>Otho</hi> the Great, <hi>Otho</hi> III, and <hi>Frederique</hi> II, so often strove to eradicate the Papall Superiority, and reedifie her S.P.Q.R. buried so many ages ago out of the ruines of the City. The Head in the midst is the <hi>Germane</hi> Empire, begun <hi>An.</hi> 801 on Christmas day, by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, which though <hi>vers.</hi> 32. it long did and yet doth put the Earth in great fear, yet <hi>vers.</hi> 33. must vanish in an instant, as did the Wings, and come to nought. The <hi>Germane</hi> Empire thus destroied, <hi>vers.</hi> 35. The Head on the right side (the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi>) must devour the Head on the left side, which is the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> Therefore it is manifest, That the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> though now it flourisheth in what Glory and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence Earth can afford, must ere long be humbled by the power of <hi>Spain,</hi> with many Discomfitures, and brought to dolefull streights and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities. I my self have observed one remarkable Adjunct of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in particular, how that year (in which the Figures of the Golden Number were equall to the Figures of the year of Christ) hath ever proved fatall to that Monarchy for Warre, Bloudshed, Pestilence and Famine. It was so with them from <hi>An.</hi> 1570 to <hi>An.</hi> 1576. in all which seven years, the Guisian faction made lamentable havock of the Church of God and the Kingdom; so shall it be in that year in which the finall Tragedy of that Kingdom shall be acted, six years after which <hi>France</hi> shall be no more. But when that shall be, no sign of <hi>Europe</hi> shall remain, nor remembrance where the wals of <hi>Rome</hi> stood. The LION (which <hi>vers.</hi> 37. and <hi>chap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 31. came roaring out of the Wood speaking to the Eagle, and rebuking her for her wickednesse) is the WIND which the most high God hath kept for <hi>Rome</hi> and her wickednesse till the end, even the LION OF THE NORTH (of which you shall hear anon a Prophesie of the true <hi>Merlin</hi>) which shall reprove the Roman Empire, and cast before her her spoils; he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57195:30"/>
shall set her alive in Judgement, rebuke and correct her, and deliver the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of Gods people by Afflicton which are preserved upon his borders and make them joyfull untill the day of Judgement. In the 13 Chapter, <hi>Esdras</hi> beholds a vision of a man rising out of the Sea, and devouring the multitudes of fighters that came against him, neither with sword, spear nor any instrument of Warre, but only with the fire and storm that came out of his mouth; which is Christ the son of man, who through a sea of bloudy persecutions and tribulations propagated his Gospel over the Earth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding and devouring the multitudinous Pagans and Idolaters fighting against Christians, by the invincible force of the Gospel. After a long time of the obstinate wilfulnesse and fulnesse of the Gentiles, he shall call to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self another peaceable multitude, <hi>vers.</hi> 12, 40. even the whole Nation of the Jews, out of <hi>Armenia, Tartaria,</hi> and the Eastern <hi>India,</hi> whom God shall defend and convert to the Gospel, when he shall destroy all other Nations upon Earth. These are called the peaceable People, because after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Jews, shall come that Ministeriall Monarchy of the Church over the whole World; that <hi>peaceable and still Time,</hi> when all Kingdoms under heaven shall forget fighting one against another, Warres shall cease in all the World, and swords and spears shall be beaten into Plowshares and pruning hooks. When the seventh Angel blew the Trumpet, <hi>Luther</hi> began his Reformation, then it is, when the <hi>Multitude</hi> stood before the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and sung the new song of <hi>Moses</hi>; and then neverthelesse is but the vail only of the Tabernacle opened in heaven, and a great cloud and smoak covered that Glory. But it must be 180 years after, when the Kingdomes of this World become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, and those be destroyed that destroyed the Earth. For then and not till then shall the Temple of God be fully opened in Heaven, and the Ark of his Testament (the very same modell, which God shewed to <hi>Moses</hi> in the Mount) shall be seen in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> not in a Tabernacle, but in that Temple, which the power of God shall make. Then shall lastly, the four Beasts, the Elders, with all the Angels of Heaven, and all the creatures of Heaven and Earth, and of the Sea and under the Earth fall down before the Throne, and give glory, honour, blessing and praise unto him that sitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever, and the four Beasts shall say, <hi>Amen.</hi>

It is strange, and makes me give more credit to <hi>Esdras</hi> then otherwise I would, to see how pat he goes with our Saviour Christ, in affirming the second Captivity of the Jews to be long, and that their return should be about the ruine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. He relates how the ten Tribes (soon after their Captivity by <hi>Salmanasser</hi>) travelled through a great River or strait (perhaps the Streits of <hi>Anian</hi>) in a long journey of many moneths or years to a Country not inhabited. Yea many good Authors, who write of the Histories of <hi>America,</hi> relate how the <hi>Maxicans</hi> have a Tradition (delivered from father to son, time out of minde) of a great multitude coming a great journey into those parts with an Ark car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before them on mens shoulders, with their God inclosed therein. These people certainly were Jews, from whom they learned Circumcision (which our travellers finde in most of their Coasts) with other Rites of Tribes, Heads of Tribes and Families, with some handsome Ceremonies of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, Funerals and Washings, directly the same with the Jews or Israelites.

In the first of <hi>Acts</hi> our Saviour Christs Disciples shewed how greatly the Jews expected for this time, when their <hi>Messiah</hi> should deliver them from the yoke of the Romans, and restore them to their temporal Kingdom in <hi>Iudea</hi>; as likewise how near they thought the season and period to be in our Saviours time, when they came to him, saying, <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the Kingdom to Israel?</hi> Our Saviour in his Answer doth not deny but that such a time was to be, when the Jews should be restored to their temporal Kingdom in their own Land (which should exceed <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> in magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and should extend over the whole world) but only blames and checks his Apostles for enquiring of that which neither was needful for them to know, neither should be in their dayes; as likewise for being too inquisitive in the times and seasons when it should be, and was to begin, <hi>Which</hi> (said he) <hi>the Father hath put in his own power.</hi> And whoso reads <hi>Hos.</hi> 3.4, 5. the four last Chapters of <hi>Zechary,</hi> Mich. 7.15, 16, 17.

No Jew in the world ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded otherwise from the 36. verse to the 43. of that Song. And to this place they referre their afflictions which they have, and shall suffer all the time of the Roman Empire till their Restauration. There is but few of them now, but will confesse that their Messiah <hi>Ben-Ioseph,</hi> is come already, but their <hi>Ben-David</hi> is yet hid in the depth of the Sea, and will arise from thence about the finall end of the destruction of the Gentiles.</p>

But when that time shall be, I have abundantly shewn in the Sections before. And in that season shall <hi>Benjamin</hi> be sent down from his good father in the power of his right arm, and <hi>Ioseph</hi> (even <hi>Ben-Ioseph</hi>) shall make himself known to his Brethren, who did hate him, shoot at him, cast him into the pir, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him to the Gentiles.

Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians have made their four Monarchies according to the rise or fall of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall particular Nations. 1. Assyrians. 2. Persians. 3. Grecians. and 4. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: but this is a lame Division, and comes far short of that transcendent Metamorphosis of humane affairs, which (by comparing of Histories, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of new Starres and Comets of late, with the consideration of the manners and conditions of the sonnes of men) we may easily perceive must within these few years be brought upon the world. The learned Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Philosophers (who have more throughly searched into the secrets of Astrology) rightlier place their four Monarchies according to the four coasts of Heaven. 1. The Eastern Monarchy of the Assyrians. 2. The two Southern Monarchies of the Persians and Grecians, bounded within the circumference of 3600 miles, or 11 degrees of latitude. 3. The Western Monarchy of the Romans. 4. and lastly, the Northern Monarchy (but in right accompt the fifth) must be of the Northern LION, which to the amazement of Christendome, shall arise from the Northern Sea, and pitch his Tents in the ashes of the Eastern and Western Monarchies. But now having made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so oft of this V. Monarchy in this Pamphlet,<note place="margin">Reasons of the V. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</note> I think it meet to produce two or three Reasons of the truth and certainty of it, deduced out of the holy Scriptures and humane Authority.</p>
                     <p n="1">First, The Jews have a Tenet among them, That their Messias must not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> come in the Flesh till the destruction of the fourth Monarchy in <hi>Daniel,</hi> which is the Roman: and so will not beleeve Christians professing him to be come already: but say, this coming is deferred till the Roman Empire be totally abolished; which because it is not nor must be yet, they will not beleeve he hath appeared. But the Jews are deceived in this, for <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. and 7.9, 22. the Incarnation of our Saviour Christ was promised to be in the very nick of the constitution and establishment of the Roman Empire, and not after the ruine of it (which was performed accordingly) else should there have been six Monarchies before the end of the world. For the dispersion and rejection of the Jews, the revelation of Antichrist with the Fulnesse of the Gentiles, was prophesied to be accomplished in the fourth Monarchy, all which we see are punctually fulfilled. None of which should yet have come to passe, if our Saviour Christ was not to be incarnate before the end of the Roman Empire. Therefore as the rejection of the Jews with these other signs and things was to be in the fourth Monarchy; so their conversion and remission into the Church, and the glorious estate of the Gospel upon earth must be in another fifth Monarchy, which is yet to come.</p>
                     <p n="2">Secondly, So many Empires as are comprized in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> (<hi>Dan.</hi> 2.) must come to passe before the end of the World: But five Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies are comprehended in that Image, <hi>Erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57195:34"/>
Monarchy, which by his Chaldean Empire and the ruine thereof (which was approaching) should totally be annihilated. The Armes and Brests of Silver are the Empire of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> The Belly of brasse is the Empire of the <hi>Grecians</hi> by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. Lastly, the Iron Leggs and the Clay Toes depictured the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, with the present declining House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the breathlesse Papacy. Therefore <hi>the Stone cut with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hands which brake this Image in pieces, and became a Mountain and filled the Earth,</hi> must be understood (as I touched before) of a Fifth Monarchy yet to come, in which, by the Conversion of the Jews and fulnesse of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles the Gospel shall shine in majesty over all Kingdoms upon Earth.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, If the rejection and dispersion of the Jews were to be in the fourth Monarchy, as is apparent by <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.24. then was their conversion not to be till the beginning of the fifth, and towards the end of the World, as is manifest by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. But the first is true and therefore the latter also.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, the conversion and restauration of the Jews to their antient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances in the holy Land (which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hath so largely described in his twelve last Chapters) and the glorious felicity of the Gospel of Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from their conversion, must either be in the fourth Monarchy, or not untill the fifth. But in the fourth Monarchy it cannot be, for among the <hi>Turks</hi> the Jews are kept in extream slavery, Idolatry and ignorance: and under the Papacy they are not permitted to use the new Testament (by which only they must be saved) and besides they are so inraged against Christianity, by the Papists Image-worship, that there is a flat impossibility (much lesse any hopes) of their conversion, so long as either the Turkish Empire or the Papacy stands in force. <hi>Ergò</hi> their conversion and restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be, till both Turk and Pope eternally be destroyed, and so the fourth Monarchy finally ended.</p>

Of every of which somewhat. It hath fared with <hi>Merlin,</hi> as with <hi>Tostatus</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and many Learned in our times; who for the eminency of their Learning, and approbation of their writings, became so famous, that Pedlar Authors father'd bastar'd ware upon them in every corner for easier vent. <hi>Merlins</hi> there were severall of old; one a Welsh-man in the daies of <hi>Edgar</hi> the Monarch, of an austere li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Monkish conversation.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57195:34"/>
which I have seen of his (some of which I have) I cannot see how they smell any whit of a prophetique spirit; they speak him a great Scholar in Astrology, but no Prophet. But there was living in K. <hi>Lucius</hi> daies another <hi>Merlin</hi> (called the first) a Scottish man, and he is the true <hi>Merlin,</hi> and if any Prophecies could be found of his, great credit was to be given to them. He was a great friend of K. <hi>Lucius</hi> himself, and his daily companion. Of his there is but one Prophecie extant, which I found in that antient Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of <hi>Nennius</hi> of <hi>Bangor</hi> of the <hi>Saxons</hi> (who yet lives in Manuscript) K. <hi>Lucius</hi> being as yet unconverted from Paganisme to Christianity, would needs joyn in confederacy with <hi>Santoline</hi> a King of the <hi>Scutti</hi> (now <hi>Scots</hi>) to raise warre against the Roman Emperour; to which purpose he asked councel of <hi>Merlin</hi> what he should do in this matter; who earnestly dehorted him from his purpose; and in the end prevailed. <hi>Merlin</hi> prophesied to him,

                        </note> The Kingdom of Spain hath alwayes for a matter of 170 years ago by incorporating it self with the House of Austria, and the most potent Families of Germany and Italy by strange Marriages and odde medlies la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured extremely to bring all Europe under her Wings, that so she might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the glorious Sun of the West. On the other side, the Swede of late by keeping an high hand over the King of Poland, and fixing his glorious Trophies of Conquest in all corners of Germany; hath brought the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to so low an ebb, and hath of late become so terrible to the Pope and Spaniard: and lastly can in an instant enleague himself with all Protestant Kingdoms and States, either for fear or favour upon any necessary occasion, that many account him the man that both goeth the directest way, and whom heaven hath ordained to sway the Imperial Scepter within the limits of the Church. But neither of these are they who are ordained to the Empire of the fifth Monarchy. Not the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> because he is for his inhumane cruelty so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hated of Christians, all men avoiding him and flying from him, as the Serpent from the Ash: His Indian Plantations both thrive nor, and likewise for their barbarousnesse are so detested of the savages worse than vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and upon opportunities are accordingly massacred.

Thus is He the universal Odium of all the world, thrives in no place, and like oyl over-swiming all other liquids, and can hardly incorporate with any; so seldom is he conjoyned but in natural Antipathy with all Nations. Adde hereunto the austerity and unpleasantnesse of his Government, chusing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to domineer over subdued Countries by rapine and cruelty, than to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them by Love and Piety. And lastly, his Governours in every Province aim at their own ends, pilling and squeezing the Subjects, so that his Name

and Government is every where abominated, no Province continuing loyal any longer then they can get arms and stoutly rebel. The injustice of which hath caused Portugal to be rent from him, which while the world standeth shall never be his again. And moreover the Oracle tels him, that <hi>Naples, Navar,</hi> his reconciled Provinces in <hi>Belgia,</hi> with his Indian Plantations (the best Jewels he hath) shall be pluckt within 30 years to come from his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Crown, never to be recovered again.</p>
