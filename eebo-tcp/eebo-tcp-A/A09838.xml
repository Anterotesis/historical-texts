            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wee haue heard of before, how he begouth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey against the hypocrisie of the Iewes, who albeit they had the law of God, and gloryed therein; yet were they as greate transgressoures as the Gentiles, who had but the law of Nature, written obscurely in their harts: and so were highlier to be accused then the other. To prooue this
<pb facs="tcp:27593:7"/>
he bringeth in, the euident examples of their liues; being polluted with most grosse sinnes, contrarie the doctrine of the law, which they taught vnto others; namely, of adulterie, thieft, &amp;c. And as to thieft, not being content to accuse them in general; he laieth to their charge (in the wordes now to be intreated) the most hainous kinde thereof, commonlie called Sacrilege: And with that, sharply he discoueres their hypocrisie, where as they would appeare outwardly to keepe some poyntes of the lawe; in the meane time, transgressing against as great heads of the same. For they professed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, <hi>To abhorre Idols,</hi> and Idole ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and yet fostred a great Idole in their hearts, by committing Sacrilege, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by robbing God of his due honour, and thinges belonging to the maintenance of his true seruice. And so, albeit they worshipped not Idols outwardly, yet they offended in the like kinde of sinne, and thereby profaned Gods holy name, which was blasphemed amongst the Gentiles by their occasion, as will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after follow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27593:7"/>And this they did in deede in the daies of PAVLL, not onelie by stealing of God his honour from him, by preferring their owne traditions aboue his holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; and by casting off his due reuerence and feare, which is an high kinde of Sacrilege; but also by their wicked and detestable auarice (which is a kinde of Idolatrie also) they abused Gods true worshipping, esteeming more of the golde of the Temple, nor of the Temple it selfe: And (as our Sauiour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth them) preferring the gift of the Altar, aboue the Altar and offring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yea, this Idole of sacrilegious auarice, was so highlie honored amongst them, that the verie office of the chiefe Priestes was bought and sould for money. And with this there lacked not amongst them such Sacrilegious impietie, as is rebuked by the Prophet MALACHIE, in defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note> the Lorde and his Ministerie of his teindes and dewe offrings, appoynted for the intertainment of his seruice. So the Apostle concludeth most justly, the Iewes aswell as the Gentiles, to be vnder the wrath of God, and that they cannot
<pb facs="tcp:27593:8"/>
be justified by the workes of the lawe, more then the Gentiles, and therefore must needes seeke to the justification of faith in Christ.</p>
            <p>Now (before we proceede further in the matter of justification) because men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is here made especially of sacrilege; seeing the same was, neuer more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant at any time then in this corrupt age; and namelie in this Realme, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the cleare light of the Gospell shining amongst vs: I thinke it both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient &amp; necessarie to make some large discourse thereupon: as a common place most meete to be teached in our daies. For it is marvaile to consider, and hard to be beleued of the godly in other cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; seeing the doctrine of saluation is daily so cleerely beaten in the eares of all estates of this land, with what impudent faces, all sortes of men, and namely they of the greater ranke, being intangled in this crime, advowe their doings, and stande for no admonitions to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte to acknowledge, let bee to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende that filthy fault, whereby the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie worde of God is slandered in their
<pb facs="tcp:27593:8"/>
persones, and they giue ouer-good occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Papistes to raile against the word of truth, who cry out and affirme, that many Princes, Noble-men, Earles and Barronnes, for that cause haue casten off the yoke of the Romane Kirk, that they may the more freely invade and possesse at their pleasure the Kirk goods: Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les they who giue occasion to so greate a slander, shall render a very seuere count vnto God: and the very Heathen that haue decored, and in ignorance bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed largely vpon their Idole seruice, shall stand vp to condemne the sacrilegeous impietie of these men in the latter day.</p>
            <p>Then to enter in the deduction of this matter, I minde first (as the Lord wil assist mee) to declare how diuerslie the name of Sacrilege is taken by writers, and how many kindes thereof there be. Then to take the proper definition of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, and applie it to the purpose and matter, whereupon I am to intreate: And to these whome I account to be sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious amongst vs, which shalbe the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this present Sermon. In the nexte place or Sermon, I am purposed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
<pb facs="tcp:27593:9"/>
&amp; meete the objections, that such men as we call Sacrilegious may vse, and commonly vse for their excuse. And thirdly, in the laste sermon, to declare what punishment the law of God, and also the lawes of men haue appoynted for Sacrilegious persons, with rehearsall of ensamples of extraordinary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments execute by God against such, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well mentioned in the Scriptures, as by profane writers and Histories. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to speake of the blessing of the Lorde bestowed vpon them who did advance his seruice, and contribute liberallie of their substance, for the vp-holding and furthering thereof. So that our exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may tende, if not to prouoke others to the like liberalitie, at least to mooue them to absteine from such vngodly dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as to abstract and greedely apply to their owne profite &amp; particular vses, that which hes bene giuen of others of good zeale (euen in the time of ignorance) to vp-hold the seruice of God, so fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> as the giuers thereof then vnderstoode. The Lord graunt that our proceedings may be to his glorie, and that his worde may
<pb facs="tcp:27593:9"/>
fructifie in our hearts.</p>
            <p>To begin then to explaine what wee cal Sacrilege, I finde the worde taken diuerse waies by writers. For (because the crime properly called Sacrilege, is odious) commonly all haynous offences committed against publicke Lawes of God or man, are named Sacrilegious. As the Poet calles them Sacrilegious handes that murthered CA<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>SAR. The practises of Sorcerers and harlots are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sacriligeous artes. In like maner, the violence done to Parents, Magistrates, or their lawes; and generally all things that ingender publick infamy or slander, may bee so denominate in detestation of the committers thereof. But Sacrilege properly taken, hath respect vnto God, and offenses done against his divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie; either by blaspheming or profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his holy name, or by ascribing his glorie to creatures, or by contempte of his seruice or religion, or by abusing of thinges dedicate to the maintenance thereof: or turning the same to profane vses. And in summe, it comprehendeth al robberie or stealing of holy things, as the
<pb facs="tcp:27593:10"/>
worde it selfe by interpretation beares. Trueth it is, that commonly among the Gentiles (who ascribed all the Majestie and honour of their Gods vnto Idoles) the name of Sacrilege was appropriate to that which was robbed from their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, or taken from their Temples, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into &amp; certaine vaine and superstitious ceremonie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

As the Papistes following the like superstition, commonly count no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacrilege, but the robbing of their relicques, &amp; other rich apparrell of their Temples and Idols. But indeed it is easie to prooue by the Scriptures, and also by best approoued laws of men; that which is properly to be counted Sacrilege, to be more largely extended, then to such a narrow compasse. For besides things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly done against the honor &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie of God (whereof I cease nowe to speake) I finde Sacrilege may be defined to comprehend &amp; conteine vnder it also all robberie, or vnlawfull intrometting, bying, or selling of holy things; as by the ensamples and testimonies following, may be euidently prouen.</p>

            <p>Now if any man would demand what be those holy things, or how far be they extended, whereof we account the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metting to be Sacrilegious: I answer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures. All things se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the common vse of men, whether it be man or beast, or lande of
<pb facs="tcp:27593:11"/>
inheritance, together with all the teinds of the landes and other things destinate for holy vses, are saide to bee <hi>most holy vnto the Lord:</hi> as is expressely conteined in the last Chapter of <hi>Leuiticus:</hi> And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle<note place="margin">Leuit. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if a man would redeeme any there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hee should adde a fift part thereunto. So that he may not lawfully diminish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that thing which hath bin dedicate to an holy vse. As also by the sacred co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutiones of Emperours &amp; Princes, such things cannot be annalied nor ingaged, vnlesse it be in great necessitie: as for the relief of the poore or captiues: for al these holy things are said to be in no mans pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, but to appertein to God his right. So vnder the name of holy thinges are to be included, first all thinges that bee holy of their owne nature, as are the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall giftes of God bestowed vpon his Kirke, which SIMON the sorcerer would haue bought: And generallie, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer perteineth immediatly to the glory
<pb facs="tcp:27593:12"/>
and honour of Gods holy Majestie. Of the which sorte are the holy Scriptures and doctrine conteined therein, the which to violate is most haynous Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; so as IOHN testifieth in the end of the Revelation, whosoeuer adde anie thing thereto, God shall adde against him the plagues written in the booke: &amp; whosoeuer taketh any thing there-fra, God shal take &amp; rase out his name out of the book of life. From the which kinde of Sacrilege, the Papistes of our daies cannot bee excused, who haue falsifyed the writings of the auncient Fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning the Scriptures: either by fathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them such works as they neuer writ, or by adding, altering, or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing their sayings, to foster &amp; mainteine corrupt doctrine: And namely, by that Treatise lately come to light, which they cal <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> wherin they note all such places as make against their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition: and will haue all Imprenters of bookes, whom they may commande, to delete and omitte all such sentences, as they haue thought meete to be razed out of these workes. Of this sorte are also
<pb facs="tcp:27593:12"/>
they who apply the Scriptures to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and profane vses, as to diuilish sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie &amp; charmes, or to Idolatrie, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane jesting and mockage. In this firste ranke also, are to be counted the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christ annexed to the worde, which in like manner haue bene corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Papistes, ministring them without doctrine, and adding thereto many superstitious rites of their owne inuentions.</p>
            <p>Nexte, in the second order of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, wee place the violence done to the Ministers of God, either in their bodies or in their office, who are called holy in respect of their function.

to that charge. For they are ane chiefe parte of the Holie Temple of God, which may be highly violated, if violence be done to them in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or in their office. In the third roome are to be placed things dedicate to the holy seruice of GOD, for maintenance thereof, such as are the Teindes, Landes, and possessiones appoynted for that vse. For although they of themselues in their owne nature may bee counted commoun and profane, like to others earthlie possessiones; yet in so farre as they are annexed to holy vses, and can not bee separate with-out the decaye thereof, they may well bee called, and ought to bee repute holy. So it may bee well concluded, that who-so-euer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade or vsurpe vnlawfully, any of such holy thinges, therein committes Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. Concerning the which Sacrilege, because it is most common in this Land, and yet holden by many no great sinne, but rather a lawfull conquest, to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate such thinges to mennes priuate vses. I minde specially to inciste and make some large discourse, not onelie in
<pb facs="tcp:27593:13"/>
this dayes Sermon, but (if God graunte me hability) the two Sabboth-daies here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after following.</p>
            <p>To enter then to speake more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie<note place="margin">17. Q. 4. Quisqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
               </note> of this laste kinde of Sacrilege, I finde it to bee diuided in the auncient Cannons in three sorts; to witte, when thinges called holie, either are taken out of an holie place, or holy thinges out of a profane place, or thinges not holy out of an holy place. Al-be-it some Ciuill Lawes call it not Sacrilege but thieft, to take priuate mennes goodes out of a Sanctuarie or holie place. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, to speake according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wee may gather by examples thereof, all these three kindes to bee counted as Sacrilege: For al-be-it the name of Sacrilege be rarely founde in the Bible, and peraduenture not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in all the Olde Testamente; yet it is alike, if we finde the equivalente there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as when medling with Holie or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate thinges, is called in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <hi>Hherem</hi> or spoyling of GOD, for the which hee pronounceth a curse
<pb facs="tcp:27593:14"/>
vpon the dooers thereof. As when NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BVCHADNETZAR spoyled the holy ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and other plenishing out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in Ierusalem, al-be-it that plague come of the Lord, yet no doubte he committed a great sacrilege, by taking of these holy things out of an holy place. Which made CYRVS (although he was an Heathen King) hauing some sponke of Religion, to send these vesselles againe to the house of God. Also, to prooue it to be Sacrilege to take away holy things, al-be-it not out of an holy place or Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarie, the ensamples before adduced sufficiently prooue. As to the thirde, the treasures layde vp in the Temple of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem by priuate persons, and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way first by IOAS King of <hi>Israell,</hi> and thereafter invaded by HELIODORVS at<note place="margin">2 King. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The plague wherewith HELIODORVS was smitten, may well ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie it to be trueth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27593:14"/>But as to these two sortes of sacrilege, to wit, to robbe &amp; take away holy things out of an holy place; or vnholy things out of an holy place, we need not in this corruptage to vexe our selfs much ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. For who wil now commit any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to be kept in Kirkes, seeing the most part of them be as open as the Kirk-stile, as wee vse to speake. And to robbe any thing out of them, it will not in-rich the sacrilegious, vnlesse it bee some poore thiefe for necessitie, to rob a peece of a benke or window-bands, or such trifles. Therefore it is the second kinde of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege that we haue to intreate of, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the rich sacrilegious thieues, who meddle not with small matters, but with landes, teindes, and great possessions, not regarding in what place things dedicate to the holy seruice of God be founde, so they may catch &amp; apprehend them. And first this I gather for a good ground, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which hath bin already spoken, that al they who appropriat to their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate vses, the patrimonie and rents of the Kirk, defrauding thereby, &amp; disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Ministrie, the schooles, and the
<pb facs="tcp:27593:15"/>
poore, of that which should justlye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to them, are to be holden sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And consequently, that there be mo sacrilegious in <hi>Scotland</hi> (considering the quantitie and reuenues thereof) then in any other countrie, that hath embraced the true light of the Gospell of Iesus Christ. Whereof almost all men amongst vs will bee called professours; but in that poynte, not a fewe number are become transgressoures.</p>
            <p>Then to compare time with time, &amp; our estate with the estate of the people of the Iewes; wee may vnderstande and perceiue, as in the daies of PAVLL, when he wrote this Epistle, the Iewish people were ridde of externall Idolatrie, hauing their Temple purged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pollution of the Gentiles; &amp; hauing liberty graunted vnto them to vse and exercise their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: So hes the Lord deliuered vs of his mercie from the Papisticall Idolatrie, &amp; our Temples from their superstition: yea and freede vs from the tyranny of them that helde vs in the thraldome of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Yea, (I say) our estate hath bene far better in this behalfe, then that of the
<pb facs="tcp:27593:15"/>
Iewes. For as to them, although they had an outward face of Religion, purged from externall Idolatrie; yet the doctrine of God his law, was in many chief points corrupted, by false and wrong wresting and exponing thereof, by the Scribes &amp; Pharisees, and others pretending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be Doctors thereof. Whereas, (praise be to God) since the first reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of religion amongst vs, the poore doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Gospel hath bene continued in ane estate, without anye substantiall poynte of errour, with discipline agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto. And whatsoeuer hath bin cast in by Satan to disturbe the same, the Lorde hath not suffred him hitherto to preuaile. But as the byers &amp; sellers were not cast out of the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> albeit Christ with his whippe preassed diuerse times to expel them: So for al the crying out and preaching of the faithful messengers of God, with threatnings v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against such persones; yet they cease not, bur adde daylie more and more, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well they of the nobilitie, as others fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their ensample, to robbe, spoyle, buye, conquest &amp; occupy the kirk-rents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27593:16"/>Herefore, if the Iewes might justly be accused by the Apostle, who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to haue a bare knowledge of the Law of God, liued no better then they that lacked a law: How much more we, who bragge of a sincere knowledge of the Gospell, as being needfull to order our liues thereby; not onely liue other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise licenciously, but also many amongst vs (so far as in vs lyeth) stoppe and hinder the propagation of the kingdome of Christ: In so farre, that they holde him a man of no accounte, hauing any power in these corrupted dayes, who hath not polluted his handes with some spoyle of the Kirk-goods. And as to the doctrine of the worde, it is so become loathsome to these men, that if they heare it, they heare it with deafe eares, &amp; are no more mooued at the rebuke of this their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious dealing, nor if they were stupide blockes or Idols, without al sense of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. For they cease not still to maintaine and advance this detestable sinne: And daylie inuente new practises and colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red titles of the law, to augment and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the same, both in hearte and deede<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:27593:16"/>
Notwithstanding that such deuourers of Christ his patrimonie are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reckoned by the godly Fathers, to be murtherers of the poore: for it is a certaine kinde of murther indeed.</p>
            <p>And to this purpose, I will here cite certaine of the authorities of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes, that it may bee knowne how odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous this sinne of Sacrilege was in their eies.

And further he saieth, the sacrilegious holde one of three thinges, either that God is not, or that he regardeth not the thinges done by men; or at leaste, wilbe easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, when such impietie is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with sacrifices, and such ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as were vsed amongst the Gentiles.</p>

The beginning indeede was small in respect of the increase: For at the first reformation of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, they who tooke the worke in

Yet a great many, not onely of the raskall sorte, but sundry men of name and worldly reputation, joyned themselues with the congregation of the reformers, not so much for zeale of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as to reape some earthly commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, and to be inriched by spoyle of the Kirkes and Abbey places. And when the Preachers told them that such places of Idolatrie should be pulled downe, they accepted gladly the enterprise; &amp; rudely passing to worke, pulled down all both Idoles &amp; places where they were found. Not making difference betweene these places of Idolatrie, and many Parish-Kirks, where Gods word shuld haue bin preached in many parts where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted, as in such tumultes and suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties vseth to come to passe, namelye, among such a nation as we are.

Nowe albeit, they were frustrate of their expectation, yet their intention being to appropriate the Kirk rentes to their own vse, they cannot be excused at leaste of a sacrilegious meaning.</p>
            <p>An other thing fell out at that time, which may be excused by reason of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, when as the Lordes, and some of the Nobilitie, principall enterprysers, of the reformation, hauing to doe with the <hi>French</hi> men, and many their assisters of our owne Nation enemies to these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, were forced not onely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their owne landes, and bestowe whatsoeuer they were able to furnish of their owne patrimonie, for maintenance of men of warre, and other charges, but

For in like cases wee finde examples in the Scriptures, how things dedicated e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the true seruice of God, for neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities cause, were distracted and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to stay the fury of enemies, not onely by such Kinges as had made defection from the puritie of Religion, but also by one of the most godly Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZECHIAS by name, who gaue to the king of <hi>Ashur, to pacifie his inuasion, not onely all the money that was founde in the house of the</hi>

And in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that God was offended with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, making the spoile of the kirk to cleaue to their hands; it was shortly sene, that the Lorde blew so vpon it, that it vanished away from the most part of them.

            <p>But all this was of small accounte, in respect of that which after hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and dayly falleth out in this vnruly common-wealth.

I speake the more earnestly, because I feare there be some amongst you, that will rather pay your teindes and duties, to such idle bellies, as deuoure vp the sweat of your browes &amp; your seruantes, for nothing doing to your commodity, nor to them that labour in the vine-yaird of the Lord, &amp; others to whom the same ought justly to perteine.

taking the argument from the lesse to the more, that we must needes confesse it to bee a greater sacrilege, to take from the Kirk a barrony of lande, or the teinde of a whole Parish Kirk, being of the valure of many chalders of victuall, nor a little thing, as a Silver cuppe or chalice out of a Sanctuarie or materiall Kirk. For the greater the thieft or spoyle of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing bee, it is the greater Sacrilege. And as to the place out of the which the holy thing is taken, it makes not much to the matter in the law of conscience. But to put it out of doubt, that this kinde of spoyling the Kirk, and defrauding of her right; by the worde of God is properly to be called sacrilege: No man can deny but to spoyle God is sacrilege. Now the Prophet MALACHIE prooueth against the Iewes of his dayes, that they spoyled God, <hi>Because they defrauded him of his</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:27593:27"/>
priuate man is a great offense: how can they then deny, that to spoyle or steale from God things dedicate to his seruice, is a more high and haynous transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cannot be more properlie tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by any name then Sacrilege.</p>
            <p>But yet these men will alleage, that the authorities cited out of the Olde Testament, to prooue our purpose serue not sufficiently to that effect. For, albeit in the Leviticall or Ceremoniall law of MOYSES, not onely the teindes, but also the landes given to the sustentation of the Priestes and Levites, were separate from the common vse of men, and called Holy; yet that law being abrogate, or at the least ceasing and taking end, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance thereof being accomplished in Christ, wee are no further bounde to the obseruation thereof. Therfore, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that law, concerning ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, ought not now to haue place, neither concerning the teindes, which are not nowe add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:27593:27"/>
Kirke in time of Papistrie, the which nowe cease to bee of that nature, to bee esteemed holy. First, before I aunswere, I am well contented there be a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made betweene the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>andes and Teindes, leauing off to speake of the teindes till afterwardes. Then I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere concerning these Landes or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall rentes, out of Landes delated and giuen to the Kirke, that although the Leviticall Lawe, with the Ceremonies thereof, concerning the outwarde ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation hath taken an ende, and is fulfilled in Christ; yet the substance of the policie, concerning interteinement of the seruice of God, and vp-hold of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion still remaines. And it is no lesse necessarie, that the ministerie of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs be mainteined; and that suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prouision be made to serue other Godlie vses, where-unto the Kirke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes ought to be applyed nor it was, that the Priestes and Leuites shoulde bene vp-holden in the time of the Olde law. And as to the holinesse or vnholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of these landes and reuenues: albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it in their owne nature (as I saide in the
<pb facs="tcp:27593:28"/>
former sermon) they be like other earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly possessiones; yet in so far as they were applyed to an holy vse, they may wel be called holy possessions and rents, as the Kirk is holy, to whose vse they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. Then I say, the end and firste cause wherefore these landes and rentes were giuen, being therewith to vp-hold the holy seruice of God, a like thing in substance, aswell in the Euangelical, as in the Leviticall Lawe; and the same being separate, dedicate, and mortified (as the Law speaketh) to that holy vse, it can no more be lawful to abstract the same from godly vses, then it was in time of the Olde law, the Ministers of the word not being otherwaies sufficiently provided, nor other godly vses for maintenance of religion, and of the poore members of Christ, being duely considered and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
            <p>But yet they may make instance and say, that the gift of thinges bestowed to to the Kirk of old, by our fore-fathers in superstition, was for a certaine cause, to wit, to pray for the Dead, say Messe, and do other superstitious &amp; Idolatrous ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb facs="tcp:27593:28"/>
which nowe is not to be vsed. And therefore the cause ceasing, the effect should also cease: And consequently, things giuen for such abuses should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the giuers or their aires, or at least to the Prince to be otherwaies em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. As to that theorike of the Law, the cause ceasing, the effect ceases (giuing it to be true) I aunswere with a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Lawiers themselues make, that thereby, two kind of causes ar to be considered in thinges, to wit, the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue cause (as they call it) and the finall cause. Now, albeit it be true, that the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cause ceasing, the effect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses also. Yet it is not so in the impulsiue cause, which al though it ceasis, it makes not the effect of the finall cause, which is the principall intention to cease. But so it is in this case. For albeit it may stand, that one of the causes that mooued zealous men in time of blindnes, to giue diuerse things to the Kirk, and to places then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led religious, was to pray for the dead, and to do other superstitious seruie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:27593:29"/>
were valiable to deliuer soules out of Purgatorie, which may be called the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsiue or moouing cause: Yet the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall &amp; finall cause was (no doubt) that they minded to serue God thereby. For if they had not beleeued that these their gifts were to be applyed to the seruice of God, and godly vses, they would never haue bestowed any of their substance, rentes, or lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es, to any Kirk or religious place: That this is true; It is manifest by their euidents, fundations, and charters, made vpon such donations, in the words dispositiue, euer bearing this clause, <hi>Deo &amp; Ecclesiae,</hi> to God and his Kirke, before they make mention of any Saint, place, or other vse, whereto the same was to be applyed. Nowe, seeing all these gifts are so giuen, it is reason that God being first named in the Charters, haue the firste place, as beste and worthiest, and as the principall receiuer of these donationes, which are nothing else but a small por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne, which hee before hath giuen vnto them.

But in the same, in that case, if the cause wherfore they were giuen be not a good cause, these gifts are to be applyed to more godly vses, &amp; not profane vses, according to that common rule of the law, <hi>quod semel Deo dicat est deo, &amp;c.</hi> The things once dedicat to God may not therafter be applyed to profane vses, without great necessity, as for redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of captiues, or other like cases.

<pb facs="tcp:27593:30"/>
vppon an other lawfull vse. And as these lawes conteine great equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so were they well practised in the dayes of AVGVTTINE. For when the Magistrates did take from the Donatistes their possessiones, which they had of the Kirke, and they complayned and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that none should be depriued of their reuenues; for dissention of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones cause. That holy Father answered, that these goodes perteined to the Kirk, and therefore being rightly taken from them, who had made a separation from the Kirk, the same should be applyed to other Godly vses of the Kirk. As to the Princes part in these matters, wee shall speake (God willing hereafter) But yet to aunswere further to these men, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that their predecessoures (as they say) gaue such landes and rentes vnto the Kirke, in blinde zeale, and so they haue reason to take the same againe. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent or assumption of this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, albeit it were admitted to them to proue, I suppose it should remaine vnprouen by a great many of them, who are most gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to invade the Kirk-rentes nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes. For such as they be readier (as the
<pb facs="tcp:27593:30"/>
Proverbe saith) to eate the Kirk-loafe, then to giue it. Yet supposing it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, it is of no force to serue their turne, neither doth the consequent fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereupon. For although they, or their antecessors had giuen such thinges to the Kirk, by what reason should they take the same againe at their pleasure? For what is freer then gift? or what is more vnhonest and against humanitie, then to take the gift againe being once freely disponed? supposing it were giuen to a priuate man, whereof he had broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked long possession. Howe much more shameles and vnhonest were it to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to take it againe by force. Then by stronger reason should this be thought vnlawfull, concerning things giuen to God and his Kirk, which (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sheweth) <hi>cannot be redeemed again, but</hi>

among the Mystical politick lawes, yet the substance thereof (as was proved before) remaines, to wit, the lawe ought not to defraude God &amp; his Kirk of their duetie. To the which purpose, yet let vs heare what AMBROSE (a godly father) speaketh of such men, as would cal back againe that which they haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the vse of the Kirk. There be some (saith he) who after they haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their goods to the kirk, rashly think to revoke the same, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nether the former gift deserueth thanks, nor the latter doing is allowable.

<pb facs="tcp:27593:31"/>
not to proceede to the doinge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or else haste to performe it: Not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding his purpose by any craftie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his irreligious minde: &amp; so much the more this ought he to take heed to, if the gift be depute to godly vses or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, least he be found not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly void of religion, but also vngodly. And so be subject not onely to the penalty of the law, but also to punishmente from heauen. And notwithstanding, not only he, but also his successors in this case shal be compelled to restore that which they haue taken &amp; wit-holden, with the rest that followes. To the same purpose it is is said in another law, written in the same title of <hi>Donationes,</hi> speaking of things gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by mens predecessors, that it availeth nothing to say such things perteined to our progenitors, after that the right and donation thereof is deuolved to others.</p>
            <p>Yet to beamfill their first argument, these men may alleage &amp; say, that things dedicate to the kirk in Papistrie, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat to Idolatry; which was not only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, but also abominable before God, &amp; conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the lands &amp; rents so dedicat
<pb facs="tcp:27593:32"/>
can no waies be called holy, and so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly would infer, they ought not to be applyed to the holy seruice of God, but rather to profane vses. This argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they see not how much it makes against themselues. For if these things offred to idole seruice be abhominable, why bring they abhomination into their houses? &amp; so procure a curse against themselues.

And as to that allegeance, that thinges dedicate to Idolatrous seruice, if they be abhominable, how can they bee applyed to the seruice of God, in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Kirke, being abhominable in themselues?

               </gap>mselues. The Kirk-rentes, (say they) namely, the first kirk-lands, for the most parte were giuen by Kinges, his majesties predecessors, mooved of blind
<pb facs="tcp:27593:33"/>
zeale to the Kirk, in time of Papistrie (for such abuses ar now abolished) to abbaies principally, &amp; other places called religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to pray for the dead, sing &amp; say Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, &amp; to vse other their superstitious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The which landes &amp; rents so giuen, haue greatly hurte &amp; diminished the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of the crown. Therfore the king with advise of his estates in Parliament, hes called in &amp; revoked these donations, namely, of lands, &amp; taken them againe to his Hienes own patrimonie &amp; dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And we againe, haue obteined some of these lands, erected to vs &amp; our aires by liberality of the Prince in temporal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings or lordships. And so we possesse the same justly by our lawful titles, therfore we ought not to be rayled on, nor called Sacrilegious possessors. I answere simply (not for offence of any, but to vtter the trueth) that I judge these kinde of erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones, or whatsoeuer new required titles by such meanes that the possessours can pretende, to bee altogether vnlawfull. But this question requires greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration: which standeth in two heads. The one is, what entereste the Prince
<pb facs="tcp:27593:34"/>
hes, or may justly pretend in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal liuings. The other, what right or title thereof, he may dispone vnto others. As to the former of these two heads (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence of the Prince I speake) who is prejudged by this kinde of dealing, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as the Kirke: I say, that Kinges in so farre as they be called, <hi>nurishing Fathers of the Kirke,</hi> they ought to see sufficient prouision bee made for vp-holding the seruice thereof. And the Kirk againe, to bestow al dutie for furthering the Prince in the publick affaires of the common wealth.

And the schooles and the poore (who ought not to bee neglected) well seene to, it cannot stande with good conscience, law, divine nor humane.</p>
            <p>Therefore I saye (albeit these men alleage the Kirke-rents to be ouer-great) to begin at the spoyle of the Kirke, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not being done, is a very preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous<note place="margin">1.

If they will giue instance of our neighbour cuntrie, there is no comparison; for they that serue in the Kirks there, at least are all wel provided of liuings: But they will reply; The Parliament &amp; estates agreed to take these Kirk-landes: Therefore it ought to stande as a law, and it is not now time to dispute nor reason thereupon. But howe many acts of Parliament (I pray you) are oftentimes againe called &amp; annulled by contrarie actes. And how can they bee annalyed or bought, vake (vnles they be

<pb facs="tcp:27593:37"/>
him or his Predecessors. And in the acts of Parliament, both ancient and recent, commonly the first acte is, that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and freedomes of the Kirke be keiped. And how can these liberties be but hurte, when the Patrimonie of the kirk is taken awaie, and giuen to profane men &amp; profane vses? Now, to come in particular, to these new erectiones, and new found infeftmentes of Kirk-Lands, they are (as I vnderstande) of two sortes. For some are giuen before the annexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to the Crowne, and some thereafter. As to the former, I woulde know by what law or reason they could be giuen by a simple gifte of the Prince, they being not yet come in his handes, and the consent of the true Kirke, neuer had thereto? For, as to the consent of Abbots and Bishoppes, being the moste parte of the Papisticall promotion, and chiefe wrackers of the Kirke, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> hauing any commission from the true reformed Kirke, it cannot bee of any force in this case, to defraude the Kirke of her Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. And albeit, the whole Kirke had consented, their consente could not bee
<pb facs="tcp:27593:37"/>
sufficient to dilapidat or annaly the Kirk Lands in propertie to any person, they being themseues onely vsufructuares, and not proprietares thereof. And as to the Princes parte, can he take any priuate mans heritage from him, and giue it to whome hee pleaseth, without consent of partie, or fore faltrie? I think all men will say no. Much lesse then, may he dispone these lands from God and his Kirk, by sik simple donationes. As to the other sorte of infeftmentes or erectiones giuen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the annexation, they can be no better in effect, for giuing only for arguments cause, that these lands were lawfullie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Crown; whereuppon I wil not now farther dispute. I say, the King cannot by the Lawes of his Realme, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spone the same againe from the crowne, they being once annexed therto. Reade the 43. acte of King IAMES the seconde, the 86. of King IAMES the Thirde, the 24. of King IAMES the Fourth, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his Revocation, acte 83. As also the 4. and 54. of King IAMES the Fifth: with others, tending to the like purpose. Yea, they would make our Kinges Majestie
<pb facs="tcp:27593:38"/>
that now is, bee involved in <hi>periurie</hi> by these dispositiones, it being expresse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his oath, made at his Hienes coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and inacted amongst the acts of Parliamente. The time straites me, that I cannot insist longer vpon this head.</p>
            <p>Before I speake of the teindes, I come to the finall reason, or rather excuse that robbers of the Kirk pretend for them to colour their Sacrilege. The landes, with the other rents of the kirk (say they) giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to it in time of Papistrie, ar ouer-large, &amp; more then sufficient, for the necessary vses of the Kirk that now is. For, as to the Ministers, what should they haue but their necessary sustentation, with an gray gowne, to go vpon their feete Preaching from place to place, as the Apostles did? They are as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eedie as the Papistes; with many other like tearms of their reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Rethoricke. And why may not the King (say they) giue these landes to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men, Gentle-men, and others, able to serue his Majestie; the teindes being more then sufficiente to susteine all the charges of the Kirke. As to the estate of the Ministers, it is no marvell that they
<pb facs="tcp:27593:38"/>
who care for no Religion, but so far as it serues their turne, would wel vouch safe to see them poore, that they might goe the lighter to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, following the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of IVLIAN the Apostate, or rather IVDAS the traytour, who envyed for the oyntmente that was bestowed vppon Christ, because hee was a Sacrilegious thiefe, and would haue had the price thereof to his owne vse. Would these men commend vnto vs such poverty, as Christ did to the poore in Spirite, or if necessitie required, to loose all thinges for his names sake, they should doe well. But seeing they labour so farre as they may, to bring Ministers in contempt, &amp; consequently, to depriue the people of the doctrine of Saluation, we cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their vngodly devises: For wee haue sufficiente warrant in the word of God, that the labourers in this function, are worthye of their wages; not onely for the honeste intertenemente of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but also of their wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and families, and for hospitalitie. Which things being ministred vnto vs, for our owne partes, wee would be well
<pb facs="tcp:27593:39"/>
contented, so that none of vs did lacke, as it was in the Primitiue Kirke, providing not the lesse, that the reste of godly vses belonging to the Kirk, were not neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And speciallie, the schooles and the poore: whose large portion ought to be comprehended therein, seeing the Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes were justly called, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>he Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the poore. As to the reste (this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done) we might well agree, it should supplie the necessarye affaires of the Prince, and the Realme, and such other Godly vses as the worlde allowes. And the ensample of former ages agreeable thereto haue practized. But the abuses we cannot allow, as that of the Papistes, of defrauding the poore of that parte of the Kirkes Patrimonie, which should be bestowed vpon them.</p>
            <p>Wee knowe that the Kirk-rentes of olde were divided in foure partes. The one parte thereof was bestowed vppon the Pastour or Bishoppe for his owne vse, and for vp-holding of hospitalitie. An other, vppon the reste of the office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, in the Kirke (called the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.) The thirde, vppon the Poore.
<pb facs="tcp:27593:39"/>
And the fourth and laste parte, vppon the interteinemente of Kirkes, Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talles, Brigges, and other publicke and Godlie affaires: Whereinto, the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the Prince, and publicke affaires of the Countrie are to be also conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But the degenerate posteritie of the Antichristiane Kingdome, applyed all these goodes, to the interteinement of idle bellies, diuiding all the Kirkes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, into Prelacies, and benefices, &amp; in erection of Abbaies &amp; Cloisteres, such as are not to be found in the booke of God, nor in any ensample of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Kirke, and such as ought to haue no place in any reformed Kirke or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. And yet this corruption re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth amongst vs, by distributing of newe titles, not onely to the Bishoppes, but also to Abbottes, and newe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates (as they call them) after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the olde Papisticall promotion. The affaires of the true Kirke, in the meane time, not being duelie seene to nor provided. And as concerning benefices vnder Prelacies, there is a newe craftie and fradulente inuention
<pb facs="tcp:27593:40"/>
founde out, that these greedie gorman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des haue procured at the Princes hands, gifts of the Patronages therof: therby to defraude best qualifyed Ministers of the same, to giue them, or rather sel them to whom they can finde out, who wil be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make vnlawful paction with them, to take a little portion of the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (serue as they please) and let the moste parte remaine with themselues, either by setting of vnlawfull tacks, or by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fraudulent way.</p>
            <p>Now, concerning the teinds (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I promised laste to speake) I graunt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, if they were rightly gathered and bestowed to the right vse, they would both helpe the poore labourers of the grounde, and serue to many good vses in the Kirkes affaires. But as things nowe go amongst vs, they are little more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to these vses, then the Kirk lands. For they who wrongfully haue invaded the landes, marke as greedely for the teinds: and are entred already in possession of the greatest part thereof. And now begin to make question, what title or right the Kirke hath thereto: So insatiable is the
<pb facs="tcp:27593:40"/>
greede of them who haue once made shippe-wrack of conscience, that they would Crucifie Christ againe for his coate. Herefore it is expedient, as short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of time will now serue vs, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from the originall, the payment of teindes.

As to the
<pb facs="tcp:27593:41"/>
offringe and paying of teindes vnder the Law, we neede to make no question, for the same is so set foorth at length, in the bookes of the Law of MOYSES, that the adversaries can make no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against it.

Read the place. Deu. 26.</p>
            <p>It restes to declare then, what hath bin the vse concerning teinds, vnder the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel amongst Christians. Certainely the vse of payment thereof hath bin so anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb facs="tcp:27593:41"/>
that it is difficil to finde out the firste original thereof. Alwaies it appeareth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently, that godly Princes &amp; common wealths, being willing to provide the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, &amp; other godly affaires of the Kirk, of competent living &amp; revenues, did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choose the teindes, then any other meanes to that effect; following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the godly before the lawe, and imitating the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of God, vnder the Lawe. Which loueable vse and custome, hath remayned through many ages (I thinke) inuiolably obserued in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiane kingdomes &amp; common-wealthes. For it is more then a thousand yeares by. paste, since the payment of teinds vnder the Gospell, was called an auncient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, which the Christians had obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by common consente, by ayplying<note place="margin">Concil.

So that I can not marvaile ynough of a certaine man, who held himself very wel beseen in the laws &amp; customs of the cuntry, who was not ashamed to affirm, that the paime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of

Did statute by lawe, that the teindes of all that grew vpon the grounde, should be brought in vnto the Priests, and service of God, vsed in these daies, which from that time by long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription hath bene obserued amongst this our Scottish Nation. So that the question cannot nowe haue place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the teindes perteine to the Kirke or not; I will not deny but the teinds might be possibly changed, in other meanes of sufficient provision for the Kirke, if such godly zeale were nowe amongst men, as was of olde time. But in so farre as we see the plain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, that men are now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to take away, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer our predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors were to giue; it were a foolish thing to loose the certaine for the vncertaine, and that which is neuer likely to come to passe. And the wisedome of the fathers, hes done better in this behalfe, then any

thing that wee can nowe deuise or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. Therefore, whosoeuer now doe abstracte the teindes from that vse; for the which they haue bene of so auncient time appoynted amongst Christians, they are to be repute as violaters of that godly and publick order, and good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of Christian common-wealths and cannot be excused from Sacrilege.</p>
            <p>Because time hasteth me to an ende, I am compelled for the present to cut ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges. Therefore I come shortly to the laste refuge of these Kirk-robbers, whereas they alleage for themselues, their titles, tacks, and assedations, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other evidentes &amp; rights, whereby they possesse and brooke the teindes.

<pb facs="tcp:27593:43"/>
for the moste parte are set contrarie to the common Lawe, and so are null in themselues. And if wee shall examine them by the Lawe of Conscience, which is the chiefe Lawe that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians ought to liue by; it will be harde to purge the taker and also the setter of Sacrilege. The first cause that mooued<note place="margin">Concil. Carthag, 5 cap. 6.</note> them of the Kirke to let teindes in tackes, was to defende them from the invasion and violence of such mightie robbers, as spoyled them of their possessions. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, it was not lawfull in any case by their Cannones, that any of them, (whome they called the Laick sorte) should haue any medling therewith. But now it falles out plain contrariwise, that none doe greater hurte to the Kirk, then those tackesmen, to make their own gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die gaine of the Kirk-goods. And they may wel be compared to manchpresents (as we speake) taking to themselues the best parte, &amp; leauing the least portion to the Kirks vse. So I say, that none of them that take the teindes in assedation, with euident diminution of the olde rentals can pretende, but they greatly hurte the
<pb facs="tcp:27593:43"/>
Kirke, contrary to good lawes &amp; consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Yea, many of their tacks are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within the halfe of the just availe; but oftentimes within the tent part, as victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als now are solde.</p>
            <p>For colouring of the which, there is a new fraud of the law devised, by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting victuall into money, vnknowne to our Fore-bearers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because (say they) v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereto should I insiste longer vppon the newe mainteined corruptiones of this age, to defraude the Kirke of her due right? It shoulde weary both mee to rehearse, and you to heare it.

<pb facs="tcp:27593:44"/>
three nintene years, with three life-rents, all in one tacke, is thought nothing. Yea, many make heritage of the teindes, as they haue done of the landes.

As to the kindnesse, which these men alleage, because it is of no force in the Lawe, I cease likewise to speake thereof.

Nowe it resteth to bee declared, what daungers such Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious persones stande into, and what punishment they be worthie of, who are gyltie of that crime: Aswell by the Lawe of God, as by humane and Civill Lawes. And if they will not amend for feare of these punishmentes, appoynted by good Lawes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because Magistrates in that parte doe not their office, and the law lacks execution in this corrupted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.

For the which purpose, I shall God-willing, bring forth
<pb facs="tcp:27593:45"/>
ensamples, both of the divine historie and of profane writers; declaring howe the wrath of God fell vpon such kinde of men from time to time: And how by the contrarie, the blessing of the Lorde hath continually bene with them, who travelled carefully to buyld Gods house, and to bestowe liberally of the goodes which hee gaue them vpon his seruice and servants.</p>
            <p>Firste, then to beginne with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishmentes appoynted and threatned by Gods Lawe, againste the Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. In Deuteronomie wee finde it written, that all they who meddle with thinges dedicate to Religion (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it bee Idoles service) and applie the same to their private commoditie, are to bee counted <hi>Anathema;</hi> that is, accursed of GOD, both they and the thinges, which they by such meanes appropriate vnto themselues. <hi>Bring not</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:27593:46"/>
               <hi>Lorde thy GOD: Therefore thou shall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre it, because it is accursed, leaste thou bringing the abhominable thing in thine house be accursed, as it is.</hi> Nowe, that the like curse falleth vpon them that take or with-holde the holy thinges, dedicate to the seruice of the Lorde; it is manifest in the Prophet MALACHIE, a good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter<note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note> of the Law. By whom, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning vpon the Sacrilegious people of Israel in his daies, saith; <hi>Ye are accursed with a curse, because ye haue spoyled me.</hi> And they demanded (as such men are euer quarrelous) <hi>wherein they had spoyled him: he answereth, in his teindes and offrings.</hi> And before a little he had saide. <hi>Will any man spoyle his gods?</hi> Whereby he declared, that it was a rare thing (which is moste fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in our dayes) euen among Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to commit Sacrilege. So we see the curse is common, both vppon them that defraude the Lorde of holy things dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to his seruice, and them that appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to themselues thinges dedicate to Idols. Moreouer, we finde Sacrilege pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with death, in the person of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Yet, men may say, this was a politicke Law, giuen for a time vnto the people of Israell onely. But, giuing it so be, yet it serueth to our purpose, to proue what punishment hath bene statute in the law of God against Sacrilegious persones, who so highlie provoked the wrath of God, not onely against themselues, but against the whole people, if they suffred
<pb facs="tcp:27593:47"/>
such impietie amongste them vn-puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: as this example of ACHAN decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And let vs come to the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we shal perceiue the Lords wrath, not yet to be quenched against such per sons: Consider our text, doth not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle here, comparing Sacrilege with Idolatrie, declare that the Iewes, aswel as the Gentiles were vnder the wrath of God for this crime in special? And if we thinke the punishmente greate that fell vpon ACHAN and his familie: What lesse was that which PETER executed vppon<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> ANANIAS &amp; SAPPHIRA for the like, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther les offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? wer they not both severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dung dead at an insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And albeit, that was an extraordinary punishment, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect be had to the person of PETER; yet non can deny but it was justly deserved: Otherwise PETER had bene to blame in the execution thereof: whom the Spirit of God doth alwaies allow. Herefore, it avayleth not to extenuate this crime, and the punishment thereof, as that it were not so to be agreged, nor so seuerly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder the lawe of the Gospell, as it
<pb facs="tcp:27593:47"/>
was in the Lawe of MOYSES. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Christian Magistrates, be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted to followe the pollicie of that Law in all poynts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet Sacrilege is ay Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege. And very sharp lawes hath bene made for punishment thereof, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Christian Princes and Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, but also by the Heathen Princes and law-giuers, in their natural zeale and light.</p>
            <p>But let vs first come to Ecclesiasticall Cannons &amp; lawes (I meane not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof it is easie to alleage an innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) but the ancient Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nons of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles; and the writes of godlie Fathers of the Kirke, agreeable to the Scriptures. The greatest punishment the Kirke hath to vse ordinarily, against all disobedient persones, according to Ecclesiasticall discipline, is Excommunication. For wee haue not to followe the Papistes, in exceeding the boundes of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical jurisdiction, by imposing corporall punishment, and pecuniall paines to the offenders, such as belong to the Civill Magistr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t. So, I say, Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, but
<pb facs="tcp:27593:48"/>
excommunication in the highest, and most seuere sorte, was appoynted by the Cannons and Discipline of the Kirke, against the Sacrilegious. For (we know) there were two kindes of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; the one called the lesse, which was, debarring from the Sacraments of the Kirke; the other the greater, which was a cutting off from the whole society of Christes bodie; which by the ancient Fathers, is ofte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But in the other sense, as the Fathers vsed it. It is taken in the eight Cannon of the Councel, called <hi>Gangren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,</hi> which was a very auncient and godly Councell, holden about the 324. yeare of Christ; wherein it was statute, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man presume to tak or dispone things offred to the Kirk, except the Bishoppe,<note place="margin">Carthag. council. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c, 95.

Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they may be called mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers both of the bodies and soules of men, as was declared in an other place.</p>
            <p>And I cannot see how we, who nowe beare office in the Kirke, can bee excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, vnles we proceed after this manner, as the auncient Kirke did against the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious of our time, who increase and multiplie daylie, In such sort, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out seuere discipline, they may not bee possibly suppressed.

            <p>Now, as to the Civil lawes, beginning at the lawes of the twelue Tables, which were moste aunciente amongst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes;</hi> we finde the same to be most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere against the Sacrilegious, bearing that they who did robbe by violence, or steale holy things, or things commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in custodie to holy places, should be holden as Parricides, that is, slayers of their Parentes.

I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce certaine ensamples of punishments of Sacrilegious persones, partely taken out of the Scriptures, and partly out of humane histories; of the which persons, diverse peradventure may be found lesse gyltie of this crime, then these with whome we haue to do, to the ende, that our sacrilegious (if they haue any feling) may feare the like judgements to fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; if not in this life, yet as great, or rather greater thereafter, when they shal haue no purse nor penny, power nor meanes to make restitution of that which they haue, with so euill conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quised. And first we haue two examples

which I haue diuerse times heretofore cited of ACHAN, in the Olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; of ANANIAS and SAPPHIRA, in the Newe: who were terribly punished for their Sacrilege; as it is at length set foorth in the Holie Histories, bearing their doings and Tragicall ende of their liues.</p>

            <p>I may for this purpose, produce ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other examples out of profane wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Of the which, for shortnesse of time I will onely collect and touche compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously some of the principals. There is a famous reporte, and past in a Prouerbe of the golde of <hi>Tholose,</hi> Which Q. SCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PIO and his souldiars spoyled from the temples of that Citie: howe they theraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter come to a miserable ouer-throwe. XERXES, king of Persia, invading <hi>Greece,</hi> with an innumerable army, was shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully driuen back, who sent, as the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie reporteth 400. souldiars to <hi>Delphus,</hi> to spoyle the Temple of <hi>Apollo;</hi> who were destroyed with thunder and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest. Q. FVLVIVS FLACCVS a Censour of <hi>Rome</hi> (as VALERIVS MAXIMVS wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) toke the pillers of the Temple of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> out of the Cittie of <hi>Locris,</hi> &amp; placed
<pb facs="tcp:27593:54"/>
them in his owne house; but he fel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in a phrensie, and so still continued: And finally, hearing tel of his three Sons, whereof one being dead, another was grieuously sick, he died miserably: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Senate being mooved, decreed to send these Pillars againe to their own place. Of this and such things, it appeares to haue past in a common Proverbe and saying amongst the Romanes, that they desired no more harme to their enemies, then to haue the stones of a Temple buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their house. <hi>Plemmenius</hi> likewise, a Romane Legate, hauing spoyled the Temple of <hi>Proserpina</hi> in <hi>Locris,</hi> as hee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed the spoyle in his ships, they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten and broken on the sea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ands, and the spoyle founde &amp; restored againe to the Temple. <hi>Plemmenius</hi> himselfe neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered thereafter. But being driuen from <hi>Italie</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> dyed a shamefull death. The like thing also we reade of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> And concerning <hi>Brennus,</hi> an aunciente king of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> how he with his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, going to spoyle the Temple of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos;</hi> the most parte of his armie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed with an earth-quake, himselfe so
<pb facs="tcp:27593:55"/>
smitten, that for sorrow he killed himself.</p>
            <p>But men may say, why produce I these e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nsamples of spoyling of Idols, &amp; Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous temples. Seeing, that by the juste judgement of God, they are, &amp; were all destroyed. I answer, that the cause wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true God of heauen, brought such punishments vpon them, who spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their own false gods; was, because of the Sacrilegious contempt, which these men did to them whome they helde for their gods; and so were enemies to their own relicques which they professed: &amp; that may serue to teach the Sacrilegious of our daies, how more seuerely they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue to be punished, either here or he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: who, professing the knowledg of the true God, vse such profane attempts, contrary to their Religion. For, as to such rake-hell houndes, as was <hi>Dionysius</hi> the tyranne of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> who can but abhor the Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, spewing out their abhominable taunts. Who after his Sacrilege commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in spoyling of his gods, hauing a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable winde in his navigation, saide to men, yee see friends, how favorable the gods be to the Sacrilegious. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="tcp:27593:55"/>
to the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Olympius,</hi> drew from him his golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cloak, skoffing, that it was too heauy to him for su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, &amp; too cold for winter, &amp; taking fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>AEscula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> his golden beard, saide, it seemed not the same to haue a beard, &amp; the father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> to be beardles. As also, when he took of al the gifts that wer offred to the idols, &amp; holden vp by their handes, pretended that they were willingly holden out and presented to him by the good gods. <hi>Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> also (of whom I spak before) as <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> reports, spoyling the temples of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> in skoffing maner said, that the gods who were rich, ought to bestow on mortall men, of their liberall gifts. But fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, this man in despaire killed himself: and the other, <hi>Dionysius,</hi> as is reported of him, vrged by an evill conscience, after that he had sold by publick voice &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, that which hee had spoyled from the Temples, compelled them to whom such things were sold, to restore them to the Temples, from the which they were taken. But how-so-euer this godles tyrant behaued himself: we read, how he was casten out of his kingdome,
<pb facs="tcp:27593:56"/>
&amp; being brought to great necessitie, was compelled to teach a Grammer Schoole at <hi>Corinthus.</hi> And shall wee think the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of such men, to be included on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within the short time of this life? albeit for the most parte, such men escaped not the Temporal punishments, as the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of their liues beares record.</p>
            <p>But let vs come to the nearer examples: when the <hi>Wandals</hi> came with a puissante armie, against Duke <hi>Gabinius</hi> (as is recited out of <hi>Eutropius</hi>) the Duke sente some of his Captaines disguised, to see whither the <hi>Wandals</hi> reverenced the Temples of the Christians, or spoyled them. If they spoyle or violate them (saith he) the God whom the Christians worship, whom I know not, if he be so powerfull, as they saye, will not spare them that spoyle his houses; and so it come to passe: For the <hi>Wandals</hi> marching forwarde, inriched with the spoyle and goodes of the Kirke; were vanquished in battell, slaine, &amp; put to diverse torments. But <hi>Alaricus,</hi> king of the <hi>Gotthes,</hi> by the contrary, hauing won <hi>Rome,</hi> would not suffer his men to spoile the Temple of S. PETER, nor touch any
<pb facs="tcp:27593:56"/>
person being therein, for the reverence he did bere to the place. <hi>Clotharius</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> likewise (as <hi>Turonenss</hi> writeth) presuming most irrelegiously (as certaine other Kinges) to take the goodes of the kirk into his Thesaurie, made an Edicte, that all the Kirkes of his Realme, should pay to him the third parte of their fruits. But being rebuked of a certaine Bishop, did retreat his ordinance: a rare example indeed; For there is a pestiferous mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, whereof few amend by repentance. To come yet nearer, wee reade of King WILLIAM of <hi>England,</hi> called <hi>Rufus,</hi> who for his pleasure &amp; pastime, to inlarge his Forrest, demolished 17. Parish Kirks, and all the Townes about them. But in the same forrest, being at his game, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place (as some say) where one of the Kirks stood, was slaine by an arrow, shot at a Deere, by a certaine Knight, &amp; there fell down dead immediatly. For pleasure procured with the displeasure of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, cannot well profite. As for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall examples of Kinges of this Cuntrie, that were spoylers of the Kirk, or Kirk-goods, they are very rare to bee
<pb facs="tcp:27593:57"/>
found. Indeede wee reade of <hi>Feredethus,</hi> who arrogate vnto himself the kingdom of <hi>Pictes,</hi> after the death of <hi>Hungus,</hi> that he toke againe from the Kirk &amp; ministers thereof, such as then were the possessions which <hi>Hungus</hi> (being a godly king) had giuen them: Which is reported to haue bin one of the causes, wherfore the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Pictes,</hi> thereafter was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
            <p>But amongst the Scottes Kinges, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer read of any that tooke from the kirk any possessions. So did they abhor Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, howsoeuer otherwaies some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were wicked, and of licencious life: But it is easie to reade, of very many that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed liberally vppon the seruice of God: And more liberally in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes then become them; yet alwaies godly as they supposed in their zeale. And albeit, I allowe no superfluitie in the Kirke-rentes, but all may serue the king, in time of necessitie: Yet this may bee esteemed as one of the causes that GOD hes continued his Kingdome to stand so long vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quished or translated to Forrayne power, aboue the continual
<pb facs="tcp:27593:57"/>
successe of an hundreth generationes. Which is rare to be founde in any other kingdome: The Lorde graunt that the corruption of our dayes, bring not such an alteration as wee haue not seene, nor yet haue heard of before. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather prayse others, who by their godly zeale, haue advanced the service of God, and bestowed liberally of their substance, for maintenance of the same. In the booke of Exodus, wee haue a<note place="margin">Exod. 36.</note> notable example of the people of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, <hi>Who offered so liberally, to the wooke of the Tabernacle, that</hi> MOYSES <hi>vvas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to cause proclayme throughout the hoste, that no man or vvoman should offer any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the service and building thereof. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there were yuough, and more bestowed already to that effect.</hi> Oh what contrarietie is betweene them and their doings, and our men, who cannot cease nor leaue off without any hoe, to takaway that which hath bin offred by others, til almost now there is no thing left behind. <hi>The like zeal</hi>

               <hi>not be he, but his Sonne that should buyld an house vnto the Lord: He ceased not to prepare all thinges necessarie for that worke, in his dayes. And to exhort grauely, his Son</hi> SOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON <hi>to accomplish the same. Declaring how he, according to his habilitie, had separated for the performing of that buylding, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth thousand talents of Gold, &amp; 1000000. of siluer, brasse &amp; iron, without weight, besides wood &amp; stone. To the which great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (not thinking it yuough, he desired</hi> SOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON
<pb facs="tcp:27593:58"/>
               <hi>&amp; his Nobles, to adde more, as they did in very deed liberally and magnificently:</hi> As the holy History beareth record. <hi>Besides, this K.</hi> DAVID <hi>left of his own money (besides</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Chro. 29</note> 
               <hi>that which he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quished of his enemies) to the ornament of the walles of the Temple, and other such vses, three thousand talents of gold of</hi> Ophir, <hi>and seuen thousand talents of fined siluer: Exhorting the Princes of Israell, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their faculties, to follow his ensample: Who being instigate by him</hi> (far vnlike our degenerate Nobilitie) <hi>gaue freely to the worke of the Lorde, 5000. talents of golde, and 10000. talents of siluer: Of brasse 18000, and of Iron, 100000 talents, which will amounte to exceeding summes of our money. And it may be iudged, that King</hi> SALOMON <hi>doubled more.</hi> Now, if so much was bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a materiall Temple building, what su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes thinke yee, were employed yeerly for interteineme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Priests &amp; Levits, who had not onely the teindes of the whole Lande, but also the great offrings, and first fruits of the increase.</p>
            <p>But if any wil alleage, that this Cuntry which we inhabit, is poore, in respecte of the Lande of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that flowed with
<pb facs="tcp:27593:59"/>
milke and hony: and therefore may not spare so large provision vpon the Kirkes affaires. I would answere and demaund, who makes it poore, so much as you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable pullers away of the rent already giuen to the Kirk, to your particular vses, provoking thereby the Lorde to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his blessing from the Land which otherwise were able to yeeld sufficient provision, both for the Kirk, King, and common wealth. Doth not God say by his Prophet: <hi>Bring all the teinds in my The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saurie, that there may be meate in my house, and proue me now in this, sayth the Lorde of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Hostes, if I shall not make open the Windowes of Heauen, and poure downe a blessing vnto you</hi> And SOLOMON sayeth, <hi>Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firste fruites of all thy increase: so shall thy Barnes be filled with abundance, and thy presses prest with new wine.</hi> Is it not a miserable thing, and vnworthie to bee heard tell of, in anie forrayne Countrie, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites of Israell, who were in number 38000. aboue twentie yeares of age, with their wiues and children, and the whole poore of the Lande were so liberallie
<pb facs="tcp:27593:59"/>
provided for and interteined sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And nowe amongst vs, albeit it were but 600. Ministers to serue the whole Countrie of <hi>Scotland,</hi> sufficiente liues cannot be provided for them? yea, of them that are planted, a greate num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were left little better then begging, and some notable men left altogether destitute? O miserable age, and vnhappy dayes that we be fallen into? Shall not the Papistes in their blinde zeale, ryse vp in judgemente against this vnthankful generation, who susteined thousands in their Kirkes, Abbaies, and Cloisters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that which they delt to the poore, vppon the Kirke-rentes: And nowe there be not so much lefte, as to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine a fewe Ministers, Colleges, and Schooles, albeit the poore should be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly neglected.</p>
            <p>May it not greatly ashame Christian Princes and others, that spoyle and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Kirk of God to be spoyled. When as <hi>Cyrus, Darius,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> heathen Princes, did bestow liberally, to buylde vp the temple again in Ierusalem, which NEBVCHADNETZAR had destroyed,
<pb facs="tcp:27593:60"/>
as the books of <hi>Esra</hi> and <hi>Nehemias</hi> beare record. And the same <hi>Cyrus</hi> reverencing the God of heauen, of whom he had but little knowledge, did sende againe the vessels of golde and silver which NEBV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHADNETZAR had taken, to be restored to the temple of God, vnder the hand of <hi>Zerubbabel.</hi> Whereto should I insist to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite other examples, as of <hi>Asa, Iehoshaphat Ioas, Ezechias,</hi> and <hi>Iosias</hi> Kinges of <hi>Iuda,</hi> whose dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was very careful in repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raling the house of the Lorde, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the Priests &amp; Levits, in such sort that great heapes were left, after that all were fully satisfyed: wheranent, because shortnes of time, cuteth of amplificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I remit you to the histories of the books of the kings &amp; chronicls: wherein also, may be found, how because these Kings were zealous mainteiners of the true religion, &amp; holy ministerie, God prospered them inal their affairs, so long as they perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereinto. I might also recite a greate Catalogue of christian Princes, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of such ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t kings doted the Kirk with sufficient patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. As the zeale of <hi>Constantine,</hi> &amp; others
<pb facs="tcp:27593:60"/>
godly Emperours and Kings; yea, euen of the Kings of our owne Nation, who haue bene (as our Chronicles and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient monuments beare record) very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall in this behalfe: But I may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse euery particular.</p>
            <p>Onely this I conclude, seeing that without Religion and justice, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth can stande (for these are the two pillers, whereby the estate of all well governed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealths is vp-holden) it is greatly to be feared, least this our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth shal come to great desolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; decay, vnles speedy remedie be found out to stay the inconvenientes and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that be at hande. For as to Iustice, where is it? when wrong partiall dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in judgement and oppression<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, not onely Sacrilege, but Sorcerie, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, adulterie, falshood, and all other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable enormities, reigne at such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie without punishment. And as to Religion, how can it but decay? vnlesse God speedely put to his extraordinarie hande, when all ordinary meanes are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, whereby it should be intertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and Idolatrie and Atheisme already
<pb facs="tcp:27593:61"/>
entred in place thereof, in many parts of this Land, and like to enter further day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For albeit, many Kirks of the Realme, lack the Ministrie of the worde; there is no meanes left to provide them, for all the Kirk rent is exhausted vpon greedie gormandes, carelesse of Religion, and that would with IVDAS sell Christ, or with the godlesse souldiars of PILATE, crucifie him for his garments; who haue never left off gaping, and shamelesly vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ouer-liberal a Prince, till they haue gotten all in their handes. Example wee see this day, when as the poore Ministers come to that woeful platte, or send their Commissioners, thinking to haue the Kirkes planted with sufficient Ministers and stipendes, they are sent home emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when they haue wayted long on without all comfort. For there is nothing to augment, or advance any man, to any vacant roome, vnlesse one Minister take from another; and so be exponed to the mockage of these, who haue spoyled the rentes wehereupon they should be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steined, when they see them contending one against another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27593:61"/>And can the King (thinke ye) bee in a good case, when the estate of the Kirke, which was the first in Parliament, is so wracked? No, for if he euer haue warre, or other great enterprises ado, as it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is shortly to haue: he shall lack that (to speake worldly) which was his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall reliefe and ayde: to wit, the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saurie of the kirk, to advance such weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie affaires. For as to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon whom the same is vnworthely bestowed (I meane the Kirk-lands and rents) they shall fayle him in his greatest neede. For it is not his weale nor standing that they haue sought, but their owne particular, with insatiable greede. And now when they haue done, the Lord shall so blowe vpon it, that they or their aires shalbe no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it: but rather (because it is procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Gods curse) it shall wrack the rest of their patrimonie and aunciente houses, as experience hath prouen in some of them. And as to the Kings Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, seeing that his estate, euen from his Coronation, hes bene so annexed and joyned with the estate of the Kirke, and reformed Religion, that it hath wel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb facs="tcp:27593:62"/>
hitherto by experience, that the standing of the one, hath made the other also to stande: it is justly to be feared (the Lord auerte it) that the ruine and decay of Religion in this Realme (if God of his just judgement suffer it) may bring ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great daunger to his person, and royal authoritie; yea, to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. And the authors of these new erectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the kirk lands inheritable titles to them selues, and priuate vses, shal be a chiefe cause thereof: and that by with-drawing the blessing of God from the Lande, and procuring his wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the same. The Lord remeid these appearing euilles by time.</p>
            <p>Now, returning to our Text, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with the Apostle, in the verses following, as he most justly rebukes the Iewes, who gloryed in the law of God, and yet by breaking of the Law (by their Sacrilege, and other odious crimes) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored his holy Majestie; declaring thereby the light regard they had to that Religion, which they outwardly profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, so it may be justly layd to the charge of this vnthankfull generation, that our
<pb facs="tcp:27593:62"/>
outward glorie in his religion, shal turne to the vtter confusion of many in this Lande. For if it be (as it is most true) that they who honour GOD, hee shall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure them; and they who contemne his worshippe, shall bee brought to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie and shame. Howe can our fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned profession worke otherwaies, when the Doctrine of Christ his Evangell, whereof men wil so babble in their idle talking, is so profaned and abused in their daily life and conversation: So that the name of that good God, who hath so meruelously and mercifully in-lightned this nation aboue others, with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his vndoubted trueth, by our licentious liuing, being trod vnderfoot, his name is euill spoken of by our occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongst the Papistes, and other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the trueth, as it was amongst the Gentiles, by occasion of the euil liues of the Iewes in their captiuitie; as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet EZECHIEL here cited by our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth testifie of them. And is it not<note place="margin">Ezech. 36</note> a most vnworthie thinge, that they who haue receiued glorie and honour from God, as our vnthankfull Nation haue, in
<pb facs="tcp:27593:63"/>
granting vs so great light, denyed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mightie Kingdomes of the earth, to render againe such gracelesse payment, as so to dishonour his holy name. The Lord graunt, that at least, so many as are appoynted for his heauenly kingdome, may speedily repent with ZACCHEVS; &amp; the reste, at least, be not inferiour to IV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAS, who restored that which hee had most sacrilegiously taken, in betraying his Maister the Lord Iesus our Saviour. To whome with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and prayse for euer.</p>
