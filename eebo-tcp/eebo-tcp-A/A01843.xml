            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And <hi>Browne</hi> also, a good while afore, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

Neuerthelesse God was so good vnto him, and schooled him so well in that short time of imprisonment, as he cloased vp his life with a maruellous apparance of heartie repentance, constant trust in Gods mercy through Iesus Christ, and willingnesse to forsake this miserable worlde.</p>
            <p>Nowe remayneth to shewe what is to be gathered of this terrible example, and how we oughte to apply the same to our owne behoofe. First I note with S. Paule, that when men regarde not to knowe God, or not to honour him when they know him: God giueth them ouer to their own lustes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o as they runne on from sinne to sinne, and from mischiefe to mischiefe, to do suche things as are shamefull and odious, euen in the sight of the worlde, to their owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auoidable
<pb facs="tcp:20415:12"/>
perils. And when the measure of their iniquitie is filled vp, there is no way for them to escape the iustice of God, which they haue prouoked. Insomuche, that if they might eschue all bodily punishment: yet the very hell of their owne conscience would prosecute them, and the sting of their minde would be a continuall prison, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and torture to them, wheresoeuer they went. Agayne on the other side, we must marke the infinit greatnesse of Gods wisdome and mercy, who perceyuing the peruerse wilfulnesse of mans frowarde na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to sinning, suffreth men sometimes to runne so long vpon the bridle, till it séeme to themselues, that they may safely do what they liste, and to the worlde, that they be past recouerie vnto goodnesse: and yet in the end catching them in their chiefe pride, he rayseth them by their ouerthrow, amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them by their wickednesse, and reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them by their death, in such wise blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the stayne of their former filthe, that their darknesse is turned into light, and their terrour to their comfort. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, when God bringeth such matters vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the stage, vnto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> open face of the world: It is not to the intent that men should gaze and wonder at the persons, as byrdes do at
<pb facs="tcp:20415:12"/>

Beholde, wee bée all made of the same moulde, printed with the same stampe, and indued with the same nature that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are.

            <p>Suche as the roote is, suche are the braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the twiggs of a thorne or bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble can beare no grapes. That we stande, it is the benefite of Gods grace, and not the goodnesse of our nature, nor the strengthe of oure owne will. That they are falne, it was of frayltie: wherfrom we be no more priuiledged than they: and that shoulde we ouersoone perceiue by experience, if we wer left to our selues. He that looketh s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>When it was tolde oure Sauiour Chryst that Pylate had mingled the bloud of certain men with their owne sacrifise, what aunswere made hée?

He hath shewed in some, what al of vs deserue, to prouoke vs al to repentance, that al of vs myght haue mercie at his hand, and shewe mercie one to an other, &amp; with one mouthe and one hearte glorifie his goodnesse. It is sayde by the Prophete Samuel, that diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is as the sinne of Witchcrafte. Lette euery of vs looke into himselfe (but first lette him put on the spectacles of Gods lawe, and carie the lyghte of Gods worde with him) and he shall sée suche a gulfe of disobedience in himselfe, as he maye well thinke there is none offender but himselfe. I say not this as a cloaker of offences, that white should not be called white, &amp; blacke:

            <p>Finally, let al folkes both maried and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried, learne hereby to possesse and kéepe their vessell in honestie and cleannesse. For if the knot betwene man and wife (whiche ought to be inseparable) be once broken, it is seldome or neuer knit again. And though it be, yet is not the wound so throughly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but there appéereth some skarre euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But if the sore rancle &amp; fester inwardly (as commonly it doth except the more grace of God be) in the end it bursteth forth to the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or hurt of both parties, not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without great harme to others also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides themselues, as we sée by this example. For when the body which was dedicated to God to be his temple and the tab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>rnacle of his holy spirite, is become the sinke of sinne and cage of vncleannesse the deuill ceasseth not to driue the parties still headlong vnto naughtinesse, till they be falne eyther into

Therefore good reader, so heare and reade this present example, as the same may turne to the bettering of thy state, and not to occasion of slaunder, nor to the hurt of thine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, nor to the offence of thy Christian brethren.</p>

            <p>GOod people, I am come hither to die the deathe, wherevnto I am adiudged, as worthely &amp; as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruedly as euer died any: I had a good husband, by whom I had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie children, with whom I liued in wealth, &amp; might haue done stil, had not the deuill kindled in my hearte, first the hellish firebrand of vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lust, &amp; afterward a murtherous intent to procure my saide husbande to be bereued of his life, which was also by my wicked meanes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, as to the world is known. And as I woulde if he coulde heare me, if it might be, prostrate vpon the ground, at my husbands feete, aske mercy with plentiful teares of him, so that which I may &amp; I oughte to doe, I aske mercye of God, I aske mercie of all men and women of the world, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by my deede &amp; example I haue offended: and especiallye I

And I thank God with my whole harte, he hathe not suffered me to haue the reigne and bridle of sinning gyuen me at my will, to the daunger of my eternall damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that he hath founde out my sin, &amp; brought me to punishment in this world, by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to amend, to spare, and saue me in the world to come: &amp; I beseche him graunte me his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly grace, that all who do behold or shall heare of my death, maye by the example therof be frayed from like sinning.
