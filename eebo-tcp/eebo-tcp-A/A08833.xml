         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THou haſt here deliuered to thee, good Reader, a little Treatiſe, firſt written in the Italian tongue, and printed at Venice, after that, tranſlated into the French language, and printed at Lyons, and now tranſlated and printed for thee to reade in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh tongue. Enquire not of the Author, hee is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, and to know him would doe thee but little good. Reade the booke deuoutly, regard the matter of it attentiuely, it may doe thee much good in theſe euill dayes. This may be counted among the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt euils with which this age is infected, that they which are called Chriſtians, are miſerably diuided about Chriſt. And yet in truth (as the Apoſtle ſaith vnto vs,) there is but one God, which is the Father, of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 6</note> whom are all things, and we in him: and one Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him. To diſcourſe on this diuiſion and the cauſe thereof, would be to ſome pleaſing, to ſome it would be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. For what one truth can pleaſe minds ſo diuerſly diuided? would God it could pleaſe all to become one in that one Chriſt, whoſe name we all doe carry. In this little booke is that benefit, which commeth by Chriſt crucified, to the Chriſtians, truly and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably handled: which benefit if all Chriſtians did true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtand and faithfully embrace, this diuiſion would vaniſh away, and in Chriſt the Chriſtians ſhould become one. To this end reade this booke, and much good in Chriſt may it doe to all them which doe reade it.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He holy Scripture ſaith, that God <note place="margin">The ſtate of man before &amp; after that he had ſinned.</note> created man after his owne I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and likeneſſe, making him, as in reſpect of his body, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible; and as touching his Soule, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, true, good, mercifull, and holy. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, he being ouercome with deſire of knowledge, had eaten of the Apple that God had forbidden him, he loſt the ſaid Image and likeneſſe of God, and became like the bruite beaſts, and like the diuell who had abuſed him. For as touching his Soule, he became vnrighteous, vntrue, cruell, pittileſſe, and the enemy of God: and as touching his body, he became paſſible, and ſubiect to a thouſand inconueniences and diſeaſes: and not onely like, but alſo inferiour to brute beaſts. And euen as if our forefathers had obeyed God, they ſhould haue left vs their righteouſneſſe and holineſſe as an heritage: euen ſo by being
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7709:4"/>
diſobedient vnto God, they haue left vs the Inheritance of vnrighteouſneſſe, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Gods diſpleaſure, in ſuch ſort as it is vnpoſſible for vs (through our owne ſtrength) to loue God, or to frame our ſelues vnto his holy will. Nay we be enemies vnto him, as to one that muſt puniſh our ſinnes, becauſe he is a iuſt Iudge, and therefore can we not any more truſt wholly to his holy mercy. To be ſhort, our whole nature was corrupted by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne. And like as erſt it had ſuperiority aboue all creatures, ſo became it an vnderling to all, the bondſlaue of Satan, ſinne, and death, and condemned to the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of hell. Alſo he loſt his iudgement alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and began to ſay that good was euill, and euill good: eſteeming falſe things to be true, and true things to be falſe. Which thing the Prophet conſidering, ſaith: <hi>that all men are lyers, and that there is not one that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 114.</note> 
               <hi>doth good,</hi> becauſe the diuell like a ſtout man <note place="margin">Pſal. 14.</note> of Armes, ruleth his owne palace, that is to wit, the world, whereof he became the prince and lord. There is no tongue that can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the thouſandth part of our miſery, in that we being created by Gods owne hand, haue loſt the ſaid Image of God, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like the diuell, and too like to him in nature and condition, willing whatſoeuer
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7709:4"/>
he willeth, and likewiſe refuſing whatſoeuer he miſliketh. By reaſon whereof being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vp for a prey to that wicked ſpirit, there is no ſinne ſo grieuous, which euery one of vs would not be ready to doe, if the Grace of God ſtay vs not. And this our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation of righteouſneſſe, and this forward <note place="margin">Originall ſinne.</note> inclination to all vnrighteouſneſſe and nangh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, is called originall ſinne: the which we bring with vs from out of our mothers wombe, ſo as we be borne the children of wrath: and it hath had his firſt ſpring from our firſt fathers, and is the cauſe and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all the ſinnes and iniquities that we commit; wherefrom if we will be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and returne againe to our firſt innocency, to recouer the Image of God: firſt of all it ſtandeth vs on hand to know our owne wretchedneſſe. For like as no man will euer <note place="margin">A very good compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> ſeeke to the Phyſicion, except he know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be diſeaſed, or acknowledge the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Phyſicion, and how much he is bound vnto him, except he know his owne diſeaſe to be peſtilent and deadly: euen ſo no man acknowledgeth Ieſus Chriſt the onely Phyſicion of our ſoules, except he firſt know his owne ſoule to be diſeaſed: neither can he perceiue the excellency of him, nor how much he is bound vnto him, except he firſt

            <p>VVHen as our God then had ſent the ſaid great Prophet which he had promiſed vs (who is his only Sonne,) to the end that he ſhould ſet vs free from the curſe <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3.</note> of the Law, and reconcile vs vnto our God: that he ſhould make our will fit for good workes, healing our free-will, and repairing in vs the foreſaid Image of God which we had loſt through the fault of our firſt parents: <note place="margin">Acts 4.</note> foraſmuch as we know that vnder heauen there is none other name giuen vnto men whereby we may be ſaued, but the name of Ieſus Chriſt: Let vs runne vnto him with the feet of liuely faith, and caſt our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his armes, ſith he allureth vs ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, crying: <hi>Come vnto me, all you that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and are heauy laden, and I will refreſh</hi>

               <hi>you:</hi> What comfort or what ioy in this life can be comparable to this his ſaying there, when as a man feeling himſelfe oppreſſed with the intolerable waight of his ſinnes, vnderſtandeth ſo ſweet and amiable words of the Sonne of God, who promiſeth ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7709:7"/>
graciouſly to refreſh and rid him of his great paines? But all the matter lyeth in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our owne weakeneſſe and miſery in good earneſt. For he ſhall neuer know what is ſweet, who hath not taſted of the ſowre. And therefore Ieſus Chriſt ſaith: <hi>If any man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iohn 7.</note> 
               <hi>thirſt, let him come to me and drinke:</hi> as if he had meant to ſay, If a man know not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a ſinner, nor thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he cannot taſte of the ſweetneſſe of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, how ſweet it is to talke of him, to thinke of him, and to follow his moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life. But when we once throughly know our owne infirmitie by meanes of the Law: let vs hearken to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, who pointeth vs to the Soueraigne Phyſician with his finger, ſaying: <hi>Behold the Lambe of God,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iohn 8.</note> 
               <hi>which taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</hi> For hee it is that deliuereth vs from the heauy <note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> yoke of the Law, abrogating and diſanulling the curſes &amp; ſharpe threatnings of the ſame: healing all our infirmities: reforming our free-will, returning vs to our ancient inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and repayring in vs the Image of our God: inſomuch that (according to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſaying) like as by <hi>Adam</hi> wee bee all <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> dead: ſo by Ieſus Chriſt wee are all quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And it is not to be beleeued that the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which wee haue by inheritance
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7709:8"/>
from him, ſhould be of more force then the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, that which alſo we inherit by faith. It ſeemeth that man hath great cauſe to complaine, that (without any reaſon why,) he is conceiued and borne in <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> ſinne, and in the wickedneſſe of his parents, by meanes of whom, death reigneth ouer all men. But now is all our ſorrow taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, inaſmuch as by a like meane (without any occaſion giuen on our behalfe) righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and euerlaſting life are come by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and by him death is ſlaine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> maketh a very godly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which I purpoſe to ſet downe here following. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>like as by one</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> 
               <hi>man ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne: euen ſo death went ouer all men, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as all men haue ſinned.</hi> For vntill the Law, ſinne was in the world: but ſinne was not regarded as long as there was no Law. Neuertheleſſe death reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Moſes,</hi> euen ouer them alſo that ſinned not after the like manner of the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was a figure of him that was to come. But yet the gift is not ſo as is the offence: for if through the offence of one, many be dead: much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace which is by one man Ieſus Chriſt, hath abounded vnto many.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7709:8"/>
Neither is the gift ſo as that which entred in by one that ſinned. For the fault came of one offence vnto condemnation, but the gift is of many offences to iuſtification. For if by the offence of one, death reigned through one: much more ſhall they which receiue the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of grace and of the gift of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, reigne in life through one, that is, Ieſus Chriſt. Likewiſe then, as by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one, that fault came on all men to condemnation, ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one, the benefit abounded toward all men to the iuſtification of life. For as by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be alſo made righteous. Moreouer the Law entred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that the offence ſhould abound: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe where ſinne abounded, there grace abounded much more, that as ſinne had reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto death, ſo might grace alſo reigne by righteouſneſſe vnto eternall life, through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord. By theſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> we manifeſtly perceiue the thing to be true, which we haue ſaid heretofore: that is to wit, that the Law was giuen to make ſinne knowne: which ſin we doe alſo know, not to be of greater force then Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, where-through we be iuſtified before God. For euen as Ieſus Chriſt is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7709:9"/>
ſtronger then <hi>Adam</hi> was: ſo is his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe more mightie then the ſinne of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> And if the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient inough to make all men ſinners and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath without any miſdeed of our owne: much more ſhall Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be of greater force to make vs all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the children of grace, without any of our owne good works: which cannot be good, vnleſſe that before we doe them, wee our ſelues be made good, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo affirmeth. Hereby a man may know in what <note place="margin">The greatnes of ſinne ought not to cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire.</note> errour they be, who by reaſon of ſome great offence, deſpaire of Gods good will, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he is not willing to forgiue, couer, and pardon all ſinne, hauing already puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and chaſtiſed all our ſinnes and iniquities in his owne onely begotten and dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Sonne, and conſequently granted a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pardon to all mankinde, which euery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enioyeth that beleeueth the Goſpell, that is to ſay, which beleeueth the happy tydings that the Apoſtles haue publiſhed through the whole world, ſaying: We beſeech you for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, <hi>Be ye reconciled vnto God:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> for he that neuer knew ſinne, was made a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for our ſinne, that we might become righteous in him. The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing this great goodneſſe of God, writeth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7709:9"/>
theſe heauenly words, which doe ſo well paint out the paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the cauſe thereof, as it is not to be found better deſcribed, euen in the writings of the Apoſtles. Who (ſaith he) will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue our report, and to whom is the arme of the Lord reuealed? But he ſhall grow vp before him as a branch and as a root out of a dry ground, he hath neither forme nor beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: when we ſhall ſee him, there ſhall be no forme that wee ſhould deſire him: Hee is deſpiſed and reiected of men, he is a man full of ſorrowes, and hath experience of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we hid as it were our faces from him: he was deſpiſed, and wee eſteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our infirmities and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried our ſorrowes, yet we did iudge him as plagued and ſmitten of God, and humbled: but he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions: he was broken for our iniquities. The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement of our peace was vpon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed. All wee like ſheepe haue gone aſtray: we haue turned eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to his owne way, and the Lord hath laid vpon him the iniquity of vs all: he was oppreſſed, and hee was afflicted, yet did hee not open his mouth. He is brought as a ſheep to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheepe before the ſhearer is dumme, ſo hee openeth not his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7709:10"/>
mouth. O great vnkindneſſe! O thing abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable! that wee which profeſſe our ſelues Chriſtians, and heare that the Sonne of God hath taken all our ſins vpon him, and waſhed them out with his precious blood, ſuffering himſelfe to be faſtened to the Croſſe for our ſakes: ſhould neuertheleſſe make as though we would iuſtifie our ſelues, and purchaſe forgiueneſſe of our ſins by our owne works: as who would ſay, that the deſerts, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and bloodſhed of Ieſus Chriſt were not enough to doe it, vnleſſe we came to put to our workes and righteouſneſſe which are altogether defiled and ſpotted with ſelf-loue, ſelfe-liking, ſelfe-profit, and a thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanities, for which we haue neede to craue pardon at Gods hand, rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward! Neither doe we thinke of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> vſeth to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who hauing beene deceiued by falſe Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, beleeued not that the Iuſtification by Faith was ſufficient of it ſelfe, but went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſtill to be made righteous by the Law. Vnto whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Ieſus Chriſt <note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> ſhall nothing profit you that iuſtifie your ſelues by the Law: for you be falne from Grace, becauſe that wee through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of faith, waite for the hope of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Now if the ſeeking of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7709:10"/>
and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, by the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <note place="margin">An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of our owne workes.</note> of the Law which God gaue vpon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with ſo great glory and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, be the denying of Chriſt and of his Grace: what ſhall wee ſay to thoſe that will needes iuſtifie themſelues afore God, by their owne lawes and obſeruances? I would wiſh that ſuch folkes ſhould a little compare the one with the other, and afterward giue Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelues. God mindeth not to doe that honour, not to giue that glory to his owne Law, and yet they will haue him to giue it to mens lawes and ordinances. But that honour is giuen onely to his onely begotten Sonne, who alone by the ſacrifice of <note place="margin">Hebr. 7. Iohn 12.</note> his death and paſſion, hath made full amends for all our ſinnes paſt, preſent, and to come, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> declare. Wherefore as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as wee apply this ſatisfaction of Ieſus Chriſt, vnto our ſoules by faith: out of all doubt we obtaine forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and become good and righteous before God, through his righteouſneſſe. And therefore after that S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid, that as touching the righteouſneſſe of the law, he had liued <note place="margin">Philip. 3.</note> vnblameable: he addeth, And yet whatſoeuer I haue gained by it, I haue accounted it in all reſpects to bee but loſſe, for the loue of Chriſt. And ſpecially I eſteeme all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7709:11"/>
things to be loſſe, for the excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Ieſus Chriſt my Lord, for whom I haue counted all things to be loſſe, and deeme them but as dung, ſo I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not hauing mine owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which is of the law, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes which is by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, which righteouſneſſe is giuen of God, I meane the righteouſneſſe of faith, that I may come to the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt. O moſt notable words, which all Chriſtians ought to haue ingrauen in their hearts, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to make them to taſte it perfectly. Loe, how S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth plainely, that whoſoeuer knoweth Chriſt aright, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all the works of the law to be hurtfull, forſomuch as they make vs to ſwarue from our truſt in Ieſus Chriſt, to whom euery man ought to impute his ſaluation, and to truſt only vnto him alone. And to inforce this ſentence the more, he addeth further, that he eſteemeth all things but as dung, ſo hee may gaine Chriſt, and be found incorporated in him: declaring thereby, that whoſoeuer tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in his owne works, and pretendeth to iuſtifie himſelfe by them, getteth not Ieſus Chriſt, neither is ingrafted into him. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the whole myſtery of our faith conſiſteth in the truth hereof: to the end we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7709:11"/>
might the better vnderſtand what he meant to ſay: he addeth and repeateth oftentimes, that he had nothing to doe with all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward iuſtification and all the righteouſneſſe that is grounded vpon the keeping of the law, but that he would clothe himſelfe with the righteouſneſſe which God giueth by faith, to all them that beleeue that all our ſins are fully chaſtiſed and puniſhed in Ieſus Chriſt: and that Ieſus Chriſt (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <note place="margin">1 Cor. 18.</note> is made our wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and redemption, to the end (as it is written) that he which will glory, ſhould glory in the Lord, and not in his own works. Very true it is, that in the holy Scriptures there are ſome texts to be found, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſunderſtood, ſeeme to gaineſay this holy doctrine of S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and to attribute iuſtification and remiſſion of ſinnes vnto workes, and to charity. But thoſe authorities haue already beene well expounded by ſome, who haue ſhewed plainely, that ſuch as haue vnderſtood them in the ſenſe aforeſaid, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood them not aright. Wherefore my deare-beloued brethren, let vs not follow the fond opinion of the bewitched <hi>Galatians,</hi> but rather let vs follow the truth which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs, and let vs giue the whole glory of our iuſtification vnto Gods mercy,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7709:12"/>
and to the merits of his Sonne, who by his owne bloodſhed hath ſet vs free from the Soueraignty of the Law, and from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſinne and death: and hath brought vs into the Kingdom of God, to giue vs life and endleſſe felicity. I ſay yet further, that he hath deliuered vs from the dominion of the law, inſomuch as he hath giuen vs his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who teacheth vs all truth, and that he hath ſatisfied the Law to the full, and giuen the ſame ſatisfaction vnto all his members, (that is to wit, to all true Chriſtians) ſo as they may ſafely appeare at Gods Throne, becauſe they be cloathed with the righteouſneſſe of his <note place="margin">How man is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſet free from the curſe of the Law.

Then can not the law any more accuſe vs or condemne vs, nor mooue our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections or appetites, nor increaſe ſinne in vs. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was againſt vs, is cancelled by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and diſcharged vpon the tree of the Croſſe, inſomuch as he hath ſet vs free from the ſubiection of the Law, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from the tyranny of ſinne and death, which can no more hold vs oppreſſed, becauſe it is ouercome by Ieſus Chriſt in his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and ſo conſequently by vs which are his members, in ſuch manner, that wee may ſay with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

               <hi>Oſee,</hi> Death is quite vanquiſhed and deſtroyed. <hi>O death, where is thy ſting! O Hell where is thy victory! The ſting of Death is</hi>

Hee is <note place="margin">Gen. 8.</note> the bleſſed Seede that hath cruſhed the head of the venemous Serpent, that is to wit, of the diuell, inſomuch that all thoſe which beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, repoſing their whole truſt in his grace, doe ouercome ſinne, death, the Diuell and hell, as Chriſt hath done. He is that bleſſed Seede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the which God hath promiſed bleſſedneſſe to all Nations. It behooued euery particular perſon to fight with the ſaid horrible Serpent, and to deliuer himſelfe from that curſe. But that enterprize was ſo great, that all the force of the whole World knit together, was not able to goe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with it. Wherefore our God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercy, being mooued with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of our miſeries, hath giuen vs his onely begotten Sonne, who hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs from the venime of the Serpent, and is himſelfe become our Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Righteouſneſſe, conditionally that we accept the ſame, renouncing all our owne outward iuſtifications.

Then my deare brethren, let vs imbrace the righteouſneſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and let vs make it ours by meanes of faith: let vs aſſure our ſelues that we bee righteous, not for our owne workes, but through the merits of Ieſus Chriſt, and let vs liue merrily and aſſured, that the righteouſneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt hath vtterly done away all our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, and made vs good, righteous, and holy before God, who beholding vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into his Sonne by faith, eſteemeth vs not now any more as the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> but as his owne children, and hath made vs heires of all his riches, with his owne begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne.</p>

            <p>THis holy faith worketh after ſuch a <note place="margin">How wee receiue the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God.</note> ſort in vs, that he which beleeueth that Ieſus Chriſt hath taken all his ſinnes vpon him, becommeth like vnto Chriſt, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth ſinne, the diuell, death and hell. And the reaſon thereof is this: namely, that the Church (that is to wit euery faithfull ſoule) is Chriſts wife, and Chriſt is her husband.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7709:13"/>
For we know how the law of marriage is, that of two, they become one ſelfe-ſame <note place="margin">A very good ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the manner how our ſins are taken away by Chriſt.</note> thing, being two in one fleſh, and that the goods &amp; ſubſtance of either of them become common to them both: by means wherof the husband ſaith, that the dowry of the wife is his, and likewiſe the wife ſaith that her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands houſe and all his riches are hers: and of a truth ſo they are: for otherwiſe they ſhould not be one fleſh, as the Scripture ſaith. After the ſame manner hath God married his onely begotten and deare-beloued Son to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoule, which hath not any other thing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar of her owne, ſaue onely ſinne, and yet the Sonne of God hath not diſdained to take her for his wel-beloued Spouſe, together with her peculiar dowry, which is ſinne. And now by reaſon of the vnion which is in this holy marriage, looke what the one hath, is alſo the others. Ieſus Chriſt therefore ſaith thus: The dowry of mans ſoule my deare wife, (that is to wit her ſinnes and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Law, Gods wrath againſt her, the boldneſſe of the diuell ouer her, the priſon of hell, and all other her euils) are become mine, and are in my power to doe what I liſt with them. Wherefore it is at my choice to deale with them at my pleaſure, and therefore I will put out the hand-writing which is

againſt the ſoule my wife, I will take it out of the way, I will faſten it to my croſſe in mine owne body, and in the ſame will I ſpoile principalities and powers, and make a ſhew of them openly, and triumph ouer them, and conſume them vtterly vnto nothing.</p>
            <p>Now when God ſaw his Sonne, who knew no ſinne, neither had any ſinne in him, thus willingly taking on him the fouleneſſe of our iniquity, he made him to be ſinne for vs, euen the very ſacrifice for our ſinne: and did ſharply puniſh our ſinne in him, putting him to death, euen the death of the Croſſe.

Phil. 2.</note> and obedient Sonne, he would not leaue him to death, nor ſuffer his holy One to ſee corruption: but raiſed him vp from death to life, giuing him all power in heauen and earth, and ſet him at his right hand in glory. Now then the wife likewiſe with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great ioy, doth ſay: The Realmes and Kingdomes of my moſt deare husband and Sauiour are mine, by him I am an heire of Heauen, my husbands riches (that is to wit, his holineſſe, his innocency, his righteouſneſſe and his Godhead, together with all his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and might) are mine and for me: and therefore in him I am holy, innocent, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and godly, and there is not any ſpot in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7709:14"/>
me. I am well-fauoured and faire, inaſmuch as my lawfull husband hath not any blemiſh in him, but is altogether goodly &amp; faire. And ſith that he is wholly mine, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all that he hath is mine, and all that he hath is pure and holy; it followeth that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo am pure and holy. Therefore to begin at his moſt innocent birth: he hath thereby ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified the birth of his Spouſe conceiued in ſinne. The godly child-hood and youth of the Bridegroome, hath iuſtified the childiſh and youthfull life of his dearely beloued Bride. For the loue and vnion that is betwixt the ſoule of a true Chriſtian, and the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome Ieſus Chriſt, maketh all the workes of either of them, to be common to them both. By reaſon whereof, when a man ſaith, Ieſus Chriſt hath faſted, Ieſus Chriſt hath prayed, Ieſus Chriſt was heard of the Father, raiſed the dead, draue diuels out of men, healed the ſicke, dyed, roſe againe, and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heauen: Likewiſe a man may ſay, that a Chriſtian man hath done all the ſelfe-ſame workes, forſomuch as the workes of Chriſt are the workes of the Chriſtian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hath done them for him. Verily a man may ſay that the Chriſtian hath bin nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Croſſe, buried, raiſed againe, is gone vp into heauen, become the child of God, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7709:15"/>
made partaker of the Godhead. On the other ſide all the works that a Chriſtian man doth, are Chriſts workes, becauſe it is his will to take them for his. And foraſmuch as they be vnperfect, and he throughly perfect, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with any vnperfect thing: he hath made them perfect with his vertues, to the end that his wife ſhould be alwayes ioyfull and well contented, and not be afraid of any thing, aſſuring her ſelfe, that although there be yet ſtill ſome default in her workes, yet notwithſtanding they be acceptable to God in reſpect of his Sonne, vpon whom he hath his eyes alwayes faſtened. O that vnmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodneſſe of God! How greatly is the Chriſtian bound vnto God? there is no loue of man, be it neuer ſo great, that may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the loue that God beareth to the ſoule of euery faithfull Chriſtian, whereof Chriſt is the Bridegroome. Whereupon S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that Ieſus Chriſt hath ſo loued his wife the Church,</hi> which is builded of liuing <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.</note> ſtones (that is, of the ſoules of the beleeuing Chriſtians) that for to ſanctifie her, he hath offered himſelfe to the death of the Croſſe, cleanſing her with the waſhing of water, by his Word, to ioyne her to himſelfe a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Church, without ſpot or wrinkle or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like thing: but that ſhe ſhould be holy
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7709:15"/>
and vnblameable (that is to wit, like vnto him in holineſſe and innocency) and alſo bee the true and lawfull daughter of God, who hath loued the world ſo well, that (as Ieſus Chriſt <note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note> himſelfe ſaith) hee hath giuen his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne, to the end that euery one which beleeued in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue life euerlaſting. For God ſent not his Son into the world, to condemne the world: but to the end that the World might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him, inſomuch that hee which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him, ſhall not be damned. Some man <note place="margin">How the faithfull mans ſoule is aſſured of his being married vnto Chriſt.</note> might demand after what manner the vnion of this holy Marriage is made, and how the Soule which is the Bride, and her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome Ieſus Chriſt, are knit together? What aſſurance can I haue, that my ſoule is vnited vnto Ieſus Chriſt, and become his Spouſe? How can I aſſuredly glory that I am Queene and Miſtreſſe of his great riches, as a wife may? I can eaſily beleeue that other folkes ſhall receiue this honour and glory: but I cannot perſwade my ſelfe that I am one of thoſe ſame to whom God hath giuen ſo great grace: For I know mine owne wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe &amp; imperfection. My deare-beloued brother, I anſwer thee, that thine aſſurance conſiſteth in true and liuely faith, wherewith (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith) <hi>God cleanſeth mens hearts:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 5.</note>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:7709:16"/>
And this faith is grounded in the beleeuing of the Goſpell, that is to ſay, in the beleeuing of the glad tidings which haue bin publiſhed on Gods behalfe thorow the whole world: which tidings containeth in effect, that God hath vſed the rigorouſneſſe of his iuſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">Matth. 2.</note> Ieſus Chriſt, chaſtiſing and puniſhing all our ſinnes in him. And whoſoeuer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this good tidings, and beleeues it ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly, hath the true faith, and doth enioy the forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes, and is alſo recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto God: and of the child of wrath, is become the child of Grace: and recouering the Image of God, entreth into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and is made the Temple of <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> God, who marrieth mans ſoule to his onely Sonne, by the meane of this faith, which faith is a worke of God, and the gift of God, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith oftentimes. And God giueth it vnto thoſe whom he calleth to him, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to iuſtifie them, and to glorifie them, and to giue them euerlaſting life, according as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt witneſſeth, ſaying: This is the will of him that ſent mee, euen that euery one which ſeeth the Sonne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth <note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> in him, ſhould haue euerlaſting life, and I will raiſe him vp againe at the latter day. And like as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted vp the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the Wilderneſſe: ſo muſt the Sonne <note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:7709:16"/>
of man bee lifted vp, to the end that euery one which beleeueth in him, might not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but haue life euerlaſting. Alſo he ſaith to <hi>Martha:</hi> He that beleeueth in me, ſhall liue, <note place="margin">Iohn 11.</note> although he were dead, and euery one that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and beleeueth in mee, ſhall not dye for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And to a company of the <hi>Iewes</hi> he ſaith: I am come a light into the world, to the end that euery man which beleeueth in me, ſhould <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 12.</note> not abide in darkeneſſe. And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle ſaith: Herein appeared the loue of God <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4.</note> towards vs, for that God is loue, and ſent his onely begotten Son into this world, that we might liue through him. And herein is loue knowne, not in that we loued God, but in that he loued vs, and ſent his Son to make atonement for our ſinnes. And moreouer he ſent him to deſtroy our enemies. For the bringing whereof to paſſe, he made him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of our fleſh, and of our blood, as ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to the end that by his death, hee might deſtroy him that had the dominion of <note place="margin">Heb. 2.</note> death, that is to wit, the diuell, and ſet all ſuch at liberty, as were ſubiect to bondage all their life long, for feare of death. Seeing then that we haue records of the holy Scripture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the promiſes, whereof we haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heretofore, and concerning many other promiſes that are diſperſed in diuers places
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7709:17"/>
of the ſame: wee cannot doubt of it. And forſomuch as the holy Scripture ſpeaketh to all in generall, none of vs ought to diſtruſt in himſelfe, that the ſelfe-ſame thing which the Scripture ſaith, ſhould not belong particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to himſelfe. And to the end that this point, wherein lyeth and conſiſteth the whole miſtery of our holy faith, may be vnderſtood the better: let vs put the caſe that ſome good and holy King cauſe the Proclamation to be <note place="margin">A very goodly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, &amp; fit for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of the free for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes for Ieſus Chriſts ſake.</note> made thorow his whole Realme by the ſound of a Trumpet, that all Rebels and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed men ſhall ſafely returne home to their houſes, becauſe that at the ſuite and deſert of ſome deare friend of theirs, it hath pleaſed him to pardon them: certainly none of thoſe Rebels ought to doubt of the obtaining of true pardon of his rebellion, but rather ought aſſuredly to returne home to his houſe, to liue vnder the ſhadow of that holy King. And if he will not returne, he ſhall beare the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it, becauſe that through his owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe hee dyeth in exile and in the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Prince. But this good King is the Lord of Heauen and Earth, who for the obedience and deſert of our good brother Ieſus Chriſt, hath pardoned vs all our ſins, and (as we haue ſaid afore) hath made open Proclamation thorow the whold world, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7709:17"/>
all of vs may ſafely returne into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Wherefore he that beleeueth this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, doth ſtraight-wayes returne into Gods kingdome (whereout we were driuen by the offence of our firſt parents,) and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly gouerned by Gods holy Spirit. And he that giueth no credit to the ſaid proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall neuer inioy the ſaid generall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: but for his vnbeliefes fake ſhall abide in baniſhment vnder the tyranny of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and liue and dye in extreme miſery, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and dying in the diſpleaſure of the King of heauen and earth: and that iuſtly. For we cannot commit a greater offence againſt this good God, then to account him as a lyer and deceiuer: which verily wee doe, in not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing credit to his promiſes. O how paſſing heauy is this deadly ſinne of vnbeliefe? which (ſo farre forth as is poſſible) bereaueth God of his glory and perfection: beſides the great harme that it doth to a mans ſelfe, which is his owne damnation and the endleſſe torment of his ſoule, which the miſerable conſcience feeleth euen in this life. But on the contrary, hee that commeth vnto GOD with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſſe of this faith, beleeuing him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any miſtruſt or doubt of his promiſes, and warranting himſelfe for a certaintie, that God will performe all that euer hee hath
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7709:18"/>
promiſed him: giueth all the glory vnto God, and liueth continually in reſt and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ioy, euermore praiſing and thanking the Lord God, for chooſing him to the glory of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note> the eternall life. And hereof they haue an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured earneſt penny and gage, that is to wit, the Sonne of God, whom they take for their moſt louing Bridegroome, the blood of whom, hath made their hearts ſo drunken, that through this paſſing holy beliefe, there is in the Chriſtian heart ingendred ſo liuely a hope, and ſo certaine a truſt of Gods mercy towards vs, and ſuch an operation is wrought in vs, as we reſt our ſelues wholly vpon God, leauing the whole care of vs vnto him in ſuch wiſe, that being throughly aſſured of Gods good will, wee are not afraid, neither of the diuell, nor of his miniſters, nor of death. Which holy and ſtedfaſt truſt of Gods mercy, inlargeth our heart, cheereth it vp, and with certaine marueilous ſweet affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons directeth it vnto GOD, filling it and ſetting it on fire with an exceeding feruent loue. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> incourageth vs to <note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> go with all boldneſſe to the Throne of grace: and hee counſelleth vs that wee ſhould not ſhake it off, nor make light of our truſt, which hath great recompence &amp; reward. But this ſo holy and diuine affiance is gendred in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7709:18"/>
our hearts by the working of the H. Ghoſt, who is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated vnto vs by faith, which <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> neuer goeth without the loue of God. And hereof it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, that we be prouoked to do good works with a certaine liuelineſſe &amp; effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall cheerefulneſſe: whereby we gather ſuch a ſtrength &amp; inclination to do them, as we be throughly ready &amp; forward, to do &amp; ſuffer all intolerable things for the loue &amp; glory of our moſt gracious &amp; mercifull Father, who hath inriched vs with ſo abundant grace through Ieſus Chriſt, and of his enemies made vs his moſt deare children. This true faith is no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner giuen a man, but hee is by and by indued and imprinted with a certaine violent loue of good works, to yeeld right ſweet and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fruits both vnto God &amp; likewiſe to his neighbour, as a very good and fruitfull tree. And it is no more poſſible that he ſhould be otherwiſe, then it is poſſible that a fagot ſhould be ſet on fire, &amp; not caſt light immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly. This is the holy faith, without the which it is vnpoſſible that any man ſhould pleaſe <note place="margin">Heb. 8.</note> God, &amp; whereby all the holy men (as well of the old Teſtament as of the New) haue bin ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, according as S. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> concerning whom, the Scripture ſaith, That <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued God, and it was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to him for righteouſnes. And therfore <note place="margin">Rom. 4. Gen. 15.</note>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:7709:19"/>
he ſaith a little before: We beleeue that a <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> man is iuſtified by faith without the deeds of the Law. And in another place he ſaith: So then, in that time ſhall the remnant be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, according to the election of grace: and if they be ſaued by grace, then is it not by workes, for then were grace no grace. And to the <hi>Galatiaus</hi> he ſaith, It is a manifeſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that no man becommeth righteous before <note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> God by the Law, becauſe the righteous liueth by faith. And the Law conſiſteth not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, <note place="margin">Abac. 2.</note> but he that performeth the things that the Law commandeth, ſhall liue by that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. And further he ſaith, that a man <note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> cannot become righteous by the deeds of the Law, but onely by beleeuing in Ieſus Chriſt. Againe, a little after he ſaith, that if a man can become righteous by the Law, Ieſus Chriſt dyed in vaine. Moreouer to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> making compariſon betweene the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law, and the righteouſneſſe of <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> the Goſpel, he ſaith, that the one conſiſteth in the doing of workes, and the other in beleeuing. For if thou confeſſe our Lord Ieſus Chriſt with thy mouth, and beleeue in thy heart that God hath raiſed him vp from death, thou ſhalt be ſaued. For the beliefe of the heart maketh a man righteous, and the confeſſion of the mouth maketh him ſafe.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7709:19"/>
Loe how this good teacher Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euidently, that faith maketh a man righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous without any workes. And not only Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> but alſo the holy Doctors that came after him, haue confirmed and allowed this moſt holy truth of Iuſtification by faith: among whom Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is the chiefe, <note place="margin">S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.</hi>
               </note> who in his booke of faith and workes, and in his booke of the Spirit and the Letter, and in his booke of foureſcore and three queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in his booke which he did write to <hi>Boniface,</hi> and in his Treatiſe vpon the xxxj. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and in many other places, defendeth this article, ſhewing that we become righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by faith without any helpe of good workes: howbeit that good workes are the effects of righteouſneſſe, and not the cauſe of it. And he ſheweth that the words of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> being ſoundly vnderſtood, are nothing contrary to this article. Which thing <hi>Origen</hi> doth alſo affirme in his fourth booke vpon <note place="margin">Origen.</note> the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſaying, that Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning is, that faith onely is ſufficient to make men righteous, inſomuch that a man becommeth righteous, onely by beleeuing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he haue not done any good worke at all. For ſo it is, that the thiefe became righteous without the workes of the Law, foraſmuch as the Lord ſought not what
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7709:20"/>
good workes he had done in time paſt, nor waited vntill he had done any after he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, but hauing accepted him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, vpon his onely confeſſion, tooke him for his companion, euen when he ſhould enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Likewiſe, that ſo renowmed a <note n="*" place="margin">Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</note> woman in the Goſpel of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> while ſhe was at the feete of Ieſus Chriſt, heard it ſaid vnto her, Thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee. And a little after he ſaith vnto her, Thy faith hath <note place="margin">Luke 6.</note> ſaued thee, goe thy way in peace. Afterward <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, In many places of the Goſpel, a man may ſee how our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ſpoken in ſuch wiſe, as he ſheweth that faith is the cauſe of the ſaluation of the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. Then is a man made righteous by faith, and the workes of the Law further him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. On the contrary, where faith is not (which faith maketh the beleeuer righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous) although a man doe the workes which the Law commandeth: yet notwithſtanding, foraſmuch as they be not builded vpon the foundation of faith, albeit that to outward appearance they ſeeme good, yet can they not iuſtifie him that doth them, becauſe he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">Faith is the mark of thoſe that are iuſtified.</note> faith, which is the marke of them that are become righteous before God. And who is he that can boaſt himſelfe to be righteous, when he heareth God ſay by his Prophet
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7709:20"/>
               <hi>Eſay,</hi> that all our righteouſneſſe is as a defiled <note place="margin">Eſay. 64.</note> cloth of a menſtruous woman? Then can we not iuſtly glory in our ſelues, but in the onely faith of the croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> in his Homily of humility, ſaith that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <note place="margin">S. <hi>Baſil.</hi>
               </note> ought to hold himſelfe for righteous through beliefe in Ieſus Chriſt: and his words are theſe: The Apoſtle ſaith, that he which glorieth, ſhould glory in the Lord, in that God hath made Ieſus Chriſt to be our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the end, that he which would glory, ſhould glory in the Lord, becauſe that the perfect and ſound glorying, is to glory in the Lord. For in ſo doing, a man preſumeth not vpon his owne righteouſneſſe, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth his want of the true righteouſnes, &amp; that he is made righteous, onely by beleeuing in Ieſus Chriſt. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> gloryeth of the deſpiſing of his owne righteouſneſſe, and of his ſeeking of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, by faith, which commeth of God. Saint <hi>Hilary,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">S. <hi>Hilary.</hi>
               </note> in his ninth Canon, vpon the expoſition of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith theſe words: The Scribes conſidering Ieſus Chriſt but onely as man, were troubled that a man ſhould forgiue ſins, and pardon that thing which the Law could not doe, becauſe that onely faith iuſtifieth. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in expounding theſe words of

Saint <hi>Paul (Vnto him that beleeueth in him</hi>

               <hi>which iuſtifieth the vngodly, his faith is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for righteouſneſſe, according to the purpoſe of Gods Grace:</hi> like as <hi>David</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>That the man is bleſſed whom God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth righteous without workes)</hi> writeth thus, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that vnto him which beleeueth in Ieſus Chriſt (that is to wit, to the <hi>Gentile)</hi> his faith is imputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, as it was vnto <hi>Abraham.</hi> In what wiſe then thinke the Iewes to become righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous by the workes of the Law: and yet to be righteous as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, ſeeing that <hi>Abraham</hi> became not righteous by the deeds of the Law, but onely by faith? Then is not the Law needfull, foraſmuch as the ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth righteous before God through on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, according to Gods gracious purpoſe, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith. The Apoſtle confirmeth that which he hath ſaid, by the Prophets exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaying: Bleſſed is the man whom God <note place="margin">Pſal. 31.</note> accepteth for righteous without workes: whereby <hi>David</hi> meaneth, that thoſe men are very happy, whom GOD hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to accept for righteous before him, by onely faith, without any paines-taking or obſeruation of the Law on their behalfe. Thus ſheweth he the bleſſedneſſe of the time wherein Chriſt was borne, inſomuch as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7709:21"/>
the Lord himſelfe ſaith; Many righteous men and Prophets haue coueted to ſee the things that you ſee, and to heare the things that you heare, and haue not heard them. The ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame thing ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in expounding the firſt Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> affirming openly, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer beleeueth in Ieſus Chriſt, is become righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous without workes, and without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and receiueth forgiuenaſſe of his ſinnes by faith alone. Alſo he affirmeth the ſame thing in an Epiſtle which he writeth to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> ſaying, Let no man boaſt of his owne workes, for no man becommeth righteous by his owne workes: but he that hath righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, hath it of free gift, forſomuch as he is made righteous by Ieſus Chriſt. Then is it faith that deliuereth by Chriſts blood: for happy is he whoſe ſinne is forgiuen and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. And S. <hi>Bernard</hi> in his threeſcore and ſeuenteenth Sermon vpon the Ballet of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, <note place="margin">S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi>
               </note> confirmeth the ſame, ſaying that our owne merits beare no ſway at all, in making vs righteous, which thing muſt be attributed wholly vnto grace, which maketh vs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous freely, and likewiſe diſchargeth vs from the bondage of ſinne. And he addeth, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt marrieth the ſoule, and coupleth it vnto himſelfe by faith, without that, any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon how we be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt.</note> ſhrowded himſelfe vnder the apparell of his brother, and clothed himſelfe with his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which yeelded a very ſweet ſent, and in that wiſe preſented himſelfe to his father, to receiue the bleſſing vnder another mans perſon to his owne behoofe: euen ſo is it requiſit for vs to clothe our ſelues with the righteouſneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt by faith, and to ſhrowd ourſelues vnder the diuine pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our eldeſt brother, if we will be receiued for righteous afore God. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely this is true. For if we appeare before God vnclothed of the righteouſneſſe of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, out of all doubt we ſhall be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged worthy of euerlaſting damnation. But contrariwiſe, if God ſee vs apparelled with the righteouſneſſe of his Sonne Chriſt: then will he ſurely take vs for righteous, and holy, and worthy of eternall life. And verily it is a great raſhneſſe in ſuch as pretend to attaine to righteouſneſſe by the keeping of Gods
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7709:22"/>
Commandements, which are all comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in louing God, with all our heart, with all our ſoule, and with all our ſtrength, and our neighbour as our ſelfe. But who is ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant <note place="margin">No man can boaſt of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Gods Law.</note> or ſo mad as to preſume, that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to performe thoſe Commandements to the full? Or who ſeeth not that Gods Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth perfect loue, and condemneth all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectneſſe? Let euery man conſider well his owne workes, which partly ſhall ſeeme good vnto him, and he ſhall find that they ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be called tranſgreſſions of that moſt holy Law, according alſo as they be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vncleane and vnperfit, ſo that he muſt be faine to vtter this ſaying of <hi>Dauids:</hi> Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruant, O <note place="margin">Pſal. 143.</note> Lord, for no man liuing ſhall be found righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in thy ſight.

And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, If we ſay we be without ſinne, <note place="margin">1 Iohn 2.</note> wee deceiue our ſelnes. And ſpecially our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt teacheth vs to ſay,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7709:23"/>
as often as we pray, <hi>Forgiue vs all our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> 
               <hi>as we forgiue them that treſpaſſe againſt vs.</hi> And hereby may well be gathered the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe that make marchandiſe of their workes, preſuming to ſaue by them, not onely themſelues, but alſo their neighbours: as though our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had not ſaid vnto them, When ye haue done all that euer <note place="margin">Luke 17.</note> is commanded you, ſay ye, We be vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeruants, we haue done but as we ought to doe. Ye ſee that although we had performed Gods Law to the full, yet neuertheleſſe we ſhould eſteeme and call our ſelues vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeruants. Now then, ſeeing that men are ſo farre off from this full performance: who is he that dareth be ſo bold as to glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he hath added ſo great an ouerplus of deſeruings aboue the full meaſure, as he may haue to deale abroad vnto others? But to returne to our purpoſe, I would that the proud ſinner which beareth himſelfe in hand that he maketh himſelfe righteous before God, by doing ſome works which are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the world, would conſider, that all the workes which proceed out of an vncleane and foule heart, are alſo vncleane and filthy, and conſequently cannot be acceptable vnto God, nor haue any power to make the party righteous. Therefore we muſt firſt of all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7709:23"/>
cleanſe the heart, if we mind that our workes ſhould pleaſe God. The cleanſing of the heart proceedeth of faith, as the holy Ghoſt affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by the mouth of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter.</hi> Then muſt <note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> we not ſay that the vnrighteous perſon and the ſinner becommeth righteous, good, and acceptable vnto God by his owne workes: but we muſt of neceſſity conclude, that faith cleanſeth our hearts, and maketh vs good, righteous and acceptable before God, and furthermore cauſeth our workes to pleaſe him, notwithſtanding that they be altogether vnprofitable and vnperfit. For inaſmuch as we be become the children of God through faith: he conſidereth our workes, not as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere and rigorous Iudge, but as a moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Father, hauing pitty of our fraileneſſe, and regarding vs as the members of his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonne, whoſe perfection and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth ſupply all our vncleanneſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, which are not layed to our charge, forſomuch as they be couered vnder the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and innocency of Ieſus Chriſt, and come not to iudgement before God. And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">How the workes of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, thogh they bee vnperfect, pleaſe God.</note> it commeth to paſſe, that all our workes which proceed of true faith, (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they be wholly ſinfull and corrupt of themſelues) ſhall neuertheleſſe be praiſed and allowed by Ieſus Chriſt in the generall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7709:24"/>
iudgement, becauſe they be the fruits and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of our faith whereby we be ſaued. For inſomuch as we haue loued the brethren of Ieſus Chriſt, we ſhall ſhew euidently, that we haue alſo beene faithfull, and brethren of Chriſt, and therefore by faith, we ſhall be put in full poſſeſſion of the euerlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which our Soueraigne Lord God hath prepared for vs before the creating of the <note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> world: not for our merits ſake, but through his mercy, whereby he hath choſen vs, and called vs to the Grace of his Goſpell, and made vs righteous, to the intent to glorifie vs euerlaſtingly with his onely begotten Son Ieſus Chriſt, who is the holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of vs, but not of them which will not confeſſe that faith is ſufficient of it ſelfe to make a man righteous and acceptable to the Lord God, who through his Fatherly goodneſſe and louing kindneſſe, offereth and giueth vs Ieſus Chriſt with his righteouſnes, without any deſert of our owne workes. What thing can worke or cauſe a man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue ſo great a gift and treaſure as Ieſus Chriſt is? This treaſure is giuen only through <note place="margin">In what manner faith iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth.</note> the grace, fauour, and mercifulneſſe of God: and onely faith is the thing that receiueth ſuch a gift, as to make vs inioy the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes. And therefore when S.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7709:24"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> and other Doctors ſay, that onely faith maketh men righteous, without works: they meane that it maketh vs to enioy the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and to receiue Ieſus Chriſt, who (as ſaith S. <hi>Paul)</hi> dwelleth <note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.</note> in our hearts by faith, and ouercomming and pacifying the troubles of our conſciences, ſatisfieth Gods iuſtice for our ſinnes. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore it appeaſeth Gods wrath iuſtly moued againſt vs, quencheth the fire of hell, whereinto our naturall corruption did throw vs headlong, and cheerefully deſtroyeth and ouerthroweth the diuell, together with all his power and tyranny: Which things, all the workes that all the men in the world can lay together, are not able to deſerue nor to bring to paſſe. That glory and that prerogatiue is reſerued all onely to the Sonne of God, that is to wit, to the bleſſed Ieſus Chriſt, who hath power aboue all the powers that are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, in Earth, and in Hell, and giueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his merits, to all ſuch as diſtruſting in themſelues, doe ſet their whole hope of being ſaued, in him and in his merits. And therefore let no man beguile himſelfe when he heareth it ſaid, that onely faith iuſtifieth without workes: and thinke as falſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doe (who draw all things to liue fleſhly) that the true faith conſiſteth in beleeuing the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7709:25"/>
bare ſtory of Ieſus Chriſt, after the ſame manner as men beleeue the ſtory of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Alexander.</hi> Such manner of beleefe is but an hiſtoricall beleefe, grounded meerely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the report of men, and vpon their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and lightly imprinted in our conceit by a certaine cuſtome, and is like to the faith of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who for the like reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the fables of their <hi>Alcoran.</hi> And ſuch a faith is but an imagination of man, which neuer renueth the heart of man, nor warmeth it with the loue of God, neither do any good workes inſue, or any change of life which faith ſhould bring forth. And therefore they falſly hold opinion againſt the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and againſt the holy Doctors of the Church, that onely faith maketh not men righteous, but that they muſt alſo haue workes. Vnto whom I anſwer, That this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall and fond beliefe, and all the workes that inſue thereof, are not onely vnable to make a man righteous: but alſo doe caſt the parties headlong to the bottome of hell, like vnto thoſe that haue no oyle in their lamps, that is to ſay, no liuely faith in their hearts. <note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> The faith that maketh men righteous, is a worke of God in vs, whereby our old man <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> is crucified, and we being transformed in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, become new creatures, and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7709:25"/>
deare beloued children of God. This heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith is it that graffeth vs into the death and reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently mortifieth our fleſh with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and luſts thereof. For when we by the operation of faith doe know our ſelues to be dead with Ieſus Chriſt, wee are at a full point with our ſelues and with the world, and are throughly reſolued, how it is meet that they which are dead with Ieſus Chriſt, ſhould mortifie their earthly members, that is to wit, the ſinfull affections of their minde, and the luſts of the fleſh: and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as wee know wee bee raiſed againe with Chriſt, we bend our ſelues to the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a ſpirituall and holy life, like vnto that which we ſhall liue in heauen, after the laſt reſurrection. This holy faith making vs to inioy the generall pardon that is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Goſpell, bringeth vs into the kingdome of our good God, and pacifieth our conſciences, maintaining vs in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ioy, and holy and ſpirituall ſweetneſſe. This ſelfe-ſame faith knitteth vs vnto God, and maketh him to dwell in our hearts, and clotheth our ſoule with himſelfe, ſo as thenceforth the holy Ghoſt mooueth vs to doe the ſame things whereunto hee mooued Ieſus Chriſt while he was in the world, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7709:26"/>
was conuerſant among men, that is to wit, vnto lowlineſſe, meekeneſſe, obedientneſſe vnto God, louingneſſe, and other perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where-through wee recouer the image of God. For theſe ſelfe-ſame cauſes, Ieſus Chriſt did rightly attribute bleſſedneſſe vnto this inſpired faith: which bleſſedneſſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee without good workes and holineſſe of life. And how can it be that a Chriſtian ſhould not become holy, ſeeing that Ieſus Chriſt is become his holineſſe through faith? Therefore by faith we be iuſtified and ſaued, and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth in a manner alwaies <note place="margin">Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them Saints, whom we call Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> call thoſe Saints, whom we call now Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: who, if they haue not Chriſts Spirit, are none of Chriſts, and conſequently no Chriſtians at all. But if they haue the Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt to rule and gouerne them, we muſt not doubt, but that although they know well that they bee made righteous through faith onely: yet for all that, they will <note place="margin">He that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee without good works.</note> become neuer the more ſlothfull to do good works. For Chriſts Spirit is the Spirit of loue: and loue cannot be idle, nor ceaſe from the doing of good works. But if wee will ſay the truth, a man can doe no good works, except he firſt know himſelfe to be become righteous by faith: for before he knoweth that, his doing of good works is rather to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7709:26"/>
make himſelfe righteous, then for the loue and glory of God: and ſo he defileth all his works with ſelfe-loue, for the loue of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and for his owne profit. But hee that knoweth himſelfe to be become righteous by the merits and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, (which hee maketh his owne by faith) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth happily, and doth good works, all only for the loue and glory of Chriſt, and not for loue of himſelfe, nor to make himſelfe righteous. And thereupon it commeth, that the true Chriſtian, (that is to wit, he that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth himſelfe righteous by reaſon of Chriſts righteouſneſſe) asketh not whether good works be commanded or not: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly moued and prouoked with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine violence of godly loue, he offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe willingly to doe all the works that are holy and Chriſtian-like, and neuer ceaſeth to doe well. Hee therefore which feeleth not the marueilous effects by his faith, which we haue heretofore declared, that the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red faith works in the heart of the Chriſtian: Let him aſſure himſelfe, that he hath not the Chriſtian faith, and let him pray earneſtly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God to giue it him, ſaying: <hi>Lord helpe mine vnbeliefe.</hi> And when he heareth it ſaid, that <note place="margin">Marke 2.</note> only faith maketh men righteous, let him not deceiue himſelfe, and ſay, What need I to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7709:27"/>
weary my ſelfe in doing good works, faith is inough to ſend mee to <hi>Paradiſe?</hi> To ſuch an one I anſwer, that only faith ſendeth vs to <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> but yet let him take good heed: for the diuels doe alſo beleeue and tremble, as ſaith Saint <hi>Iames:</hi> O miſerable man, wilt thou <note place="margin">Iames 2.</note> goe with them to <hi>Paradiſe?</hi> By this falſe concluſion thou mayeſt know (my brother) in what an errour thou art: for thou wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to haue the faith that maketh men righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and thou haſt it not. Thou ſayeſt thou <note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> art rich, and haſt no need of any thing: and thou ſeeſt not how thou art poore, wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, blind, and naked. I counſell to buy gold of God, that is throughly fixed with fire, (that is to ſay, true faith ſet on fire with good works) to the intent thou mayeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich: and to cloath thy ſelfe with white rayment (that is to wit, with Chriſts inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency) to the end that the ſhame of thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe (which is the great filthineſſe of thy <note place="margin">A liuely compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> ſins) be not ſeene to the whole world. Then is the iuſtifying faith as it were a flame of fire, which cannot but caſt forth brightneſſe. And like as the flame burneth the wood without the helpe of the light, and yet the flame cannot be without the light: ſo is it aſſuredly true, that faith alone conſumeth and burneth away ſinne without the helpe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7709:27"/>
of workes, and yet that the ſame faith cannot be without good workes. Wherefore, like as if we ſee a flame of fire that giueth no light, we know by and by that it is but vaine and painted: euen ſo, when we ſee not ſome light of good workes in a man, it is a token that he hath not the true inſpired faith, which God giueth to his choſen, to iuſtifie and glorifie them withall. And hold it for certaine, that S. <hi>Iames</hi> meant ſo, when hee <note place="margin">What S. <hi>James</hi> meant concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning workes. Iames 2.</note> ſaid, Shew me thy faith by thy workes, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my workes. For his meaning was, that he which is plunged in ambitiouſneſſe, and worldly pleaſures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth not (though he ſay he beleeue) foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he ſheweth not in himſelfe the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of faith. Alſo we may liken this holy faith to the Godhead which is in Ieſus <note place="margin">A hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> Chriſt: who being very man (but without ſin) did wonderfull things, healing the ſicke, giuing ſight to the blind, walking vpon the water, and raiſing vp the dead vnto life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: and yet theſe marueilous workes were not the cauſe that he was God. For before he did any of thoſe things, he was God, and the lawfull and onely begotten Son of God, and he need not to worke thoſe miracles to make himſelfe God by them, but foraſmuch as he was God, therefore he did them. And
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7709:28"/>
ſo, the miracles that Chriſt wrought, made him not to be God, but ſhewed openly that he was God. In like wiſe, true faith is as it were a Godhead in the ſoule of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, which doth wondrous workes, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer weary of well-doing, and yet thoſe workes are not the cauſe that a Chriſtian is a Chriſtian, that is to wit, that he is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, good, holy, and acceptable vnto God, neither needeth he to worke all thoſe good workes to become ſuch a one. But foraſmuch as hee is a Chriſtian by faith, like as Ieſus Chriſt being a man, was alſo God by his Godhead: he doth all thoſe good workes, which make not the Chriſtian to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and good, but ſhew him to bee good, righteous and holy. So then, like as Chriſts Godhead was the cauſe that he wrought miracies: euen ſo faith working through loue, is the cauſe of the good workes that a Chriſtian man doth. And like as a man may ſay of Ieſus Chriſt, that he hath done this miracle or that, and that thoſe miracles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they glorified God, were alſo a great honor vnto Ieſus Chriſt as he was man, who for his obedience euen vnto death, was recompenced at Gods hand in his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and had giuen vnto him all power both in heauen and earth, which he had not afore as in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7709:28"/>
reſpect of his manhood, but deſerued it by the vnion which is betwixt the Word of God and the manhood of Chriſt: So doth faith in a Chriſtian, which faith by reaſon of the vnion that it hath with the ſoule, attributeth that thing to the one which is proper to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: whereupon it commeth, that the holy Scripture promiſeth the Chriſtian euerlaſting life for his good works, becauſe good works are the fruits and teſtimonies of liuely faith, and proceed of it, as light proceedeth from a flame of fire, according as I haue ſaid hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And by this holy faith which imbraceth Ieſus Chriſt, it comes to paſſe that our ſoule is ioyned with Chriſt, and is ſo vnited and knit to him, that whatſoeuer Chriſt hath merited and deſerued, the ſame is imputed vnto the ſoule, as though it had merited and deſerued it. And therefore S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, that God crowneth his owne gifts in vs. Of this vnion of the ſoule with Ieſus Chriſt, Chriſt himſelfe beareth good record, where hee prayeth to his Father for his Apoſtles and for ſuch as ſhould beleeue in him by their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. I pray not (ſaith he) for them onely, <note place="margin">Ioh. 17.</note> but alſo for all thoſe that ſhall beleeue in me through their word, to the end they may be all one thing, that like as thou my Father art in me, and I in thee, ſo they alſo may be one
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7709:29"/>
in vs, and that the world may beleeue that thou haſt ſent me, and that I haue giuen them the glory which thou haſt giuen me, ſo as they ſhould be one ſelfe-fame thing like as thou and I are one. Whereby it appeareth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that if we beleeue the word of the Apoſtles (who preached that Ieſus Chriſt dyed for our ſins, &amp; roſe againe for our iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) we become all one thing with him: <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> and foraſmuch as he is all one with God, we alſo become all one with God, by the meane <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.</note> of Ieſus Chriſt. O wonderfull glory of the Chriſtian, to whom it is granted through faith, to poſſeſſe the vnſpeakeable benefits which the Angels long to behold! By this preſent diſcourſe a man may plainely perceiue the difference that is betwixt vs &amp; them that defend the iuſtification by faith and workes together. Herein we agree with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we ſtabliſh works, affirming that the faith which iuſtifieth, cannot be without good workes, and that thoſe which are become righteous, are they that doe the good workes that may rightly be called good workes. But we differ from them in this, that we ſay, that faith <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> maketh men righteous without the helpe of workes. And the reaſon is ready: namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by faith we put on Chriſt, &amp; make <note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> his holineſſe and righteouſneſſe to be ours.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7709:29"/>
And ſeeing the caſe ſo ſtandeth, that Chriſts righteouſneſſe is giuen vs by faith: We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo thankleſſe, blind, and vnhappy, as not to beleeue that he is of ſufficient ability, <note place="margin">Heb. 2.</note> to make vs acceptable and right before God. Let vs ſay with the Apoſtle, If the bloud of Oxen and Goats, and the Aſhes of a Cow ſprinkled, cleanſeth the vncleane, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cleanſing of the fleſh: how much more ſhall that bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, who by the euerlaſting ſpirit offered himſelfe vndefiled vnto God, to cleanſe our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from dead workes, to ſerue the liuing God? I pray thee now, thou good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout Chriſtian, conſider well which of theſe two opinions is the trueſt, holieſt, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt to be preached: Ours, which aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the benefit of Ieſus Chriſt, and pulleth downe the pride of man which would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt his owne works againſt Chriſts glory: or the other, which by affirming that faith of it ſelfe iuſtifieth not, defaceth the glory and benefit of Ieſus Chriſt, and puffeth vp the pride of man, who cannot abide to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome merit of his owne. But (ſay they) it is a great quickning vp to good workes, to ſay that a man maketh himſelfe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God by meanes of them. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7709:30"/>
that wee alſo confeſſe that good workes are acceptable to God, and that hee of his meere grace and free liberality recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth them in Paradiſe. But we ſay more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that no workes are good, ſauing thoſe that (S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith) are done by thoſe that are become righteous through faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that if the tree be not good, it cannot yeeld good fruit. And furthermore we ſay that ſuch as are become righteous through faith, foraſmuch as they know themſelues to be righteous through Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe purchaſed by Chriſt, make no bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with God for their workes, as though they would buy their manner of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch as it is with them: but being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the Loue of God, and deſirous to glorifie Ieſus Chiiſt who hath made them righteous, by giuing them his merits and riches, they beſtow all their whole ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and labour to doe Gods will, fighting manfully againſt the loue of themſelues, and againſt the world and the Diuell. And when they fall through frailty of the fleſh, they recouer themſelues by and by, and are ſo much the more deſirous to doe good, and ſo much the more in loue with their God, conſidering that he layeth not their ſinnes to their charge, becauſe they be ingrafted into

Ieſus Chriſt, who hath made full amends for all his members, vpon the tree of his croſſe, and maketh continuall interceſſion for them to the eternall Father, who for the loue of his onely begotten Sonne, beholdeth them alwayes with a gentle countenance, gouerning and defending them as his moſt deare children, and in the end giuing them the heritage of the world, making them like faſhioned to the glorious Image of Chriſt. Theſe louing motions are the ſpurres that pricke forward the true Chriſtians to doe good workes: who conſidering that they are become the children of God through faith, and made partakers of his diuine nature, are ſtirred vp by the holy Ghoſt dwelling in them, to liue as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the children of ſo great a Lord, and are greatly aſhamed that they maintaine not the beauty of their heanenly Nobleneſſe: and therefore they imploy their whole indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to the following of their firſt borne brother Ieſus Chriſt, liuing in great lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and meekeneſſe, in all things ſeeking the glory of God, giuing their liues for their brethren, doing good to their enemies, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in the ſufferance of reproaches, and in the Croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and <note place="margin">Gal. 6.

            <p>keth euery of vs to poſſeſſe Chriſt and all that is his, as wee poſſeſſe our owne gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore to be clothed with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, is nothing elſe but to beleeue for a certainty, that Chriſt is wholly ours: and ſo is he in very deed, if we beleeue ſo, and hold our ſelues aſſured, that by the ſame heauenly garment we bee receiued into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour before God. For it is moſt certaine, that he as a moſt deare Father hath giuen vs his Sonne: meaning that all his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and all that euer he is, can, or hath done, ſhould be in our power and iuriſdiction, in ſuch wiſe as it ſhould bee lawfull for vs to make our boaſt of them, as if we had done, purchaſed, and deſerued them by our owne ſtrength. And whoſoeuer beleeueth this, ſhall find that his beleefe is good and true, as we haue ſhewed heretofore. Then muſt the Chriſtian haue a ſtedfaſt faith and beleefe, that all the goods, all the graces, and all the riches of Ieſus Chriſt, are his: for ſith that God hath giuen vs Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, how ſhould it be poſſible that hee hath not <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> giuen vs all things with him? Now if this be true, as true it is in deed: the Chriſtian may rightly ſay, I am the childe of God, and Ieſus Chriſt is my brother. I am Lord of Heauen and Earth, and of hell, and of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7709:31"/>
death, and of the law, in ſo much as the law cannot accuſe me nor lay any curſe vpon mee, becauſe the righteouſneſſe of God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mine. And this faith is it alone that maketh a man to be called a Chriſtian, and which cloatheth him with Ieſus Chriſt as we haue ſaid afore. And boldly may this be called a great myſtery, whereunder are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained marueilous things, and things not heard of, concerning that great God, which cannot enter into mans heart, except God doe firſt ſoften it with his holy grace, as he hath promiſed to doe by his holy Prophet, ſaying, I will giue you a new heart, and I will put a new minde into you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your body, and I will giue you a heart of fleſh. Now then, hee that beleeueth not after the ſaid manner, that Ieſus Chriſt with all the goods that he poſſeſſeth, is his, cannot call himſelfe a true Chriſtian, nor euer haue a quiet and ioyfull conſcience, nor a good and feruent courage to doe good: but ſhall eaſily faint in doing of good works, yea and moreouer hee ſhall neuer bee able to doe workes that are truely good. This onely beleefe and truſt that wee haue in the merits of Ieſus Chriſt, maketh men true Chriſtians, ſtout, cheerefull, merry, louers of God, ready to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7709:32"/>
doe good works, poſſeſſors of Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and of God himſelfe, and his right deare-beloued children, in whom the holy Ghoſt doth truely dwell. What heart is ſo cowardly, cold, and vile, which conſidering <note place="margin">Ieſus Chriſt the true example of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> the ineſtimable greatneſſe of the gift that God hath beſtowed vpon him, in giuing him his owne ſo well-beloued Sonne with all his perfectneſſe, is not inflamed with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding earneſt deſire, to become like vnto him in good works: ſpecially ſeeing that the Father hath giuen him vnto vs for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whereon we muſt continually looke, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our life after ſuch a ſort, as it may be a true counterpaine of the life of Ieſus Chriſt, foraſmuch as Chriſt (as ſaith Saint <hi>Peter)</hi> hath ſuffered for vs, leauing vs an <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.</note> enſample, to the end that we ſhould follow his footſteps? Out of this conſideration iſſueth another kinde of cloathing of a mans ſelfe with Chriſt, which we may tearme an example cloathing, for ſo much as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian muſt frame his whole life after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt, faſhioning himſelfe like vnto him in all his deedes, words and thoughts, leauing his former wicked life, and decking himſelfe with the new life, that is to wit, with the life of Chriſt. By reaſon <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. Rom. 15.</note> whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: Let vs caſt away
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7709:32"/>
the works of darkneſſe, and put on the armour of light, not in feaſting, nor in drunkenneſſe, nor in chambring and wantonnes, nor in ſtrife: but put vpon you the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and make no preparation for the fleſh, nor for the luſts thereof. Hereupon the true Chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in loue with Ieſus Chriſt, ſaith in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Sith that Ieſus Chriſt, not hauing any need of me, hath redeemed me with his owne blood, and is become poore to enrich mee: I will likewiſe giue my good, yea and my very life, for the loue and welfare of my neighbour. And like as I am cloathed with Ieſus Chriſt for the loue hee hath borne to mee: ſo will I haue my neighbour in Chriſt, to cloath himſelfe with mee and with my goods likewiſe, for the loue that I beare him for Chriſts ſake. He that doth not ſo, is no true Chriſtian, for hee cannot ſay that hee loueth Ieſus Chriſt, if hee loue not the members and brothers of him: and if we loue not our neighbour, for whoſe ſake Chriſt hath ſhed his blood, wee cannot truely ſay that wee loue Ieſus Chriſt: who beeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with God, was obedient to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> euen to the death of the Croſſe, and hath loued and redeemed vs, giuing himſelfe vnto vs, with all that euer hee hath.

him forſake himſelfe, and take vs his Croſſe and follow me. But the chiefe cauſe of this <note place="margin">Luke 9.</note> croſſe is, for that our God purpoſeth to mortifie the affections of our mind and the luſts of our fleſh by that exerciſe: to the end we may conceiue in our ſelues the great perfection wherein we be comprized by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by being grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Alſo his will is, that our faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fined like gold in the furnace of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <note place="margin">Iohn 15.

Moreouer his intent his, that we by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, ſhould ſet out his great power, which the world in deſpite of it, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in vs, in aſmuch as our frailty becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſtrong by troubles and perſecutions, and the more that it was beaten downe and oppreſſed, ſo much the more it is ſtrong and ſtedfeſt. Whereof the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, We carry this treaſure in earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> that the excellency of the power <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> might be Gods and not ours. On all ſides we ſuffer tribulation, but wee are not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: we be poore, but not ouercome of pouerty: wee ſuffer perſecution, but yet are we not forſaken: we be deſpiſed, but yet wee periſh not: and ſo we dayly beare about vs the dying of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in our body, that the life of Ieſus Chriſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7709:33"/>
may alſo be openly ſhewed in vs. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſe is ſo, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt and all his deare Diſciples glorified God by tribulations: let vs alſo imbrace them ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and ſay with the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> God <note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> forbid that I ſhould glory, ſaue in the Croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and let vs ſo deale, as the world may (whether it will or no) perceiue and ſee with his eyes, the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effects that God worketh in ſuch as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely imbrace the grace of his Goſpell. Let vs ſo deale, I ſay, as the worldlings may ſee with how great quietneſſe of mind the true Chriſtians indure the loſſe of their goods, the death of their children, ſlanders, the diſeaſes of the body, and the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of falſe chriſtians: and alſo that they may ſee how the onely true Chriſtians doe worſhip God in ſpirit and truth, taking in good worth at his hand whatſoeuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and holding all that hee doth, to bee good, righteous and holy, praiſing him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for the ſame, whether it be in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or aduerſity, thanking him as a moſt gracious and louing father, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> it for a right great gift of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſuffer any aduerſity, and chiefly for the Goſpell, and for following the ſteps of Chriſt, ſpecially for as much as we know,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7709:34"/>
that tribulation ingendreth patience, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience <note place="margin">After what ſort patience ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth triall.</note> triall, and triall hope, and hope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs not aſhamed. I ſay, that patience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth tryall, becauſe that whereas God hath promiſed helpe in trouble to ſuch as truſt in him, we find it by experience, in that wee continue ſtrong and ſtedfaſt all the while, and are vpholden by the hand of God, which thing we could not doe with all the powers that we haue of our owne. So then, by patience we find that our Lord giueth vs the helpe that hee hath promiſed vs at our need, whereby our hope is confirmed. And it were an ouer-great vnthankefulneſſe, not to truſt to ſuch an ayde and fauour for the time to come, as we haue found by experience to be ſo certaine and ſtedfaſt heretofore. But what need we ſo many words? It ought to ſuffice vs to know, that the true Chriſtians are through tribulation cloathed with the <note place="margin">Rom 8.</note> Image of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt crucified: which if we beare willingly and with a good heart, we ſhall in the end be cloathed with the Image of Ieſus Chriſt glorified. For as the paſſions of Ieſus Chriſt doe abound: ſo through him, ſhall the conſolations ouera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound: <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.</note> and if we ſuffer with him heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for a time, we ſhall alſo raigne with him there aboue for euer.</p>

feruent mind ſettled vpon God. By the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of Baptiſme, we ſhall aſſure our ſelues, that we are at peace with God. And <note place="margin">Baptiſme</note> foraſmuch as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that the Arke of <hi>Noe</hi> was a figure of Baptiſme: therefore <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> like as <hi>Noe</hi> was ſaued from the floud by the Arke, becauſe he beleeued the promiſes of God: ſo alſo are we by faith ſaued in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme from Gods Wrath. Which faith is grounded vpon the Word of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who ſaith that he which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth <note place="margin">Mark. 16.</note> and is baptized, ſhall bee ſaued. And good right it is: for in Baptiſme we put on Ieſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and conſequently we be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his righteouſneſſe, and of all his <note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> goods: and vnder this precious robe, the ſinnes that our frailty committeth, lye hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and couered, and are not imputed vnto vs. And ſo, according as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, the <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> bleſſedneſſe which the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh of appertaineth to vs: namely, Bleſſed are they whoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings are forgiuen, and whoſe ſinnes are couered. Bleſſed is the man to <note place="margin">Pſal. 36.</note> whom the Lord imputeth not ſinne. But it ſtandeth a Chriſtian in hand, to take good heed, that vpon theſe words he take no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſinne: for this doctrine belongeth to none ſuch as honour themſelues with the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7709:35"/>
name of Chriſtians, confeſſing Chriſt with their mouth, and yet deny him in their deeds. But it concerneth the true Chriſtians, who though they fight manfully againſt the fleſh, the world, and the diuell, doe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding fall daily, and are conſtrained to ſay, Lord, forgiue vs our offences. Theſe are they to whom we ſpeake, to comfort them and to hold them vp, that they fall not into deſpaire: as though the bloud of Chriſt waſhed vs not from all ſinne, and that hee were not our aduocate, and the atonement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker for his members. And therefore when we be prouoked to doubt of the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes, and that our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience beginneth to trouble vs: then muſt we furniſh our ſelues with true faith, and out of hand haue recourſe to the precious <note place="margin">The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord.</note> bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, ſhed for vs vpon the altar of the Croſſe, and diſtributed to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles at his laſt Supper, vnder the veile of a moſt holy Sacrament, which was ordained by Chriſt, to the end that we ſhould cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the remembrance of his death, and that by the ſame viſible Sacrament, our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conſciences might be aſſured of our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onement with God. The bleſſed Ieſus Chriſt made his laſt Will, when he ſaid, This is my body which is giuen for you: <note place="margin">Luke 22.</note>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:7709:36"/>
and, This is my blood of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Mar. 16.</note> which is ſhed for many to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of their ſinnes. We know that a <note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> Teſtament (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul)</hi> although it be but a mans Teſtament, yet neuertheleſſe if it be allowed, no man deſpiſeth it or addeth any thing to it: and that no Teſtament is of force till the Teſtator be dead, but hath full power after the parties deceaſe. Then did Ieſus Chriſt make his Teſtament, wherein he promiſeth forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and the grace and good fauour of himſelfe, and his Father, together with mercy and euerlaſting life. And to the intent that the ſaid Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be of full force, he hath confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it with his owne precious blood and with his owne death. By reaſon whereof, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that Ieſus Chriſt is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the New Teſtament, that by his <note place="margin">Heb 9.</note> dying for the redemption of thoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions which were in the former Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they that are called might receiue the promiſe of the eternall inheritance. For whereſoeuer is a Teſtament, there muſt alſo be the death of the Teſtator: for the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is confirmed by the death of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, inſomuch as it is of no value ſo long as the maker of it is aliue. Wherefore we be very certaine and aſſured by the death
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7709:36"/>
of Ieſus Chriſt, that his Teſtament is auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, whereby all our miſ-deeds are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and we made heires of eternall life. And for a token and faithfull pledge hereof, in <note place="margin">I renaeus. lib. 1.</note> ſtead of a Seale, he hath left vs this diuine Sacrament, which not onely giueth our ſoules aſſured hope of their euerlaſting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but alſo warranteth vnto vs that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of our fleſh, foraſmuch as it is euen now quickned by that immortall fleſh of his, and in a certaine manner becommeth partaker of the immortality thereof, and he that is partaker of that diuine fleſh by faith, ſhall not periſh for euer. But vnto him that <note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> receiueth it without the ſaid faith, it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to a dangerous poyſon, becauſe that like as when bodily ſuſtenance findeth the ſtomacke incumbred with euill humors, it corrupteth likewiſe and worketh great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance: euen ſo if this ſpirituall food light into a ſinfull ſoule that is full of malice and miſ-beliefe, it caſteth it headlong into ſome greater ruine, not through it owne default, but becauſe that to the vncleane and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer all things are vncleane: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the things bee ſanctified by the Lords bleſſing. For (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul)</hi> hee <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> that eateth of that bread, and drinketh of that cup vnworthily, is guilty of the body
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7709:37"/>
and bloud of the Lord, and he eateth and <note place="margin">What is meant by not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Lords Body.</note> drinketh his owne damnation, becauſe he maketh no difference of the Lords Body. For he maketh no difference of the Lords Body, which preſumeth to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per without faith and charity. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he beleeueth not that Body to be his life, and the cleanſer of all his ſinnes: he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Ieſus Chriſt a lyer, and treadeth the <note place="margin">He that receiueth this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth himſelfe to truſt in none other thing then the bloud of Chriſt.</note> Sonne of God vnder foot, and eſteemeth the bloud of the Teſtament whereby hee was ſanctified, but as a common or worldly thing, and doth great wrong to the Spirit of grace, and he ſhall be puniſhed very ſore at Gods hand, for this his vnbeliefe and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hypocriſie. For whereas he repoſeth not that truſt of his iuſtification in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: yet neuertheleſſe he receiueth this moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, and maketh proteſtation that he putteth not his truſt in any other thing. Whereby he accuſeth himſelfe, and is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his owne iniquity, and condemneth himſelfe to euerlaſting death, by refuſing the life which God promiſeth him in that holy Sacrament. And in this point, when the <note place="margin">Very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable counſell.</note> Chriſtian feeleth that his enemies are like to ouercome him: that is to wit, when he beginneth to doubt whether he haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7709:37"/>
forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes by Ieſus Chriſt: and that he ſhall not be able to withſtand the diuell and his temptations: and that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of his owne doubtfull conſcience comes to preſſe him, ſo as he beginneth to feare leſt hell fire ſhould ſwallow him vp, and death hold him in his euerlaſting bands by reaſon of Gods Wrath, I ſay, when the good Chriſtian feeleth himſelfe in ſuch ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: Let him get him to his holy Sacrament with a good heart and ſtout courage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it deuoutly, ſaying in his heart, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering his enemies thus: I confeſſe I haue deſerued a thouſand hels, and euerlaſting death, by reaſon of the great ſinnes which I haue committed. But this heauenly Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I receiue at that preſent, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me of the forgiueneſſe of all my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings, and of mine atonement with God. For if I haue an eye to my workes, there is no doubt but I acknowledge my ſelfe a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and condemne mine owne ſelfe in ſuch wiſe, as my conſcience ſhould neuer bee quiet, if I ſhould thinke that my ſinnes are pardoned me for my workes ſake. But when I looke to the promiſes and couenants of God, who promiſeth mee forgiueneſſe of my ſinnes by the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, I am as ſure that I haue obtained it, and that I
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7709:38"/>
haue his fauour, as I am ſure that hee which hath made the promiſes and couenants, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lye nor deceiue: and through this ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt faith I become righteous by Chriſts <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> righteouſneſſe, where through I am ſaued, and my conſcience quieted. Hath he not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his moſt innocent body into the hands of ſinners for our ſinnes? Hath hee not ſhed his blood to waſh away my iniquities? Why then doeſt thou vexe thy ſelfe, O my ſoule? put thy truſt in the Lord, who bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thee ſo great loue, that to deliuer thee from eternall death, it hath pleaſed him that his only Sonne ſhould ſuffer death and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who hath taken vpon himſelfe our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, to giue vs his riches: laid our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vpon himſelfe, to ſtabliſh vs in his ſtrength: become mortall, to make vs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall: come downe vnto the earth, to aduance vs vp to heauen: and become the Sonne of man with vs, to make vs the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God with himſelfe. Who is he then that ſhall accuſe vs? God is he that iuſtifieth <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> vs, and who ſhall condemne vs? Ieſus Chriſt is dead for vs, yea, and riſen againe for vs, and he ſitteth at the right hand of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Interceſſion for vs. Wherefore ſay with <hi>Dauid,</hi> Why art thou heauy, O my ſoule, and why doeſt thou trouble mee? doeſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7709:38"/>
thou ſee nothing but the Law, ſinne, wrath, heauineſſe, death, hell, and the diuell? Is there not now to be ſeene Grace, remiſſion of ſinnes, Righteouſneſſe, Conſolation, Ioy, Peace, Life, Heauen, Chriſt, and God?</p>
            <p>Trouble mee no more then, O my ſoule: for what is the Law? what is ſinne? what is death and the diuell, in compariſon of theſe things? Therefore truſt in God, who hath not ſpared his owne deare Sonne, but giuen him to the death of the croſſe for thy ſinnes, and hath giuen thee victory through him. This is the ſweet doctrine of the Goſpell, which I deſire, that all Chriſtians could receiue with Thankſgiuing and an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured faith: for then would Chriſt be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Ioy and ſweetneſſe to them; then would they take heart in the victory of Chriſts death, who indeed was made a curſe for vs, ſubiect to wrath, putting vpon him our perſon, and laid our ſinnes vpon his owne ſhoulders, and he hath made with vs this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py change, that is to ſay, hee tooke vpon him our ſinfull perſon, and gaue vnto vs his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and victorious perſon, wherewith wee being now cloathed, are free from the curſe of the Law.</p>
            <p>And therefore may euery poore ſinner ſay, with an aſſured confidence, Thou
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7709:39"/>
Chriſt, art my ſinne and my curſe; or rather, I am thy ſinne, and thy curſe, and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thou art my Righteouſneſſe, my Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and my Life, my Grace of God, and my Heauen. And thus, if wee by faith doe behold this brazen Serpent, Chriſt, hanging vpon the Croſſe, wee ſhall ſee the Law, ſinne, death, the diuell and hell, killed by his death: and ſo may with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſing that ioying heart Dittie: Thankes be to God, who hath giuen vs victory, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And ſo with theſe Thankeſgiuings, with theſe or ſuch other like thoughts muſt wee receiue the Sacrament of the body and blood of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. After this manner is all fearefulneſſe driuen out of the ſoule of the Chriſtian: and charitie is increaſed, faith ſtrengthened, the conſcience quieted, and the tongue neuer ceaſeth to praiſe God, and to yeeld him infinite thanks for ſo great a benefit. This is the vertue, efficacie, and only truſt of our ſoule. This is the Rocke whereupon if the conſcience bee builded, it feareth neither tempeſt, nor the gates of hell, nor Gods wrath, nor the Law, nor ſinne, nor death, nor the diuels, nor any other thing. And foraſmuch as the ſubſtance of the Lords Supper and Table conſiſteth in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7709:39"/>
this diuine Sacrament: When the Chriſtian is at it, he muſt hold his eyes faſtened conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vpon the paſſion of our gracious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, beholding him on the one ſide vpon the croſſe loden with all our ſinnes: and GOD on the other ſide puniſhing, chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and whipping his owne onely begotten and deare beloued Sonne in ſtead of vs. O happy is that man that ſhutteth his eyes from all other ſights, and will neither heare nor ſee any other thing then Ieſus Chriſt crucified, in whom are laid vp and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the treaſures of Gods wiſedome and diuine knowledge! Bleſſed (ſay I) is he that feedeth his minde with ſo heauenly a food, and maketh himſelfe drunken in the loue of God with ſo ſweet and ſingular a liquor. But before I make an end of this matter, I will firſt aduertiſe the Chriſtian, that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath ordinarily beene wont to terme this holy Sacrament the bond of charitie, and the myſtery of vnitie. And hee ſaith, that whoſoeuer receiueth the myſtery of vnitie, and regardeth not the bond of peace, receiueth not the Sacrament to his owne behoofe, but as a witneſſe againſt himſelfe. <note place="margin">Why the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</note> Therefore wee muſt vnderſtand, that the Lord hath ordained this holy Sacrament not only to make vs ſure of the forgiueneſſe of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7709:40"/>
our ſinnes: but alſo to inflame vs to peace, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and brotherly charitie. For in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the Lord doth after ſuch a manner make vs partakers of his body, as hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth all one thing with vs, and wee with him. By reaſon whereof, foraſmuch as hee <note place="margin">Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an peace and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the bread and wine.</note> hath but one body whereof hee maketh vs partakers: it is meet that we alſo ſhould by ſuch partaking become all one body toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among our ſelues. And this vnion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the bread of the Sacrament: which as it is made of many graines min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and kneaded together, in ſuch wiſe as one of them cannot bee diſcerned from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So alſo muſt we bee ioyned together af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a ſort, and ſo vnited together into one agreement of minde, as no diuiſion may creepe in. And this doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhew vs, when he ſaith: Is not the cup of bleſſing which wee bleſſe, the communion of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt? is not the bread that wee breake, the communion of the body of Ieſus Chriſt? whereas we be many, yet are <note place="margin">He that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth one of his Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth Chriſt himſelfe.</note> wee but one bread and one body, forſomuch as we be all partakers of one bread. By theſe things we vnderſtand, that when we receiue his moſt holy communion, wee muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that wee are all of vs ingrafted into Chriſt, and are all become members of one
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7709:40"/>
ſelfe-ſame body, that is to wit, of Ieſus Chriſt, in ſuch wiſe as we cannot offend, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame, or deſpiſe any of our brethren, but we muſt therewithall offend defame, and deſpiſe our ſaid head Ieſus Chriſt: neither can we be at variance with any of our brethren, but in like wiſe we muſt be at oddes with him. Alſo we cannot loue him, except wee loue him in our brethren. Looke how much care we haue of our owne body, ſo much muſt we haue of our Chriſtian brethren, who are the members of our body. And like as no part of our body feeleth any griefe, which ſpreadeth not it ſelfe into all the other parts: ſo ought wee to determine with our ſelues, that our brother feeleth not any inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which ſhould not mooue vs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. With ſuch manner of thoughts muſt we prepare our ſelues to this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, quickning vp our ſpirits with a feruent loue to our neighbourward. For what greater ſpurre can we haue to pricke <note place="margin">A prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> vs to loue one another, then to ſee that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by giuing himſelfe vnto vs, not only allureth vs to giue our ſelues one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but alſo by making himſelfe common to vs all, maketh vs alſo to be all one ſelfe-ſame thing in him? In reſpect whereof, we ought to couet and procure, that in all of vs
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7709:41"/>
there may be but one minde, one heart, and one tongue, accorded and vnited together in thoughts, words and deeds. And wee muſt marke well, that as oft as wee receiue this <note place="margin">He that receiueth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, bindeth himſelfe to all the duties of charitie.</note> holy and worthy Sacrament, wee bind our ſelues to all the duties of charitie: as not to offend any of our brethren, nor to leaue any thing vndone, that may bee profitable and helpefull in their neceſſitie. But if there come any to this heauenly Table of the Lord, that are diuided at variance with their brethren, the ſame muſt aſſure themſelues that they eate vnworthily, and are guiltie of the body and blood of the Lord, and that they eate and drinke their owne damnation: for that there wanted nothing on their behalfe, but that the body of Ieſus Chriſt was rent and plucked in pieces againe, whileſt they by hatred are diuided from their brethren, that is to wit, from the members of Ieſus Chriſt, and haue not any part with him, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe in receiuing this holy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pretended to beleeue that their whole ſaluation conſiſteth in the participation and vnion with Ieſus Chriſt. Then let vs goe, my <note place="margin">The true end for which the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> brethren, to the receiuing of this heauenly bread, to celebrate the remembrance of our Lords paſſion, and to ſtrengthen and fortifie the beliefe and aſſurance of the forgiueneſſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7709:41"/>
of our ſinnes, with the remembrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to quicken vp our minds and tongues to praiſe and exalt the infinite goodneſſe of our God, and finally to cherriſh brotherly loue, and to witneſſe the ſame one to another by the ſtraight vnion which all of vs haue in the body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <note place="margin">The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. remedy againſt diſtruſt.</note> prayer, and the remembring of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and the often reſorting to the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communion, there is one other very good remedy againſt diſtruſt and fearefulneſſe, which is no leſſe friend to Chriſtian chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: namely, the remembrance of our prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination and election to eternall life, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the Word of God, which is the Sword of the H. Ghoſt, wherewith we may beat backe our enemies. Reioyce ye in this <note place="margin">Eph. 5. Luke 10.</note> (ſaith the Lord) that your names are written in heauen. There is no greater ioy in this life, nor any thing that more comforteth the Chriſtian that is afflicted, tempted, or falne into any ſinne, then the remembrance of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, and the aſſuring of our ſelues that we be of the number of them whoſe names are written in the Booke of life, and which are choſen to be faſhioned like vnto the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Ieſus Chriſt. O how vnſpeakeable is the comfort of him that hath this faith, and muſeth continually in his heart vpon
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7709:42"/>
this exceeding ſweet predeſtination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he knoweth that although he fall often, yet notwithſtanding, God his Father who <note place="margin">Pſal. 36.</note> hath fore-ordained him to euerlaſting life, holdeth him vp, and reacheth out his hand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him continually. And he ſaith continually in himſelfe, If God haue choſen me, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated me to the glory of his children, who can hinder me? If God bee with vs (ſaith S. <hi>Paul)</hi> who can be againſt vs? Nay <note place="margin">Rom. 8. He that receiueth the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, is ſure that he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> rather, to the end that the Predeſtination may be accompliſhed in vs, he hath ſent his deare-beloued Sonne, who is a moſt ſure ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt penny and pledge vnto vs, that we which haue receiued the Grace of the Goſpell, are Gods Children, choſen to eternall life. This holy Predeſtination maintaineth the true Chriſtian in a continuall ſpirituall ioy, <note place="margin">The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> increaſeth in him the indeauour of good workes, and inflameth him with the loue of God, and maketh him enemy to the world and to ſinne. Who is ſo fierce and hard-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which knowing that God of his mercy hath made him his child from euerlaſting, will not by and by be inflamed to loue God? Who is of ſo vile and baſe courage, that hee will not eſteeme all the pleaſures, all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and all the riches of the world as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy mire, when he knowes that God hath
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7709:42"/>
made him a Citizen of heauen? yea theſe are they that worſhip God rightly in ſpirit and truth, receiuing all things (as well in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity as in aduerſity) at the hand of God their Father, and euermore praiſing and than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him for all, as their good Father, who is righteous and holy in all his workes. Theſe being inflamed with the Loue of God, and armed with the knowledge of their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, feare neither death, nor ſin, nor the diuell, nor hell: neither know they what the wrath of God is: for they ſee none other thing in God, but loue and fatherly kindneſſe towards them. And if they fall into any troubles, they accept them as tokens of Gods fauour, crying out with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Who <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> is it that ſhall ſeparate vs from Gods loue? ſhall tribulations, ſhall anguiſh, ſhall perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or hunger, or nakedneſſe, or perill, or ſword? as it is written, For thy ſake are we killed all the day long, and counted as ſheepe appointed to the ſlaughter. But in all theſe things we get the vpper hand through him that hath loued vs. Wherefore, it is not for nought, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, how the true <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3.</note> Chriſtians know right well, that they muſt be ſaued and glorified, and that by reaſon of the ſame affiance, they make themſelues ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Ieſus Chriſt is holy. And when Saint
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7709:43"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth his Diſciples to a good <note place="margin">Eph. 1.</note> and holy life: he is wont to put them in remembrance of their election and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as of a thing of very great force to ſtirre vp the minds of the true Chriſtians to the louing of God, and to the performance of good workes. And for the ſame cauſe our good Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſpeaketh open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this holy predeſtination, as one that knew of how great importance the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof is to the edifying of his elect. But perchance thou wilt ſay to me, I know well that they whoſe names are written in heauen, haue cauſe to liue in continuall ioy, and glorifie God both in word and deed; but I know not whether I am of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or no, and therefore I liue in continuall feare; ſpecially becauſe I know my ſelfe to be an exceeding weake and fraile ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, from the violence whereof I am not able to defend my ſelfe, but that I am ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of it daily. And furthermore, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I ſee my ſelfe continually afflicted and troubled with diuers temptations, mee thinkes, I doe as it were behold with mine eyes, the wrath of God ſcourging me. To anſwer to theſe doubts of thine, I ſay, my right deare brother, that thou muſt aſſure thy ſelfe, that all theſe are but temptations of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7709:43"/>
the diuell, who by all meanes ſeeketh to rob vs of that faith and confidence that ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of faith, and aſſureth vs of Gods good will towards vs. He laboureth to ſtrip our ſoules out of this precious garment: for he knoweth that none is a true Chriſtian, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he beleeue Gods Word, which promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth forgiueneſſe of all ſinnes, and peace to all them, which accept the grace of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Verily I ſay, that he which vpon theſe promiſes of God, perſwadeth not himſelfe aſſuredly, that God is a mercifull and louing Father vnto him, nor with ſtedfaſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence looketh to receiue the inheritance of the heauenly Kingdome at his hand: is not faithfull in deed, and maketh himſelfe vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnworthy of Gods Grace. In reſpect whereof, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that we be the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Heb. 3.</note> of God, ſo far forth as we firmely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the confidence and glory of our hope, vnto the end. And in another place he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that we ſhould not giue ouer our truſt, <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> which hath great reward of recompence. And therefore, my brethren, let vs giue our whole endeauour to do the Will of God, as it becommeth good children, and beware that we ſin not, as neere as we can. And although we fall oftentimes into ſin through our owne frailty: yet let vs not by and by ſurmize,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7709:44"/>
that we bee veſſels of wrath, or that we be vtterly forſaken of the holy Ghoſt: for we haue our Aduocate Ieſus Chriſt before Gud the Father, and he is the atonement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker for our ſinnes. Let vs bethinke vs of the opinion of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who ſaith that none of the Saints is righteous and without ſinne: and yet notwithſtanding that, he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not to be righteous and holy, ſo farre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth as he retaines his holineſſe with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And therefore if we haue afflictions <note place="margin">Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are no ſignes of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</note> and tribulations, let vs not thinke that God ſends them becauſe he is our enemy, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is our moſt louing Father. The Lord (ſaith <hi>Salomon)</hi> chaſtiſeth him whom he loueth, and ſcourgeth euery child of his whom he receiueth. Wherefore if we haue <note place="margin">Prou. 5.</note> receiued the Grace of the Goſpell, whereby man is receiued of God for his Child, we muſt not doubt of Gods grace and good will towards vs. And when wee perceiue our ſelues to delight in Gods Word, and to haue a deſire to follow the life of Ieſus <note place="margin">A true marke to know Gods children by.</note> Chriſt: we muſt ſtedfaſtly beleeue, that we be the children of God, and the Temple of the holy Ghoſt: for thoſe things cannot be done by the power of mans wiſedome, but are the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, who dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs by faith, and is as it were a ſeale
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7709:44"/>
of authority, which ſealeth vp Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in our hearts, the certainety whereof is printed aforehand in our minds, and is giuen vs as a pledge to ſtabliſh and confirme the ſame. As ſoone as you beleeue (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle S. <hi>Paul)</hi> ye be ſealed by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <note place="margin">Eph. 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle calleth the holy Ghoſt the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</note> of promiſe, who is the earneſt peny of our inheritance. Behold how he ſheweth vs hereby, that the hearts of the faithfull are marked with the holy Ghoſt, as it were with a ſeale: in reſpect whereof, he calleth the holy Ghoſt, The Spirit of promiſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as he confirmeth the promiſe of the Goſpell, the which (as I haue oftentimes told you) is a happy tydings that promiſeth forgiueneſſe of ſinnes and euerlaſting life, to all ſuch as beleeue that all their miſdoings are blotted out in Ieſus Chriſt. All we that beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul)</hi> are <note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> become the children of God: and becauſe we be his children, he hath ſent the Spirit of his Sonne into our heart, which cryeth, Father, Father. And to the Romanes, Thoſe (ſaith hee) that are guided by the Spirit of God, are the children of God: for yee haue <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> not receiued againe the ſpirit of bondage in feare: but the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Father, Father. For certainely the ſame Spirit beareth our ſpirit record, that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7709:45"/>
we be the children of God. Now then, if we be children, we be alſo heires. And we muſt marke well, that in theſe two places, the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh plainely, not of any ſpeciall reuelation, but of a certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord which the holy Ghoſt doth commonly yeeld to all ſuch as receiue the grace of the Goſpell. Then if the holy Ghoſt aſſure vs that we be Gods children and heires: why ſhould we doubt of our predeſtination? The ſame man ſaith in the ſame Epiſtle, Whom <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> he hath predeſtinated, them hath he alſo called: and whom he hath called, them hath he alſo made righteous: and whom he hath made righteous, them alſo hath he glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What ſhall we then ſay to all theſe <note place="margin">A true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> things? If God be on our ſide, who can be againſt vs? And therefore if I plainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that God hath called me by giuing me faith and the fruits of faith, that is to wit, Peace of conſcience, mortification of the fleſh, and quickning of the ſpirit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in whole or in part, why ſhould I doubt that I am not predeſtinated? And moreouer we ſay with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that all true Chriſtians (that is to wit, all ſuch as beleeue <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.</note> the Goſpell) receiue not the ſpirit of this world, but the Spirit that commeth from God: by the inſpiration whereof they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7709:45"/>
the things that God hath giuen them. What maruell then is it, if wee know that God hath certainly giuen vs euerlaſting life? But there are ſome which ſay, that no man ought to preſume ſo farre, as to boaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to haue the Spirit of God. They ſpeake in ſuch wiſe, as if the Chriſtian ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the hauing of it for his owne deſerts, and not by the onely and meere mercy of God: and as though it were a preſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to profeſſe himſelfe a Chriſtian: or as though a man could bee a Chriſtian without the hauing of Chriſts Spirit: or as though we could without flat hypocriſie ſay that Ieſus Chriſt is our Lord, or call God our Father, if the holy Ghoſt mooued not our hearts and <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1. Cor. 12.</note> tongues to vtter ſo ſweet words. And yet notwithſtanding, euen they that count vs preſumptuous for ſaying that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs his holy Spirit, with faith, forbid vs not to ſay euery day <hi>Our Father,</hi> but rather command vs. But I would haue them to tell mee, how it is poſſible to ſeparate faith and <note place="margin">He that gloryeth not that hee hath the holy Ghoſt, is no true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> the holy Ghoſt aſunder, ſeeing that faith is the peculiar worke of the holy Ghoſt? If it be preſumption to beleeue that the holy Ghoſt is in vs, why doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bid the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> try themſelues whether they haue faith or no, affirming them to bee reprobates,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7709:46"/>
if they know not that Ieſus Chriſt is in them? But in very deed, it is a great blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to accuſe the Chriſtians of preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe for taking vpon them to glory of the preſence of the holy Ghoſt, without which glorying, there cannot bee any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity at all. But Ieſus Chriſt (who cannot lye) ſaith, that his Spirit is vnknowne to the world, and that they onely doe know <note place="margin">Iohn 14.</note> him, within whom hee dwelleth. Then let them begin to become good Chriſtians, and put away their Iewiſh minds, and imbrace the grace of the holy Goſpell in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt: and then ſhall they know that the good and true Chriſtians both haue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and alſo acknowledge themſelues to haue him. But ſome may ſay to mee, That the Chriſtian cannot by any meanes know that he is in Gods fauour, without ſome ſpeciall reuelation: and ſo conſequently, that he cannot know whether he be predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or no. And hee may ſpecially alleadge theſe words of <hi>Salomon:</hi> A man knoweth <note place="margin">Eccleſs. 6.</note> not whether he be worthy of hatred or of loue: and alſo theſe words of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> I feele not my ſelfe <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> guilty of any thing, and yet feele I not my ſelfe iuſtified for all that. It ſeemeth to bee <note place="margin">A man may know that he is in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</note> ſufficiently declared by the texts of holy
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7709:46"/>
Scripture, that the ſaid opinion is falſe: and now remaineth onely to be ſhewed briefely, that theſe two texts whereupon the ſame opinion is chiefely grounded, ought not to bee taken in that ſenſe. As touching <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> ſentence, although it bee ſcarſe well and faithfully tranſlated in the common tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet is there not any man ſo dull, who in reading <hi>Salomons</hi> whole diſcourſe, may not plainely perceiue, that by ſaying ſo, hee <note place="margin">By the chances of this life, no man can iudge whether a man bee in Gods fauour or diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> meant, that if any man will take vpon him to iudge by the caſualties that happen in this life, who is loued or hated of God: hee laboureth in vaine, conſidering that the ſelfe-ſame chances which light vpon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, light alſo vpon the vnrighteous: vpon him that ſacrificeth, as well as vpon him that ſacrificeth not: and as ſoone vpon the good man, as vpon the ſinner. Whereof it may bee gathered, that God doth not alwayes ſhew his loue towards thoſe whom hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth with outward proſperities: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, that hee ſheweth not his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure towards thoſe whom hee puniſheth. Then, my right deare brethren in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lord, doe you thinke it reaſon to conclude, that a man cannot be ſure of Gods fauour, becauſe the ſame ſureneſſe cannot bee perceiued by the ſundry chances, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7709:47"/>
euery day in theſe tranſitory and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things? A little afore, <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, That a man cannot diſcerne any difference betweene the ſoule of man, and the life of a beaſt: for it is ſeene that both man and beaſt dye after one manner. Shall we then conclude by this outward accident, that the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which wee haue conceiued of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie of the ſoule, is grounded but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon coniecture? No ſurely: and it were a great folly to ſtand vpon a thing ſo notably knowne. And as for S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, I ſay, that foraſmuch as hee was ſpeaking of the adminiſtration of the Goſpell, hee meant that his heart miſ-giues him not of any miſ-dealing therein, and yet for all that, that hee is not ſure hee hath done his whole duty to the full, and therein obtained the praiſe of righteouſneſſe to Godward, as if hee had done all that pertained and was conuenient to be done by a faithfull Steward: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſpeaking of his office, like a iuſt and diſcreet perſon, hee durſt not iuſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, nor auow that hee had diſcharged his duty to the vttermoſt, and ſatisfied his Lords will, but referred all things to the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iudgement of his Lord. And verily, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer readeth theſe words of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and conſidereth the words going
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7709:47"/>
afore them with ſome iudgement, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the words that follow, will not doubt, but this is the true ſenſe of them. I know well, that ſome men in expounding theſe words of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſay, that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he knew himſelfe to bee without ſinne, yet he knew not whether hee were righteous to Godward or no, according as <hi>Dauid</hi> affirmeth, that no man can perfectly know his owne ſinnes. But theſe men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not that S. <hi>Paul</hi> groundeth not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 5.</note> vpon workes, but vpon faith, and that he vtterly refuſeth his owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to imbrace onely the righteouſneſſe which God hath giuen vs, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Alſo they conſider not, <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> that he was moſt certaine to be accepted for righteous, in maintaining the ſoundneſſe and pureneſſe of the Chriſtian faith, and that he knew well how the Crowne of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe was laid vp for him in Heauen: and alſo, that he was fully aſſured, that no <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.</note> creature in heauen, earth, nor hell, was able to ſeparate him from the Loue of God, and that he longed to dye, becauſe he knew for a truth, that after his death, he ſhould be <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> with Ieſus Chriſt. All which things ſhould <note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> be falſe, if he had not beene well aſſured that he was righteous, (I meane) by faith,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7709:48"/>
and not by workes. Therefore, my deare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued brethren, let vs ceaſe to ſpeake that thing of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer once thought of himſelfe, but fiercely fought againſt it continually, in anſwering ſuch as meaſured righteouſneſſe by workes, and not by faith in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. But beſides theſe two authorities of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> a man might alledge ſome other places of holy Scripture, which whereas they warne and encourage men to feare God, ſeeme to be contrary to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of this our predeſtination. And if I would declare them all particularly, I ſhould be ouer-long. But I ſay generally, that the feare of puniſhment was proper to the Old Teſtament, and childly loue to the New Teſtament: according as S. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, <note place="margin">The two ſorts of feare, childly &amp; ſlauiſh.</note> when he ſaith to the Romanes, Ye haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage to feare: but yee haue receiued the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Father, Father. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vnto <hi>Timothy</hi> he ſaith, that God hath not giuen vs the ſpirit of fearefulneſſe, but <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.</note> rather of power and loue: which ſpirit Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath giuen vs according to the promiſe made by the mouth of the holy Prophets, and brought to paſſe, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered out of our enemies hands, may
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7709:48"/>
ſerue him without feare before his holy preſence, in all holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of our life. By theſe and many other places of the holy Scripture, a man may plainely gather, that the painefull and ſlauiſh fearefulneſſe agreeth not with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: and this is already confirmed by this, that ſuch manner of fearefulneſſe is vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the ſpirituall cheerefulneſſe and ioy, which is peculiar to the Chriſtian, as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth openly to the Romanes, ſaying that the Kingdome of God is righteouſneſſe, and peace, and ioy in <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> the holy Ghoſt: that is to ſay, that euery man which entereth into the Kingdome of the grace of the Goſpell, is become righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous through faith: and afterward addeth peace of conſcience, which conſequently breedeth ſuch a ſpirituall and holy reſt and gladneſſe, in reſpect whereof, the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth oftentimes incourage the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <note place="margin">Eph. 6. Phil. 4.</note> to liue merrily. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that all they which beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, doe <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> continually reioyce with an vnſpeakeable and glorious ioy, notwithſtanding that they be afflicted with diuers temptations. And <note place="margin">The ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh feare threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the wicked, and the childly feare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the choſen.</note> therefore when the holy Scripture threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and frayeth the Chriſtians, they muſt vnderſtand, that it ſpeaketh to ſuch as are
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7709:49"/>
ſo licentious, that forſomuch as they keepe not the thankefulneſſe and honeſty that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Gods children, they muſt bee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as ſeruants, and held in awe, vntill they come to taſte and feele how ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant the Lord is, and vntill ſuch time as faith worke his effects in them, and that they haue ſo much childly loue, as may ſuffice to keepe and maintaine them in honeſty of Chriſtian conuerſation, and in following the example of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And when the ſelfe-ſame Scripture exhorteth Chriſtians to the true feare: it meaneth not that they ſhould feare the iudgement and wrath of God, as though it were preſently ready to condemne them: for (as I haue ſaid already) by the record which the holy Ghoſt giueth to their ſpirit, they know that God hath choſen them and called them, of his owne meere mercy, and not for their deſerts. By reaſon whereof, they doubt not at all, but that by the ſelf-ſame goodneſſe and mercy, he will maintaine them in the happy ſtate wherein he hath placed them. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch manner the Scripture exhorteth <note place="margin">The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of childly feare, Eph. 4.</note> them, not to ſlauiſh feare, but to childiſh feare, that is to wit, that like good children they ſhould bee loth to offend againſt the Chriſtian Religion, or to commit any thing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7709:49"/>
againſt the dutie and honeſty of Gods true children, and likewiſe to grieue the holy Ghoſt that dwelleth in them: to the end that knowing the corruptedneſſe of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we ſhould alwayes be heedfull and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and neuer haue any truſt in our ſelues: for in our fleſh and in our minds doe the appetites and affections continually dwell: which, as deadly enemies of the ſoule, lay a thouſand ſnares and baites for vs, inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labouring to make vs proud, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, lecherous, and couetous. This is the feare whereunto the whole Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth the Chriſtians that haue once taſted how ſweet the Lord is, and which beſtow all their endeauour in following Chriſts foot-ſteps, who caſt not from them this holy feare, becauſe they labour to put off the old man.</p>
            <p>And the good Chriſtians muſt neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue themſelues quite and cleane of this childly feare, which is the ſingular friend of Chriſtian charitie, like as the ſlauiſh feare is ſuch an enemy vnto it, as they can by no <note place="margin">The Chriſtian may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſins.</note> meanes dwell together. And by the foreſaid things, a man may plainly perceiue, that the good Chriſtian ought neuer to doubt of the forgiueneſſe of his ſins, nor of Gods fauour. Neuertheleſſe, for the better ſatisfying of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7709:50"/>
the Reader, I purpoſe to ſet downe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnder, certaine authorities of the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, which confirme this foreſaid truth. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hilary</hi> in his fifth Canon vpon <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſaith, It is Gods will, that we ſhould hope without any doubting of his vnknowne will. For if the beleefe be doubtfull, there can be no righteouſneſſe obtained by beleeuing. And thus we ſee, that according to S. <hi>Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> a man obtaineth not forgiueneſſe of his <note place="margin">S. <hi>Hilary.</hi>
               </note> ſinnes at Gods hand, except he beleeue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to obtaine it. And good right it is that it ſhould be ſo. For he that doubteth, <note place="margin">Iames 1.</note> is like a waue of the Sea, which is toſſed and turmoyled with the wind. And therefore let not ſuch a one thinke to obtaine any thing at Gods hand. But let vs heare S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">S. <hi>August.</hi>
               </note> who in his <hi>Manuell</hi> counſelleth vs to driue away the ſaid fooliſh imagination, which intendeth to diſpoſſeſſe vs of the foreſaid good and ſage aſſuredneſſe. Let ſuch fooliſh imagination (ſaith he) murmure as much as it liſteth, ſaying, Who are thou? how great is that glory? by what deſerts hopeſt thou to obtaine it? I anſwer aſſuredly: I know in whom I haue beleeued, and I know that hee (of his great loue) hath made me his ſonne: I know he is true of his promiſe, and able to performe his word: for he can doe what
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7709:50"/>
he will. And when I thinke vpon the Lords death, the multitude of my ſinnes cannot diſmay me, for in his death doe I put all my truſt. His death is my whole deſert, it is my refuge, it is my ſaluation, my life and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the mercy of the Lord is my deſert. I am not poore of deſert, ſo long as the Lord of mercy faileth me not. And ſith the mercies of the Lord are many, many alſo are my deſeruings. The more that he is of power to ſaue, the more am I ſure to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The ſame S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> talking with God in another place, ſaith that he had deſpaired by reaſon of his great ſinnes and infinite negligences, if the Word of God had not become fleſh. And anon after, he ſaith theſe words: All my hope, all the aſſurance of my truſt is ſettled in his precious bloud, which was ſhed for vs and for our ſaluation. In him my poore heart taketh breath: and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my whole truſt in him, I long to come vnto thee, O Father, not hauing mine owne righteouſneſſe, but that righteouſneſſe of thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. In theſe two places S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſheweth plainely, that the Chriſtian muſt not be afraid, but aſſure himſelfe of righteouſneſſe, by grounding himſelfe, not vpon his owne workes, but vpon the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7709:51"/>
bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, which cleanſeth vs from all our ſinnes, and maketh our peace with God. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in his firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi>
               </note> vpon the Annunciation ſaith moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that it is not ynough to beleeue that a man can haue forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes, but by Gods mercy: nor any one good deſire or ability to doe ſo much as one good worke, except God giue it him: no nor that a man cannot deſerue eternall life by his workes, but if God giue him the gift ſo to beleeue. But beſides all theſe things (ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard)</hi> (which ought rather to be counted a certaine entrance and foundation of our faith) it is needfull that <note place="margin">Each one muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that his ſinnes are releaſed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen him free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> thou beleeue alſo, that thy ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee for the Loue of Ieſus Chriſt. See how this holy man confeſſeth, that it is not ynough to beleeue generally the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes: but he muſt alſo beleeue particularly that his owne ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him by Ieſus Chriſt; and the reaſon is ready at hand, namely, that foraſmuch as God hath promiſed thee to accept thee for righteous through the merits of Ieſus Chriſt, if thou beleeue not that thou art become righteous through him, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt God a lyer, and conſequently thou
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7709:51"/>
makeſt thy ſelfe vnworthy of his grace and liberality. But thou wilt ſay to me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue well the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and I know that God is true: but I am afraid that I am not worthy to haue ſo great a gift. I anſwer, that the forgiueneſſe of thy ſinnes ſhall not be a gift or free grace, but a wages, if God ſhould giue it thee for the worthyneſſe of thy workes. But I reply vpon thee, that God accepteth thee for righteous, and layeth not thy ſinne to thy charge, becauſe of Chriſts merits, which are giuen vnto thee, and become thine by faith. Therefore, following the counſell of Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> Beleeue thou not onely the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes in generall, but alſo apply the ſame beliefe to thine owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, by beleeuing without any doubt, that all thy miſ-doings are pardoned thee through Ieſus Chriſt. And in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou ſhalt giue the glory vnto God, by confeſſing him to be mercifull and true, and ſhalt become righteous and holy before God, forſomuch as by the ſame confeſſion, the holineſſe and righteouſneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, ſhall be communicated vnto thee. But to returne to our purpoſe of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: I ſay, that by the things aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, a man may euidently perceiue, that the <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                  <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>

               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:7709:52"/>
how it happeneth, that when they bee diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they ſay not alſo, I will haue neither Phyſician nor phyſicke: for looke what God had determined vpon mee, cannot but come to paſſe? why eate they? why drinke they? why till they the ground? why plant they Vines? and why be they ſo diligent in doing all things conuenient for to ſuſtaine the body? why ſay they not alſo, that all theſe turmoilings, policies, and trauels of ours are ſuperfluous, foraſmuch as it is not poſſible, but that whatſoeuer God hath fore-ſeene and determined concerning our life and death, muſt needs come to paſſe? And therefore if Gods prouidence make them not negligent and idle in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the body: why ſhould it make them more ſlouthfull and negligent in that which concerneth the Chriſtian perfection, which without all compariſon is farre no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler then the body? But foraſmuch as we ſee that neither Ieſus Chriſt, nor Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> for any doubt of offending the reprobates, haue forborne to preach the truth, which is neceſſary to the edifying of the choſen, for the loue of whom the euerlaſting Sonne of God became man, and was put to death vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe: wee alſo in like wiſe ought
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7709:52"/>
not to forbeare the preaching of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the true Chriſtians, foraſmuch as we haue ſeene, that it importeth great edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Now are wee come to the end of our purpoſe, wherein our chiefe intent hath beene (according to our ſmall power) to magnifie the wonderfull benefit which the Chriſtian man hath receiued by Ieſus Chriſt crucified, and to ſhew that faith of her ſelfe alone iuſtifyeth, that is to wit, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth and holdeth them for righteous, which beleeue ſtedfaſtly, that Chriſt hath made full amends for their ſinnes: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, that as light can not be ſeparated from fire, which of it ſelfe burneth and deuoureth all things: euen ſo good workes can not be ſeparated from faith, which alone by it ſelfe iuſtifieth.</p>
            <p>And this holy doctrine (which exalteth Ieſus Chriſt, and repreſſeth and abateth the pride of man) hath and alwayes ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, and fought againſt, by ſuch Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as haue Iewiſh mindes. But happy is hee, who following the example of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpoyleth himſelfe of his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and would haue none other righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, then that which is of Ieſus
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7709:53"/>
Chriſt, wherewith if he be cloathed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled, hee may moſt aſſuredly appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and ſhall receiue his bleſſing and the heritage of heauen and earth, with his only Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: to whom be all honour, praiſe and glory, from this time forth for euermore.</p>
