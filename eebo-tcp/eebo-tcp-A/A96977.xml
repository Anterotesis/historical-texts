         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Collection of ſeveral Paſſages concerning
His late Highneſs Oliver Cromwell, in the time
of his Sickneſs, wherein is related many of
his Expreſſions upon his Death-bed.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Is Highneſs being at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi>
ſickned a little before the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
died, whoſe deceaſe was on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
the ſixth day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1658.
ſhee having lain long under great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of bodily pain, which with frequent and
violent Convulſion-fits brought her to her end.</p>
            <p>But as to His Highneſs, it was obſerved, that
the ſenſe of her outward miſery in the pains ſhee
endured, took deep impreſſion upon him, who
indeed ever was a moſt indulgent and tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
his affections being regulated and bounded
with ſuch Chriſtian wiſdome and prudence, which
did eminently ſhine forth in filling up, not onely
that of a Father, but alſo all other Relations,
wherein hee was a moſt rare and ſingular example.</p>
            <p>And no doubt but the ſympathy of his ſpirit
with his ſorely afflicted and dying Daughter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
alſo his great burdens, cares, and labours
in Government; Hard cenſures, bitter reproaches,
and unjuſt calumnies from friends; the plots, conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies,
and ingratitude of enemies, of all whom hee
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119188:3"/>
better deſerved; Beſides his deep ſenſe of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſtians in other parts of the world, as far as
the Proteſtant Intereſt extended; I ſay, conſidering
all this, and much more, which ſuch a large heart
and comprehenſive ſpirit as hee had, could and did
take in, It was enough to have depreſt and ſunk
the ſtouteſt and moſt undaunted courage in the
world; And I have often wondred hee was able to
hold out ſo long, But that hee was born up by a
ſupernatural power, at a more than ordinary rate,
whereby (doubtleſs) hee had held out longer as
a mercy to the truly Chriſtian <hi>World,</hi> And to us
in theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> had wee been worthy of him,
and not <hi>ſind</hi> him away; Upon which account the
Nation, eſpecially the godly, and his own Family,
and perſonal Relations, have great cauſe of ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
and humbling before the <hi>Lord,</hi> in order to
a <hi>Timely Return,</hi> leſt a worſe thing befall us, and
the effect and conſequence of this great blow of
Gods hand, prove worſe than what wee (at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)
feel or fear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> I ſay, his time was come, and neither
prayers nor tears could prevail with God to
lengthen out his life, and lend him longer to us,
although abundantly and unceſſantly poured out
on his behalf, both publickly and privately (as was
obſerved) in a more than ordinary way. Beſides
many a ſecret ſigh, yet like <hi>Moſes</hi> Cry, more loud,
and ſtrongly laying hold on God, though neither
perceived not heard by man, than many vocal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.
All which (the hearts of Gods people
being thus mightily ſtirred up) did ſeem to beget
confidence in ſome, and hopes in all, yea ſome
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119188:3"/>
thoughts in himſelf that God would reſtore him.</p>
            <p>And yet wee could not bee more deſirous hee
ſhould abide, than hee was content and willing to
bee gone, as hee expreſt near his end, knowing that
there were better Manſions, a better Kingdome and
Inheritance, a better Crown, and a better Throne,
yea every way better things in Heaven provided
for him, as might bee gathered from his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
yea the whole courſe of his life, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
converſation, and cloſe communion with
God, ever ſince his effectual calling and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with Jeſus Chriſt, obſerved many years by
ſuch as knew him, and in the Lord had intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with him, ſome whereof are living wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
to this day.</p>
            <p>But truly, ſince God raiſed him to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the truth hereof hath ſo abundantly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the mouth of envy its ſelf muſt needs bee
ſtopped. And which things (although hee be dead)
yet ſpeak in the hearts of ſome, his neareſt and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt
obſervers, and may ſpeak to the conviction
of moſt profeſſors of godlineſs, and bee an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
pattern to them, eſpecially ſuch in great place
and power, as beſt acquainted with his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which through grace hee was enabled to
bear and overcome in a great meaſure.</p>
            <p>And truly wee may ſay, that the one half of his
worth, as a great Chriſtian and ſervant of God,
was not known to others, and therefore little
comparatively can bee ſaid; yet that little may be
of much ſpiritual advantage to bee remembred,
and as a copy to be writ after, ſeeing the original
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119188:4"/>
is taken from us, and now in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Therefore in order thereunto I ſhall onely ſet
down a few Obſervations occaſionally made of
what paſt from himſelf at times, before, and in his
ſickneſs; the whole (as I ſaid) being but one letter of
his name, as an excellent Chriſtian, or a few frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of what may bee ſaid by others, and I hope
will, for publick uſe, this being onely a private
Remembrance.</p>
            <p>And firſt his great Knowledge in the Myſteries
of godlineſs, the depth, ſoundneſs, and ſolidity of
his judgement being ſuch, that hee was enabled to
diſcuſs the greateſt truths of God, with ſo much
clearneſſe and evidence, that few of any ſort of men
could match him, to the great advantage of ſuch as
were ſo happy (as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaid to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>)
to ſtand before him; his ſpeech alwaies mixt
with that humility and zeal, and ſo peircing, that
it could not but leave ſome impreſſion upon thoſe
that heard him; And hath been to ſome of more
than ordinary uſe to edification.</p>
            <p>And indeed, the excellency of his ſpirit lay prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
in the wonderful inſight hee had attained
unto, and clearneſs in the Covenant of Grace,
which doubtleſs, as it was his greateſt ſtudy, as that
wherein his All, and the All of every Chriſtian
doth lye, ſo it was his greateſt delight to bee often
ſpeaking thereof, that hearing him, ſometimes, I
have thought with my ſelf, if theſe things bee ſo,
that grace is ſo full, ſo free to ſinners, to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſinners, what reaſon or room could there bee
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119188:4"/>
for unbeleef? or what diſcouragement can there
bee to any not to come and drink freely of this
open-fountain? onely mans will ſtands in the
way, until it bee over-powered by ſpecial grace,
the unſealing of that great ſecret of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.
I ſay in theſe things hee was wonderfully
inſtructed, and able to inſtruct.</p>
            <p>2 But as was his Knowledge, ſo was his Faith,
his head was not ſo full of the one, as his heart was
of the other, that as Chriſt ſaid to the woman of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> Mat. 15. 28. <hi>O woman, great is thy Faith,
&amp;c.</hi> ſo it may bee ſaid of him, great was his Faith.
A taſte of which I ſhall give, as it was taken from
himſelf on his death-bed, ſpeaking of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:119188:5"/>
Children, live like Chriſtians, and I leave you
the Covenant to feed upon.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1, 15, 28, 29. cap. 3. 7, 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 21. My
little Children, theſe things write I unto you, that yee ſin
not. And if any man ſin, wee have an Advocate with
the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous. Love not the
world, neither the things that are in the world. If any
man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
And now, little Children, abide in him, that when hee
ſhall appear, wee may have confidence, and not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
before him at his coming. If yee know that hee
is righteous, yee know that every one which doth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
is born of him. Little Children let no man
deceive you: hee that doth righteouſneſs is righteous,
even as hee is righteous. My little Children, let us not
love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed, and in truth.
Little Children, keep your ſelves from Idols. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Love not this world,</hi> I ſay unto you, it is not good
that you ſhould love the world.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 15, 16, 17. Love not the world, neither
the things that are in the world. If any man love the
world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all
that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the
eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of
the world. And the world paſſeth away, and the luſt
thereof: but hee that doth the will of God, abideth for
ever.</p>
            <p>Thus wee ſee, not onely his clearneſs in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, but the ſtrength of his Faith, even
unto a high pitch of Aſſurance, and triumph, with
exceeding ſpiritual joy and rejoycing; And yet
with a deep and ſoul-debaſing ſenſe of his own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and unworthineſs, thereby magnifying to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119188:6"/>
much the more the Riches of Gods Grace, with
his deep apprehenſions of the dreadful conſequence
of deſpiſing the ſame, or turning it into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or by drawing back from our holy profeſſion
and obedience after Conviction, Illumination, and
ſome taſte of the heavenly Gift, ſo falling into the
hands of the <hi>Living God,</hi> which is a fearful thing.
But as to his Faith, had it not been great, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the many trials and afflictions, terrours and
temptations hee was under, before theſe times, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and after his turn to God, And the difficulties
and dangers hee encountred with, with continual
ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ard of life in his military employments; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
much more than ever, ſince called to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of theſe Nations, a burden of its ſelf too
heavy for any man or men to bear, without a
mighty power of God: I ſay, conſidering all this,
had hee not been ſtrong in Faith, hee had ſunk
long ago.</p>
            <p>In the next place, let us conſider the exerciſe of
his Faith, in a few experiences of many (wherein
hee was Rich) declared by himſelf, and which
were not ordinary, But ſuch as few (I think) of the
choiceſt Saints have attained unto, one whereof
was as followeth.</p>
            <p>Being at <hi>Edinborough</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it pleaſed the
Lord to exerciſe him with ſore ſickneſſe, a high
and dangerous Feavor, whereby hee was brought
ſo low, that his Phyſicians and others had little or
no hopes in reaſon of his recovery; For one fit of
his diſtemper having laſted about twelve hours,
Immediately a ſecond fit returned upon him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any intermiſſion, for as long a time, and likely
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119188:6"/>
to have continued in that extremity, until there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee had expired. But behold this was Gods
opportunity to ſhew his Power, and to magnifie
his Word, a Portion whereof by the hand of the
Spirit of the Lord was then given in unto him, not
onely to feed his Faith, and revive his heart, but
alſo to rebuke his Diſeaſe, <hi>which immediately left
him,</hi> to the aſtoniſhment of himſelf and others, it
being little leſs than a miracle. For his Diſtemper
returned no more upon him, but the Lord raiſed
him up, intending further to uſe and honour him,
as hee hath done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scripture is,</hi> Pſal. 91. 14, 15, 16. Becauſe
hee hath ſet his love upon mee, therefore will I deliver
him: I will ſet him on high; becauſe hee hath known my
Name. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. Hee ſhall call upon mee, and I will
anſwer him: I will bee with him in trouble, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him, and honour him. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. With long life will
I ſatisfie him, and ſhew him my ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Which Promiſes, as then his Relief, ſo all along
in every condition, have been eminently made
good unto him in his own experiences, and would
bee of good uſe to others, had not his own back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs
in uttering any thing wherein hee might
ſeem to glory, for the moſt part concealed them.</p>
            <p>But as in ſickneſs, ſo alſo in the high places of
the field, as at <hi>Dunbar, Worceſter,</hi> and elſewhere,
when hee carried his life in his hand, ready to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up the ſame, as a willing Sacrifice in the great
<hi>Cauſe of God,</hi> and his People, Did not his Faith
then work at a more than ordinary rate? inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that ſucceſſe and victory was in his eye,
whilſt fears and deſpondencies did oppreſſe the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119188:7"/>
hearts of others, and ſome good men too, when
great diſcouragements, and that not groundleſs as
to the ſtrongeſt reaſon, did lye in the way; I ſay,
was hee not like another <hi>David,</hi> not fearing the
face of any <hi>Goliah,</hi> nor the over-matching numbers
and ſtrength of <hi>Enemies?</hi> Yea like thoſe <hi>Worthies,</hi>
Heb. 11. did hee not <hi>by Faith ſuddue Kingdomes,
work Righteouſneſs, obtain Promiſes, ſtop the mouths of
Lions, quench the violence of flames, eſcape the
edge of the ſword, out of weakneſs made ſtrong, wax
valiant in fight, and turn to flight the Armies of
Aliens?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although I will not ſay, that his Faith alone
had a hand in theſe ſucceſſes (yet not the leaſt) but
all the people of God by Faith and Prayer had a
great ſhare therein, which muſt vigorouſly bee
kept up ſtill, if wee deſire to proſper. But this by
the way, being of publick concernment, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
known to many others than my ſelf.</p>
            <p>And therefore to come nearer, a few daies after
the death of the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> his Daughter, at
<hi>Hampton Court,</hi> which toucht him nearly, being
then himſelf under bodily diſtempers, forerunners
to his ſickneſſe, which was to death, and in his
Bed-chamber, hee called for his Bible, and deſired
a perſon honourable and godly, then (with others)
preſent, to read unto him, <hi>Phil. 4. 11. 12. 13. Not
that I ſpeak in reſpect of want, but I have learnt in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſtate</hi> I <hi>am, therewith to bee content;</hi> I <hi>know both
how to bee abaſed, and how to abound, every where, and
in all things</hi> I <hi>am inſtructed, both to bee full, and to bee
hungry, both to abound, and to ſuffer need. v.</hi> 13. I <hi>can
do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:119188:7"/>
Which read, ſaid hee (to uſe his own words
as near as I can remember them) This Scripture
did once ſave my life, when my eldeſt Son—
died, which went as a dagger to my heart, indeed
it did.</p>
            <p>And then repeating the words of the Text him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
declared his then thoughts to this purpoſe,
reading the 10th. and 11th. <hi>verſes</hi> of <hi>Pauls</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation
and Submiſſion to the Will of God in all
conditions (ſaid hee) 'tis true, <hi>Paul,</hi> you have
learnt this, and attained to this meaſure of grace,
but what ſhall I do? Ah poor creature, it is a hard
leſſon for mee to take out, I finde it ſo! But read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on to the 13th. <hi>verſe,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, I <hi>can
do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth mee,</hi>
Then Faith began to work, and his heart to finde
ſupport and comfort, ſaying thus to himſelf, Hee
that was <hi>Pauls</hi> Chriſt, is my Chriſt too; And ſo
drew waters out of the well of ſalvation, Chriſt,
in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>But a little nearer yet, after his return to <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
his ſickneſſe increaſing upon him, hee was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to bee in a very ſpiritual frame of heart, and
full of holy expreſſions, catched up by one or other
fearing God that were preſent, as a hungry man
doth meat. A little whereof it was my comfort to
meet with, the very night before the Lord took
him to his everlaſting reſt, which were to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truly God is good, indeed hee is, hee will not—</hi>there
his ſpeech failed him, but as I apprehend it, it was,
<hi>hee will not leave mee;</hi> this ſaying that God was good,
hee frequently uſed all along, and would ſpeak it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119188:8"/>
with much chearfulneſſe and fervour of ſpirit in the
midſt of his pains.</p>
            <p>Again, hee ſaid, I would bee willing to live to
bee further ſerviceable to God and his People,
but my work is done, yet God will bee with his
People.</p>
            <p>Hee was very reſtleſſe moſt part of the night,
ſpeaking often to himſelf. And there being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to drink offered him, hee was deſired to take
the ſame, and endeavour to ſleep, unto which hee
anſwered,
<q>It is not my deſign to drink or to ſleep, but my deſign
is to make what haſte I can to bee gone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards towards morning, uſing divers holy
expreſſions, implying much inward conſolation
and peace, among the reſt hee ſpake ſome exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſelf-debaſing words, annihilating and judging
himſelf. And truly it was obſerved, that a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ſpirit to Gods cauſe did breath in him (as in
his life-time) ſo now to the very laſt, which will
further appear by that Prayer hee put up to God
two or three daies before his end, which was as
followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LORD,</hi> Although I am a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and wretched Creature, I am
in Covenant with thee, through
Grace, And I may, I will come to
thee for thy people, thou haſt made
mee (though very unworthy) a mean
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119188:8"/>
Inſtrument to do them ſome good,
and thee ſervice; And many of them
have ſet too high a value upon mee,
though others wiſh, and would bee
glad of my Death; But Lord, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou doſt diſpoſe of mee, continue
and go on to do good for them, Give
them conſiſtency of Judgement, one
heart, and mutual love, and go on to
deliver them, and with the work of
Reformation, and make the Name of
Chriſt glorious in the world; Teach
thoſe who look too much upon thy
inſtruments, to depend more upon thy
ſelf; Pardon ſuch as deſire to trample
upon the duſt of a poor worm, for they
are thy People too. And pardon the
folly of this ſhort Prayer, then for
Jeſus Chriſts ſake, and give us a
good night, if it be thy pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Some variation there is of his Prayer, as to the
account divers give of it, and ſomething is here
omitted; But this is certain, that theſe were his
Requeſts, wherein his heart was ſo carried out
for God and his People, yea for them who had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no little ſorrow to his grief and afflictions that
at this time hee ſeems to forget even his own
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119188:9"/>
Family, and neareſt Relations.</p>
            <p>And thus wee ſee in part ſomething of the
clearneſſe and ſtrength of his Faith in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace; and ſome taſts of the exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in a few of his experiences, with the excellency
of his ſpirit in prayer; And that ſpiritual and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
frame of heart breathing forth in him, even to
the laſt period of his life, whoſe name ſhall and
will bee as ointment poured out, notwithſtanding
the mouth of envy.</p>
            <p>But further, that we may ſee his Faith was not
alone, nor an idle Faith, let us conſider him in
his other Graces and Excellencies, in ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of his Converſation in general,
which was worthy Imitation of the moſt eminent
Saints, And that ſince he arrived at that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
unto which God raiſed him, which cauſed
no abatement in him (conſiderable) as uſually it
doth in men: But rather as his power and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
was increaſed, ſo his talents were drawn
into exerciſe and uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>1 And firſt his Zeal for God, his Cauſe, his
Truth, his People, and the good of men, which
in a manner (as it was ſaid of Chriſt) did even eat
him up. Inſomuch that he did not count his
life dear to him, nor any thing elſe, ſo he might
be uſefull. What elſe engaged him in, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him through, the great Work of God, as
a prime and choice Inſtrument for ſo many years
together, with ſo much ſtedineſs and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as to the true aim and ſcope thereof, <hi>viz.
Gospel liberty, and Civil Right,</hi> &amp;c. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119188:9"/>
many difficulties, and diſcouragements,
ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> met with in ſome ſort. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
26. <hi>In Journeyings often, in Perils of Waters, in
Perils of Robbers, in Perils by mine own Country-men,
in Perils by the Heathen</hi> (Iriſh) <hi>in Perils in the City,
in Perils in the Wilderneſs, in Perils in the Sea, in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
among falſe Brethren, in Wearineſs and painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
&amp;c. Known unto all, much more than I can
expreſs it.</p>
            <p>2 Again, His Zeal did highly appear in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
the preaching of the Goſpel in its Power
and Purity, by the great incouragement he gave
to Godly Miniſters, And laying ſuch a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof, that the Generations to come may
reap the Benefit of it, If we ſin not away that
greateſt of mercies, as we have cauſe to fear. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
what care did he take to remove hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
out of the way, by diſcountenancing and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſide <hi>Idoll Shepherds,</hi> ſuch as were found <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and ſcandalous men, Dumb Dogs,</hi> ſuch as were
more ready to bark againſt Truth and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than able or willing to ſpeak for, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the ſame. Conſidering alſo the pains he
took in his own Perſon, in ſifting and finding out
mans worth, or worthleſneſs for ſo great a work,
eſpecially when his own Concernments did more
immediately require the ſame, which is known to
moſt, he being herein alſo a moſt rare example
to ſucceeding Rulers, and indeed the firſt of this
Kind in ſo high ſtate and Eminency.</p>
            <p>3 Again, His love to the Truth, unto which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119188:10"/>
he was a faithful Friend, Laborious in Contending
for it, Powerful in Conviction of the contrary,
and ſtopping the Mouth of Error; Having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to do by reaſon of his great place, with many
men of erring Judgements (as well as others) the
moſt obſtinate of whom I have often heard him
ſilence, diſcountenance their errors with greateſt
deteſtation, eſpecially when of Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
as once dealing with ſome of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
he rendred their opinions in the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and yet trueſt Character that ever I heard,
Saying, they were ſuch as took the Crown off
the head of Chriſt, diſrobed him of his Prieſtly
Garments, and denied his Prophetical Office,
by ſetting up a ſpirit of their own in the Room of
his, by the whole utterly making voyd his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip,
who is God bleſſed for ever, And that
he had rather be buried alive under a heap of
ſtones, than in the leaſt to countenance the ſame,
and much more, which I have now forgot.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, his heart being tender to all men,
eſpecially ſuch as were peaceable, he did not uſe
that ſeverity ordinarily towards them or others
of that kind, as was by ſome expected. But what
other conſideration did therein ſway him to ſo
much Lenity, I cannot tell, neither is it for eve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
one to know, much leſs to judge; but this we
know, that he was merciful to all.</p>
            <p>4 Again, His Zeal appeared in laying much
to heart the afflicted condition of Gods People
under Perſecution in other parts of the World,
and laying out his Power &amp; intereſt to the utmoſt he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119188:10"/>
could, for their ſuccour and relief, both by Arms
and Alms, whoſe ſorrows and ſufferings added not a
little to the grief of his Soul, and whom he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
much in his heart, as appeared by his publique
ſpirit to his dying hour, and 'tis ſufficiently known,
'twas the Proteſtant intereſt, ſo far as it had foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was mainly in his deſign in all his forein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings,
and not Riches, Honour, and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which moſt Princes have in their eye; And
from which he did not withdraw, notwithſtanding
diſcouragements; in which Principle if other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Princes and States were more firmly unite,
the Goſpel-Cauſe againſt its enemies would in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
better ſucceed.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>His Zeal appeared in his love to Juſtice, as
the Scripture ſpeaks of</hi> Job, Chap. 29. 16. ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the cauſe of the Widow, the Fatherleſs and the
Oppreſſed, <hi>and yet no reſpecter of perſons in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as commanded,</hi> Deut. 1. 17. Yee ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
perſons in judgement, but you ſhall hear the ſmall
as well as the great; you ſhall not be afraid of the face of
man; for the judgement is Gods: and the cauſe that is
too hard for you, bring it unto mee, and I will hear it.
<hi>And</hi> Levit. 19. 15. Yee ſhall do no unrighteouſneſs in
judgement: thou ſhalt not reſpect the perſon of the poor,
nor honour the perſon of the mighty: but in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
thou ſhalt judge thy neighbour.</p>
            <p>6 Again, His Zeal did ſhew forth its ſelf in
puniſhing of evil doers, eſpecially in his own fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
where looſeneſſe or prophaneneſſe durſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
or if it did, and came to his knowledge, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
Reſolution, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. was alſo his, that ſuch
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119188:11"/>
ſhould not dwell in his houſe, but were caſt out.
Beſides his readineſſe to countenance them that
were good, and did well, according to that Rule
<hi>Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3. Let every ſoul bee ſubject unto the
higher powers: For there is no power but of God. The
powers that bee, are ordained of God. Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God:
and they that reſist, ſhall receive to themſelves domna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For Rulers are not a terrour to good works, but
to the evill. Wilt thou then not bee afraid of the power?
do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the
ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were too hard a task for any to reckon up
all thoſe Graces which did ſhine forth in him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for mee; And therefore I ſhall touch onely
upon two or three more, wherein hee was a moſt
rare Example of Beleevers, and an excellent Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
for thoſe in higheſt Power.</p>
            <p>1 And firſt, His love to Saints, to all Saints,
and that as ſuch, although of different Judgements:
Unto whom hee was a Father, to protect them,
and care for their welfare, a friend, to favour
them in all juſt waies, and a peace-maker, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
them, at leaſt to carry things with that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
prudence and moderation towards them,
that ſo guiding them (as it was ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Pſal.
78. 72. <hi>So hee fed them according to the integrity of
his heart; and guided them by the skilfulneſs of his
hands.</hi>) With the skilfulneſſe of his hand, in theſe
dividing and divided times, that their diviſions,
through Gods mercy and bleſſing on his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors,
have not broken forth into a flame of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119188:11"/>
contention, as was feared by us, and
waited for by our enemies, thereby ſecuring our
Peace to this day continued to us.</p>
            <p>And truly, had not God furniſhed him with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
wiſdome this way, our condition had
been (in all likelikood) very ſad ere now, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the weak, forbearing the froward, and
injurious, and ready to forgive ſuch as appeared in
the poſture of enemies againſt him, upon the leaſt
appearance of penitency, yea many times in hopes
thereof, endeavouring after the Command and
Example of Chriſt, to overcome evil with good,
to the wonder of moſt men.</p>
            <p>2 Again, As his Love was great, the like rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bee found in the times was live in, ſo was
his Charity to the Poor, the Widow, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe,
and the Diſtreſſed. In which reſpect wee
may ſay of him, as <hi>Job</hi> of himſelf, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. 17.
<hi>Or have eaten my morſel my ſelf alone, and the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
hath not eaten thereof?</hi> Hee did never eat his
Morſels alone, a great many living upon his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Benevolence, who muſt otherwiſe have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
beſides occaſional diſtributions at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
with his readineſſe to promote by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and influence good works of this kind, as
well as by his own example; for which the ſouls of
thouſands have bleſſed him, even beyond the
Seas.</p>
            <p>3 And laſtly, His cloſeneſſe of communion and
converſe with God, not onely publickly, keeping
up, and waiting on Gods Ordinances, in the moſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119188:12"/>
ſolemn and ſet times of his worſhip with great Re-Reverence,
Attention, and Intention of ſpirit; But
alſo on other extraordinary occaſions, when Gods
providence called for it (whereof hee was a ſtrict
obſerver) in ſeeking his face with faſting and prayer,
and that with wonderful ſucceſſe, the Lord giving
in viſible Returns; And this (as I ſaid) not onely in
a publick way, but alſo in his family, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in his ſecret retirements. And indeed Prayer
(as one calls it) was his daily exerciſe, which hee
never neglected, notwithſtanding all his weighty
affairs, yea the more weighty and urgent they
were, the more hee buckled to it, and ſometimes
with ſuch fervour of ſpirit, that hee could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
himſelf, but with great breakings of heart,
ſend up ſtrong cries with tears unto God, heard,
when hee hath not known any to bee near him; ſo
that it may bee truly ſaid of him, that as hee was
a man (<hi>Abraham</hi>-like) ſtrong in Faith, ſo (like
<hi>Jacob</hi>) mighty in Prayer, and as a Prince prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God; ſuch as indeed in all reſpects this
Nation was never before bleſt with, to ſit in the
Throne, however hee was judged, and cenſured,
and lightly ſet by, by many who were not ſenſible
of our and their mercy, and who yet in time may
bee ſenſible (if God prevent not) of his Remove,
where his Prayers are turned into everlaſting
praiſes.</p>
            <p>And thus godlineſs was the true riſe of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and the root out of which hee ſprung into
publick uſe and ſerviceableneſs; whence as <hi>David</hi>
ſaith of ſuch a one, <hi>Pſal. 1. His leaf did not wither,
And whatſoever hee did</hi> (in the main) <hi>proſpered,</hi> even
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119188:12"/>
to the wonder and terrour of the world, And the
fruit he was eminently an Inſtrument to bring forth,
and deſigned more to do, was, that the cauſe of
God, and Reformation, might proſper in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yea as far as his head, heart or hand could
reach.</p>
            <p>And although by the fall of this great Branch,
the whole at preſent is much clouded, yet if thoſe
Branches ſtill (through Gods goodneſſe) remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſpring out of the ſame Root hee did (as it is
hoped) and go forth in the power of that Spirit, and
