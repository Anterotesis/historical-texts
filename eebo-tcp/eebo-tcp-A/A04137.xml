            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>¶And meruaylle thou not, that I haue now rehersed many thinges that thou kne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west before / nor that forgatte I not / but knewe well ynoughe, that beynge suche a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:26187:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
multitude as well of princis as of priuate persones / some of them haue spoken the same that I dyd, &amp; many haue harde it, &amp; dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers haue sene other men done it, and some there be that by them selfes haue experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it. Notwithstandyng in matter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge instructyon, noueltie is not to be souhgt for, for therin ought not to be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den eyther synguler opinion, or thynge im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possyble, or contrary to mens expectacyon, but suppose that to be in herynge mooste gracyouse or pleasaunte / whiche beynge sowen in the myndes of other, may assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble moste matter to the pourpose / and the same declare beste and mooste aptly. For this knowe I wel, that the counsayles and wyse sentences of poetes and other good authours, are thoughte of all menne to be very profytable: yet wyll not they gladly gyue eare vnto them, but be therwith in the same case, as they be with these that do giue them good counsayle: for they prayse them all, but they care not howe seldome they come in theyr company, desyrynge to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with offendours / than with them that of synne be the rebukers. Example we may take of the poemes or warkes of Hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus, Theognes, and Phocillides, for
<pb facs="tcp:26187:4"/>
euery man affyrmeth them to be excellent counsayles coucerning mannes lyfe, but al though they say so, yet had they leuer vse that, wherto theyr owne madnesse induceth them, than folowe that, wherto the others preceptes doeth aduyse them. Moreouer if one shuld gader out of the said authors that which men cal sentences, wherin they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance haue ben studiouse, in semblable wise towardes them shulde they be disposed, for they shuld with more plesure here a lyeng fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or fantasy, than the sayd preceptes made by moch connyng and diligence. But what nedeth it to tary longe vpon euery mater? Genyrally if we wyll consyder the natures of men, we shal perceiue, that many of them delyte neyther in meates that ben most hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, nor in studies that ben most honest, nor in dedes that is most conuenyent: nor yet in doctryne that is mooste commodiouse, but imbracynge pleasaunte appetites, whiche be repugnaunt to profite, wolde seme to be painful and laboriouse. How may any man content any suche persons, eyther by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge or teachyng, or tellyng of any thing that is profitable: that for the wordes that be spoken, do ennie and haue indygnacion at them that speke truly, and do take them
<pb facs="tcp:26187:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for playne men or symple, in whome lacketh wysedome: so moche they abhorre trouthe in all thynges, that they knowe not what is theyrs, or do belong to their office, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultynge or raysonynge of that which doth partayne vnto them / they be sadde and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasaunte, whan they talke of other mennes affayres they be merye and ioyouse. More ouer they hadde leuer suffre some griefe in their bodies / than in reuoluyng what shuld be moste necessary, trauayle any thyng in theyr mindes. And if a man take good hede, he shall fynde in theyr mutuall assembles and companies, that eyther they reproue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, or els that they of other be in some thynge reproued. And whan they be by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfes / they be euer wisshinge and neuer con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sultinge. I haue not spoken this agayne all men but only againe them that be giltie in that which I haue rehersed. Finally this is apparraunte and certayne, who so euer wyl make or wryte any thynge pleasaunte and thankfull to the multytude, he may not seke for wordes or maters moste profitable / but for them that contayne most fables and lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>synges. For in herynge such thynges they reioyce: but whan they perceyne to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and contentions in theyr affayres / 
<pb facs="tcp:26187:5"/>
than be they pensife. Wherfore Homere and they that founde fyrst Tragedyes, may be well maruayled at, who in theyr warkes vsed bothe the sayd fourmes in wrytynge, for Homere expressed in the contencions and batayles of them / whiche for theyr ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were named halfe goddes, the other brought those fables in to actuall appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, in so moche as we not onely may here them, but also may presently beholde them, by such example it is declared to them that be studiouse to please their herers, that they must abstayne frome exhortynge and counsayllynge them, and that they apply them to wryte and speke that onely / where in they perceyue the multitude to haue most delectation. This before wrytten haue I declared, thynkynge that it besemeth not the that are not one of the people, to be of lyke opynyon with the multytude, nor to iudge thynges to be honest, or men to be plesaunt, accordynge to thy sensuall appetite / but to trye and esteme them by theyr good and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fytable actes. Moreouer for as moche as they that labour in the study of Philosophy, concernynge the exercyse of the myndes, be of sundry opynions, some sayenge that men become wiser by moche disputynge and ray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sonyng,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:26187:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other affyrme that it hapneth by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercyse in polytyke gouernaunce or cyuill cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, dyuers suppose it to come of other doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trynes: but finally they all do confesse, that he whiche is well brought vp, may by euery of the sayd studyes gather mater suffycient to geue good counsayle. Therfore he that wyll leaue the doubtfull opinions / and wyl apply to that which is certayne, he must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amyne the raysons therof, and specyally they that be counsailors ought to haue con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sideration of the occasyon, tyme, and opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunyte, if they can not brynge that to passe, than to reiecte and put a way as well them which speke in al maters generally, as also those that knowe nothynge that is expedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or necessary, for it is apparante and cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne, that he whiche can not be to him selfe profitable, he shall in other mens busynesse do nothyng wisely, make moch of them that be wyse, and do perceyue more than other men, and haue good regarde towarde them: remembrynge that a good counsaylour,<note place="margin">A good counsail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note> is of all other treasure the most royal and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fytable, and thynke veryly that they which can most ayde and profyte to thy wytte or reason, shall make thy kyngedome moste ample and honorable. wherfore for my part

as moch as I can, I haue exhorted the, and honored the with such presentes as be in my power to geue the. And desyre thou not / that other men shuld bryng vnto the (as I sayde at the begynnynge) theyr accustomed presentes, which ye shulde bye moch derer of the giuers, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the sellers: but couaite thou suche presentes, which if thou do vse well and dylygently ommyttynge no tyme, thou not onely shalt not consume them, but thou shalte also encrease them, and make them of more estimation and value.</p>
