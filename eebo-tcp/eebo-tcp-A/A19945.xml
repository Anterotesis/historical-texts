            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My friends names I concealed; mine owne and my brothers, I willed the Printer to suppresse, as well as I had concealed the other, which he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing put in without my priuity, we must now vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a sharper censure perhaps then our namelesse workes should haue done, and I especially. For if their Poems be liked, the praise is due to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention: if disliked, the blame both by them, and all men, will be deriued vpon mee, for publishing that which they meant to suppresse.</p>

            <p>For these Poems in particular, I could alledge these excuses, that those vnder the name of <hi>Anonymos</hi> were written (as appeareth by diuers things to Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> liuing, and of him dead) almost twenty yeares since, when Poetry was farre from that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to which it hath now attained; that my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is by profession a Souldier, and was not 18 years old when he writ these toyes: that mine owne were made most of them sixe or seuen yeares since, at idle

I am a Marriner, and am now come from the sea, where I had the fortune to light vpon these few trifles. I must confesse I came but lightly by them, but I no sooner had them, but I made a vow that as they came to my hands by fortune, so I would not part with them but by fortune. To that end I haue euer since carried these Lots about me, that if I met with fit company I might deuide my booty among them. And now (I thanke my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune) I am lighted into the best company of the world, a company of the fairest Ladies that euer I saw. Come Ladies trie your fortunes, and if any light vpon an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate blanke, let her thinke that fortune doth but mocke her in these trifles, and meanes to pleasure her in greater matters.</hi>

                  <l>PRaise, pleasure, profit, is that threefold band,</l>
                  <l>Which ties mens minds more fast then Gordions knot</l>
                  <l>Each one some drawes, all three none can withstand,</l>
                  <l>Of force conioynde, Conquest is heardly got.</l>
                  <l>Then musicke may of hearts a Monarch be,</l>
                  <l>Wherein praise, pleasure, profit so agree.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Praise-worthy Musicke is, for God it praiseth,</l>
                  <l>And pleasant, for brute beasts therein delight,</l>
                  <l>Great profit from it flowes, for why it raiseth</l>
                  <l>The mind ouerwhelmed with rude passions might:</l>
                  <l>When against reason passions fond rebell,</l>
                  <l>Musicke doth that confirme, and those expell.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>If Musicke did not merit endlesse praise,</l>
                  <l>Would heauenly Spheares delight in siluer round?</l>
                  <l>If ioyous pleasure were not in sweete layes,</l>
                  <l>Would they in Court and Country so abound?</l>
                  <l>And profitable needes we must that call,</l>
                  <l>Which pleasure linkt with praise doth bring to all.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Heroick minds with praises most incited,</l>
                  <l>Seeke praise in Musicke and therein excell:</l>
                  <l>God, man, beasts, birds, with Musicke are delighted,</l>
                  <l>And pleasant t'is which pleaseth all so well.</l>
                  <l>No greater profit is then selfe content:</l>
                  <l>And this will Musicke bring, and care preuent.</l>

                  <l>When antique Poets Musicks praises tell,</l>

                  <l>To proue more dull then stones, then beasts more fell,</l>
                  <l>Those men which pleasing Musicke did not loue,</l>
                  <l>They fain'd, it Citties built, and states defended</l>

                  <l>In sicknesse, health, peace, warre, we doe it need,</l>
