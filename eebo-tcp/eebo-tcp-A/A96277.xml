         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
IMPARTIALL,
AND
Juditious Reader.</head>
            <p>IT is high time, now, after ſo many affronts, and ſuch multiplicity of ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and ſcornfull Language, uttered againſt me, in ſeverall ſilly Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
by that profeſt Mountebanke in Aſtrology, <hi>(John Bookes,)</hi> to
vindicate my ſelfe from the Calumnies, Scandalls, and falſe Accuſations,
which his unſatiable Ambition, and implacable malice, hath moſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
accuſed me of: And thereby I ſhall diſcover, how much his Envy, (to my
Penne and Perſon) hath tranſported him beyond the bound of modeſty, and
rendered him incapable both of Reaſon and Knowledge, in the Art, whereof
be profeſſes himſelfe to be a Maſter. I have in part anſwered M. <hi>Lilly,</hi> in my
<hi>Prognoſtication</hi> for the enſuing yeare 1647. And here, (according to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe)
I ſhall <hi>Catechiſe John Booker,</hi> and both of them, as occaſion ſerves. The
ſubject or matter, here intended, is, the notable <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the 2. Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Planets in the Signe <hi>Taurus,</hi> upon the 12. <hi>of June</hi> this yeare, 1646. the
effects whereby will be in great force, untill the 21. day of <hi>October</hi> 1647.
Which <hi>Conjunction</hi> hath lately beene moſt ignorantly treated of, by <hi>John Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
in a certaine Pamphlet of his ſtiled <hi>A Bloody Iriſh Almanacke, &amp;c.</hi> and
many falſe obſervations he hath drawn thence, and publiſhed; not upon any
reall grounds in <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> but merely out of his inveterate malice, and hatred
to the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland;</hi> whereby both that and this Kingdome have beene
deluded, and Aſtrology ſhamefully perverted and defamed. In which reſpect
(as likewiſe (upon this occaſion) to free my ſelfe, from his former Aſpertions)
I have publiſhed the following diſcourſe, wherein the ſame <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,</hi>
and <hi>Mars,</hi> is more Artificially handled: and alſo their future <hi>Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
(with a touch concerning their next <hi>Conjunction,</hi> which will happen in the
Signe <hi>Gemini,</hi> (the Aſcendent of London) which will be farre more terrible,
and of greater concernment to <hi>London,</hi> and other parts of this Kingdome; then
the <hi>Conjunction</hi> in <hi>Taurus</hi> can be to <hi>Ireland:</hi> I have palpably unmasked his
malice, diſcovered his ignorance, divulged and corrected his Errours, and
miſapplications of the Effects of this celeſtiall meeting: If his immodeſt Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
hath any where incited me to too much freedome of ſpeech; I ſhall
crave his excuſe, when he beggs my Pardon, for his former Inſolencies: I hate
<pb facs="tcp:159928:3"/>
not his (or any mans) perſon, but his Sinne. The method is Rough caſt, (like
my ſelfe) if the matter be better poliſhed, I care not: I know, I ſhall not
pleaſe all (neither would I) ſome for want of judgement, and ſome for want of
Love, and others for lack of Loyalty will condemne me; but none of theſe doe
I regard: It is to the impartiall, and juditious I appeale, and to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(onely) will I ſubmit. And if they pleaſe to adventure but their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as I have done my Paines, (which is not a little) I doubt not of the iſſue:
I have no ungodly ends, in this, or any other of my writings, my Wiſhes are
full as good, as <hi>John Bookers:</hi> I wiſh all happyneſſe to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queenes
Majeſty,</hi> and the <hi>Royall Progeny,</hi> and an end to the Miſeries of this languiſhing
Kingdome. I love, and wiſh for the <hi>Booke</hi> of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> againe, that was
Sealed with the Blood of ſo many <hi>Martyrs,</hi> till which be, I expect not to ſee
Religion in its Priſtine puritie. I delight not in <hi>War,</hi> not can I pray for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt

of their <hi>Nativities:</hi> But to the intent that this barking mungrell
may not delude the ignorant with his pedling traſh, nor detract
from, or otherwiſe abuſe a whole Nation, with his nauceous, and
menacing expreſſions: I have aſſumed a liberty of publiſhing this
following Diſcourſe, which is void of all envy, malice, or partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but freely, modeſtly, and ſincerely, relating whatſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
this <hi>Coeleſtiall meeting,</hi> according to the rules of Art, and
the judgement of the moſt approved Aſtrologers, ancient, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern:
wherein the judicious and indifferent Readers may plainly

and orderly perceive the ignorance and malice of this trifling para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite:
and rightly underſtand, the nature and quality of the effects
of this <hi>coeleſtiall congreſſe,</hi> when they ſhall begin to operate, how
long continue, what Nations, or Countries are therein principally

concluding, whether or no, that (ſo long) oppreſſed Kingdome,
be ordained for the ſtage, whereon ſuch bloudy-minded hel-hounds
(as himſelfe) are to perpetrate their cruelty.</p>
            <p>I will not trouble the judicious Reader with any examples of
ſuch events, as have formerly happened in England or elſwhere,
upon the like Conjunctions: For that I acknowledge him to have
collect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d in part.</p>
            <p>But I will firſt examine the foundation, whereupon he hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
this ſo deformed a ſtructure, and accordingly proceed, either by
adhering to him where he hath ſtumbled on any truth, or in diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from, and correcting him, where I meet with his miſtakes, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and malice.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I will artificially erect the <hi>Figure</hi> of heaven, according
to the doctrine of <hi>Regio montanus,</hi> to the <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>apparent</hi> time of
this <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and afterwards compare it with that, which <hi>Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
hath publiſhed (for I dare not take this (or any other) upon
truſt either from him or M. <hi>Lillie)</hi> whereby, I ſhall preſume, not

<q>Having intreated my loving friend M. <hi>Mathew Fiske,</hi> to give

compaſſe the true moment of any <hi>Conjunction.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a modeſt and ingenous acknowledgement of M. <hi>Lillies</hi>
want of skill in <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> for you ſee, he was fain to be beholden
to M. <hi>Fiske</hi> for calculating the <hi>Conjunctions</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi>

            <p>And by this I ſee, tis no wonder, that M. <hi>Lilly</hi> ſhould miſtake ſo

that ſhee excedeth all the reſt of the Planets, in number of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes:
<hi>Saturne</hi> is next, as having 15. teſtimonies of ſtrength:
<hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> are likewiſe all very powerfull. The
<hi>Moone</hi> is very infortunate, and the <hi>Sun</hi> is the weakeſt in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
being out of all his <hi>eſſentiall dignities, ſlow in motion,</hi> and in

            </p>
            <p>Thus much being rightly known, and underſtood, it will be
no difficult matter to fore-ſee, what (in all probability) may be the
naturall quality of the effects of this Conjunction, if wee ſtick
but cloſe to the known rules of Art, (whence both M. <hi>Lilly</hi> and
<hi>Booker</hi> doe ordinarily deviate) and avoid the vaine and tedious
loquacity, wherewith they ſo often, and much torment us: you
ſee (M. <hi>Lilly)</hi> I have followed <hi>Origanus</hi> in not making <hi>Venus</hi> and
<hi>Mercury</hi> fortifyed by their <hi>Orientality;</hi> (as I did, <hi>Anno</hi> 1645. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my <hi>Aſtrologicall judgement, 7. May,</hi> according to <hi>Pez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lius,</hi>
(who maketh no diſtinction, as you may ſee, <hi>Pag.</hi> 47.) becauſe I
would avoid all future cavills upon this occaſion: But (by the way)
I ſhall exhort you and <hi>Iohn Booker</hi> to ſuſpend your uſuall ſnarling,
touching the fallibility of that Diſcourſe; for your opprobrious ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
cannot injure me with men of moderate judgement; nor can
the frequent and eager reiterating thereof, cloake or excuſe your ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
in point of Art: what I then writ, was according to a
<hi>ſuppoſed time</hi> taken, and delivered me (by a<note n="*" place="margin">Capt. <hi>E. A;</hi>
               </note> Gentleman of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.)
And you know, in this caſe, the <hi>Tempus aeſtimatum</hi> is not to
be rectified as in <hi>Nativities:</hi> I know no true <hi>Trutina</hi> for that
(Sirs.) And a few minutes error in time, will alter the whole
face of heaven; which muſt needs vary the judgement, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from a different poſition; I was requeſted to deliver my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
according to the time given me, which was as you ſaw: yet
I never intended it for the Preſſe, had not the importunity of ſome
friends prevailed with me. And I am able to maintaine the ſame
opinion (in point of Art) according to the time ſuppoſed, againſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:159928:12"/>
the proudeſt State-pleaſer that date oppoſe me. But admit what
what you would have the world to beleeve, That it had been an
error of judgement, without relation had to any miſtake in time;
why (I pray Sirs) is not an error in the <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> as tolerable as
in the <hi>Divine, Phyſitian,</hi> or <hi>Lawyer,</hi> or in men of any other profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Is the <hi>Divines</hi> judgment alwayes <hi>Goſpel?</hi> Does the <hi>Phyſitian</hi>

as we are men, we muſt be ſubject to infirmities, over-ſights, and
errors; <hi>Humanum eſt errare.</hi> And (which is more) it is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of <hi>God,</hi> many times, to fruſtrate the portents of heaven, for
the ſins of the people; who otherwiſe might partake of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
ſweetneſſe and benignity. It was a wiſe ſaying of a learned
Divine, yet living, That <hi>When God will have a people beaten, he ties
their hands behind them.</hi> And this (I am ſure) hath been the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe
of the <hi>Loyall partie:</hi> But ſhall therefore the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi>
be blamed for adhering to the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of his <hi>Art?</hi> I
wonder with what truth M. <hi>Lilly</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> laſt, prognoſticated of
loſſe to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and of any <hi>Motion</hi> of their <hi>Army Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi>

prevailed in every place of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> by one meanes or other;
and that they had no need of ſending any Forces into the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
And in the ſame month of <hi>Iuly,</hi> what intended he, thinke you,
where he tatled of an <hi>Army</hi> wandring neere <hi>Oxford?</hi> You ſee by

For as it is not enough for an Artiſt to content himſelfe alone with
the Rules and Obſervations of his Predeceſſors, but that he ought
to adde ſomething of his owne, whereby to propagate the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which he ſtudies: No more is it lawfull for any man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
the world with the fooliſhneſſe of his owne deluded fancy,
and idle conceptions alone, as both Maſter <hi>Lilly</hi> and <hi>Booker</hi> have
frequently done, without any Reaſon given, or Authority quoted
for their Opinions.</p>
            <p>As for the miſtake (I will not ſay malice) of that <hi>Practicioner

<hi>Predictions defended, &amp;c.</hi> who in the 49. page of that Booke, doth
wrongfully intimate (to my diſparagement) as if I ſhould ſay, that
a <hi>Fixed Star</hi> might properly be ſaid to be <hi>Aſpected</hi> with any <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net:</hi>

laſh, in that I am moſt certaine, he cannot produce any ſuch
aſſertion of mine, either in word or writing. It is true, that Maſter
<hi>Lilly</hi> taxed me for ſaying that <hi>Mars</hi> was in a <hi>Sextile Aſpect</hi> with
<hi>Caput Draconis,</hi> in my <hi>Almanack</hi> 1645. which was an error of
the Preſſe: (the Character of <hi>Caput Draconis</hi> being miſtaken for
the Character of <hi>Leo,</hi> as I have ſufficiently proved in my Anſwer
to M. <hi>Lilly,</hi> printed with my <hi>Prognoſtication</hi> for 1647.) but that
I ever mentioned any <hi>Fixed Star</hi> to be aſpected by any <hi>Planet,</hi> in
that, or any other of my Writings, (unleſſe M. <hi>Harflete</hi> will ſay
that the <hi>Dragons head</hi> is a <hi>fixed ſtar)</hi> is both frivolous and falſe:
And therefore I ſhall deſire that Criticall Gentleman to examine
the words of my <hi>Prognoſtication</hi> for that yeere, and my aforeſaid
Anſwers to M. <hi>Lilly's</hi> Objections, and I preſume he will ſhew me
ſo much civility as to revoke that his unadviſed cenſure, and excuſe
me of ignorance in that particular: And yet I could have ſtopped

            <p>The next thing I ſhall deſire the indifferent Reader to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, is, his owne <hi>Scheme</hi> of this <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and in it the <hi>Cuſpe</hi>
of the 5. <hi>houſe,</hi> as he hath made it; and you may obſerve that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi>
and <hi>Mars,</hi> are but 2. <hi>degrees 33. min.</hi> diſtant from the ſame:
Yet yevertheleſſe in the 37. page of his Pamphlet, he taketh his
judgement from the 4. <hi>Houſe,</hi> which is contrary to <hi>Origanus,</hi> and
divers other Authors, and to M. <hi>Lilly</hi> likewiſe, who allow 5. deg.
preceding, and 5. deg. ſubſequent for the <hi>Cuſpe</hi> of each Houſe: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which Rule, he ought to have given judgement from
the 5. Houſe, and not from the 4. You remember <hi>(Jack)</hi> how M.
<hi>Lilly</hi> ſpit his venome at me, in the 35. page of his <hi>Anglicus</hi> for
1645. for giving judgement of <hi>Iupiters</hi> being in the 4. and
<hi>Mars</hi> in the 6. (according to the opinion of <hi>Rhemetius)</hi> when
they were within leſſe then 5. deg. of the <hi>Cuſpes</hi> of the 5. and
7. <hi>Houſe.</hi> Now, I wonder much, how you dare diſſent from
your <hi>loving friend M. Lilly,</hi> eſpecially in this particular, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what you ſaid in your laſt page of your Epiſtle to the Reader,
<hi>viz. That M. Lilly and you have the ſame principles in Art, and
that your judgements in the generall will have anſwerable ſucceſſe.</hi>
And, that M. <hi>Lilly</hi> may ſee, it is no miſtake in you, but meere opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
let him peruſe your Prog. for this yeere 1646. and in the
<hi>Spring-Quarter</hi> he ſhall find you giving judgement upon <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury's
being in the 10. Houſe;</hi> when in M. <hi>Lilly's</hi> owne Scheme
(erected for the ſame Latitude, Meridian, and moment of time)
he wanteth but 2. deg. and 9. min. of the 11. <hi>Houſe.</hi> And now
<hi>(lack)</hi> doe you think M. <hi>Lilly</hi> will not ſhake his head at you, for
this groſſe contradiction? would he have thought it poſſible that
his fellow-champion (in <hi>State-Aſtrologie) Iohn Booker,</hi> would
have contradicted him, and joyned in opinion with thoſe two
<hi>Malignants, Naworth</hi> and <hi>Wharton</hi> at <hi>Oxford? O tempora, O
mores!</hi> I cannot pretermit another of his errors in the ſame <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>page</hi> of his <hi>Prog.</hi> where he ſayes that <hi>Iupiter is free from all

that you will ſuffer this <hi>Ideot</hi> in Aſtrologie, to profeſſe himſelfe
<hi>joynt-purchaſer</hi> with you, in your <hi>Principles,</hi> that hath not yet lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the <hi>A. B. C.</hi> of <hi>Aſtronomy.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:159928:14"/>
But have your judgements anſwerable ſucceſſe? I will examine
that alſo.</p>
            <p>If <hi>M. Lilly</hi> had handled the Scheme of this <hi>Conjunction,</hi> or if
you <hi>(Iack)</hi> had followed his <hi>Principles,</hi> it is evident by what I
have ſaid, that the judgement ſhould have been deduced from the
5. houſe and not from the 4. which (according to <hi>Haly, Part. 8. c.</hi>
7.) would have afforded thus much for the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> viz. <hi>Si quando
Saturnus fuerit in domo quinta fortunatus ſignificat quod homines
gaudebunt ſuis filiis, &amp; quod ſenes multo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

villarum habebunt bonum &amp; utilitatem, ex parte altertus gentis, &amp;
ex parte filiorum.</hi> Which is (in effect) That when <hi>Saturne</hi> ſhall
be fortunate in the 5. <hi>houſe,</hi> he ſignifieth, that men ſhall rejoyce in
their Children; And that Aged men, and Head-Officers (or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates)
of Townes ſhall reap much good and commoditie by the
helpe of another nation, and by meanes of their Children.</p>
            <p>And this is the judgement which ſhould have beene given upon
that poſition, if you had followed M. <hi>Lilly's Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here (by the way) I beſeech the indifferent Reader to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of <hi>Bookers</hi> inveterate hatred and malice to the diſtreſſed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Ireland:</hi> For, as he neither will, nor dare ſpeak or write
one jot of truth, which may ſeeme any whit fatall to the <hi>States:</hi>
ſo he is fully reſolved to ſmother all things that tend to the good
and ſafety of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, if he had taken his judgement from the 5. <hi>Houſe</hi> (as Maſter
<hi>Lilly</hi> will acknowledge he ought to have done) he muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
have delivered us the precedent judgement; but that, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be too good for that Kingdome: For (thought <hi>Iohn
Booker)</hi> that Aphoriſme ſayes, they ſhal take pleaſure in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and intimates much joy and aſſiſtance to them: as though
ſome Nation were reſolved to come in to their help, and engage
in the <hi>War</hi> againſt the <hi>States:</hi> which I muſt not mention; for by
that meanes, I may diſanimate the <hi>States-Soldiers,</hi> which are to be
ſent thither, if they ſhould perceive <hi>Ireland</hi> to be ſo powerfull:
And on the other ſide, I ſhould encourage <hi>Ireland</hi> to purſue their
deſigne with greater Policy, Courage and Reſolution. No, No,
the thing which I am to endeavour, is to tumble out Victory upon
Victory to the <hi>States,</hi> and make mention of nothing but utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
deſolation, and confuſion to that barbarous Nation, And aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſuch of the Brethren as have contributed towards the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>the Godly and bleſſed Warre againſt Ireland,</hi> ſhall have Land
<hi>by the Belly:</hi> And therefore, though it be never ſo repugnant to my
Rules, He rather take my judgement from the <hi>unfortunate poſition</hi>
of <hi>Saturne</hi> in the <hi>fourth houſe;</hi> and ſo I ſhall have matter enough,
and meet for the purpoſe: For, <hi>Saturnus in quarta demo, &amp; ibi
malificus ſignificat quodres, &amp; adificia cadent, minuentur plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones,
&amp; abſcindentur aquae, &amp;c.</hi> He there ſignifieth, that Houſes
and Buildings ſhall fall, come to decay and periſh, planting or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſhall be diminiſhed, waters cut off, the people ſhall be leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or abated, there ſhall be poverty to them, and the people of that
Country ſhall be obſeſſed, or beſieged, they ſhall not dare to goe out
of their Towne, (Cities, Caſtles, or Countries) by reaſon of the fear
they ſhall have of their enemies: and this ſhall be more certaine,
if the 4. <hi>houſe</hi> ſhall be a fixed ſigne, and the hurt (dammage) or loſſe
ſhall be more ſtrong or durable.</p>
            <p>And this is the ſcope of <hi>Bookers</hi> buſineſſe, and agrees <hi>verbatim</hi>
with the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he further ſaith, this (laſt) <hi>Aphoriſme agrees exactly with
the poſition of the Maglignant Planet Saturne in every reſpect:</hi>
Which is an apparent falſehood: For the <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> takes no
place, unleſſe <hi>Saturne</hi> were <hi>virtually</hi> in the <hi>Fourth houſe,</hi> which
he is not according to M. <hi>Lillys principles</hi> in this <hi>figure</hi> of his; Or
if he were, yet is it not in force, except (likewiſe) that <hi>Saturne</hi>
were found infortunate in the fourth houſe: Neither of which
he is, by his Poſition in <hi>Bookers figure,</hi> for (as I have formerly
demonſtrated) <hi>Saturne</hi> is the ſtrongeſt ſave one, of all the Planets
in the figure, having fifteene teſtimonies of ſtrength, whereby he
is very much fortified and powerfull.</p>
            <p>Now the genuine ſignification of <hi>Saturnes</hi> being <hi>Locally, virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
and <hi>fortunately</hi> placed in the 4. houſe, (as he now is in the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi>

I tell you (Jack) it hath been, and is ſtill likely (for the moſt part)

gain, and then you know (Jack) who muſt loſe: <hi>The Figure</hi> tels

&amp;c. before mentioned, in the influence of this Conjucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether it be for good or evill.</p>
            <p>For you to ſay, that in regard of the horrid murthers that have
been there committed upon the Proteſtants of that Kingdome, it
is likelyeſt to undergo the divine juſtice of God, more then the reſt;
it is no Aſtrologicall reaſon, nor (for ought you know) may ſome
of the other Kingdomes before named, be leſſe guilty of the ſame
ſinnes then <hi>Ireland:</hi> or deſerve a leſſe ſhare of the ill influence
of this Conjunction: I pray <hi>Iack,</hi> let you and I ſuſpend our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from intermedling, much more determining, things of that
nature. It is more proper for Divines then Aſtrologers.</p>
            <p>That which we ought to doe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to containe our ſelves within the

or Scots, have been the Authors of that Barbariſme, and bloud-ſhed
you mention: For he that will lay aſide paſſion, and private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:159928:16"/>
may find others beſides the Iriſh, as much, if not more
guilty of the bloud of thoſe many thouſands of Chriſtians, which
hath been ſhed ſince the beginning of that bloody Warre.</p>
            <p>But this is Wormwood to an <hi>Orange Scarfs</hi> and <hi>Feather:</hi> Yet
for their better ſatisfaction, I would adviſe them to peruſe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and judicious <hi>Philaerenus, Mercurius Hybernicale,</hi> and there
they ſhall have the naked truth clearely and impartially related:
I have been intimate with many of that Nation of ſeverall qualities,
yet could I never diſcover any more inherent cruelty or Barbariſme
in them, then in our ſelves, but for the moſt part, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap> them to
be men of ſingular good education, and naturally averſe to all inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.
The truth is, they hate to live in bondage, or to have their
conſciences enforced: and indeed, the ſetling religion by <hi>bloodſhed,</hi>
is none of the beſt State-policies: Such Divines as have tongues to
their conſciences will tell you ſo: or ought I know, every mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
ought to be dearer to him then his life, &amp; I know no reaſon
why the Iriſh may not challenge as much freedome and priviledge
in the enjoyment of their Religion, as is allowed the <hi>Independants,
Anabaptiſts, Browniſts,</hi> and at the leaſt a hundred more Sects, and
Schiſmes, within the Lines of Communication: who have liberty
without any reſtraint or limitation, to <hi>exerciſe their Gifts,</hi> (as they
terme it) both publiquely and privately: To preach and write
what they pleaſe, and even to cloy the Preſſe with their Hereſies,
and Schiſmes.</p>
            <p>And if wee looke back upon the originall ground of the Iriſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;
was it not high time (thinke you) for the Iriſh (after
they were denyed any reaſonable anſwer to their Propoſitions,
which were ſent and delivered in an humble and peaceable manner
to the Parliament, by Commiſſioners of that Kingdome, who
were diſmiſſed hence without any hopes of having their grievances
redreſſed, which (notwithſtanding) were farre greater, and more
intollerable, then thoſe which the <hi>Scots</hi> pretended: when they
clearely perceived ſo many pernicious Plots, &amp; damnable deſignes
dayly inventing againſt them, and with what Acrimony the <hi>Roman
Catholiques</hi> here were proceeded againſt after the third of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
1640. After ſo much ſwearing and forſwearing to take off
the Earle of <hi>Strafords</hi> head: And the Parliament electing a new
Deputy of their own mould, &amp; mettal, to be ſent over in his ſtead:
And his Majeſties Perſon in continuall hazard, by the frequent tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults

of the <hi>Sectariſts,</hi> and <hi>Schiſmatiques:</hi> was it not time (I ſay)
their Nation being thus neglected, and threatned, (his Majeſties
Perſon being not exempt from danger) and all this occaſioned by
their own fellow Subjects) to aſſociate and unite themſelves: and
to ſtand upon their guard, for the preſervation of their <hi>Religion,
Lives</hi> and <hi>liberties?</hi> And was it more <hi>Rebellion</hi> in them, by the
known Lawes of this or that Land, to raiſe Forces for the neceſſary
defence of their Kingdome: then in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> to raiſe
ſo many great Armies, that have fought againſt his Majeſty under
the pretence of fighting for him: whilſt yet there hath been no body
to oppoſe him, but themſelves? I remember a few verſes that were
written (by ſome body) <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. they reſemble the forme of a
Petition, directed to his Majeſty, by the conſiderate <hi>Catholiques</hi> of
<hi>Ireland:</hi> they are pretty ones, and therefore I will here give you
them, as I had them from a friend.</p>

advance for <hi>Italy:</hi> If they doe, they may doe well to tranſmit the

but I am afraid Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his courage will coole at the conceipt.
Nor is it pertinent to the handling of this <hi>Conjunction,</hi> for <hi>Booker</hi>
to tell us an old ſtory of the <hi>Spaniſh Armade in</hi> 88. or of the <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder

            <p>Or of what concernment is the Decollation of <hi>Mary,</hi> Queene
of <hi>Scots, Anno</hi> 1587. to the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe that
when ſhe was beheaded, <hi>Saturne</hi> was in <hi>Taurus,</hi> as now he is?</p>
            <p>Or of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> their being conjoyned in the yeere

Coaſt?</hi> Does not <hi>John Booker</hi> here moſt wretchedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
himſelfe? Inſtead of going about to prove <hi>Saturnes</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
through <hi>Taurus</hi> ominous to <hi>Ireland,</hi> he contrarily produces
examples, which prove that Poſition dangerous to <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland.</hi> For (what ever his meaning be) he inſtances not any
one thing hurtfull to <hi>Ireland</hi> in either of thoſe yeeres: And then
he robs Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> of more then a whole Page, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the generall Occurrences in the world, which happened
in 88. without any mention made of that <hi>moſt learned and judicious
Knight.</hi> And ſo he proceeds (to fill up the remainder of his mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Pamphlet) with railing at the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> telling them, how they
have ever been moſt <hi>rebellious</hi> and <hi>treacherous</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and have moſt barbarouſly and inhumanely murthered many
thouſand ſoules, &amp;c. But we know of another Kingdome that
hath ſometimes been more rebellious and treacherous then they,
for leſſe cauſe. But I never heard of any Soules that ever either of
them murthered. I ſpeak not this to juſtifie or maintaine any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
action in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or elſewhere, (for my nature abhors all
manner of cruelty to the worſt of men; I think I could not harme
either M. <hi>Lilly</hi> or <hi>Iohn Booker</hi> in word or deed, if I had them in my
power, but rather uſe them with all civill reſpect and curteſie, if
they were worſe then they be) nor to countenance <hi>Treaſon</hi> and
<hi>Rebellion:</hi> that I need not, it hath been ſufficiently done by a far
greater power. But the thing I aime at, is, to unmaske <hi>Bookers</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
hatred to that diſtreſſed Nation; who if he were but halfe
ſo charitable, as he is either unreaſonable, or ignorant, he would
not attempt to Aſſaſſine the <hi>Honour</hi> of a whole <hi>Nation,</hi> with his
invectives, but rather ſuſpend theſe his raſh cenſures, and wiſh a
happy union, then the confuſion of ſo many Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The remainder of his Pamphlet tends to the defence of <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logis,</hi>
(wherein he ſtill playes the thiefe with Sir <hi>Chr: Heydon)</hi>
and of the Planet <hi>Venus</hi> her appearance in the day time, at the birth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:159928:18"/>
of our moſt hopefull Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> which he ſaith (if ſhe preſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
any thing) was the miſeries of this Kingdome: Becauſe
(ſaith he) it is uſuall, and an ordinary thing, for <hi>Venus</hi> to be ſeene
in the day time. I grant him, that it is both uſuall, and ordinary;
but not alwayes at the birth of <hi>Princes.</hi> It is both uſuall and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
for <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> to be in <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and ſhall wee
therefore ſay it preſignifies nothing? I confeſſe I have not ſeene
any Authors that handle ſuch Appearances, nor hath <hi>Booker</hi> any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Authority, then his fooliſh Phancy, for ſaying ſhe was the
<hi>Prodromus</hi> of theſe unhappy differences in <hi>England:</hi> But he that

You ſee Sir, the Regall Signe <hi>Leo</hi> culminates, the <hi>Sun,</hi> who is
<hi>Lord</hi> thereof, and <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> are in the ninth houſe of the
Figure, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> poſſeſſeth the <hi>mid-heaven.</hi> The Conjunction
happens in the eleventh deg. and eight min. of <hi>Gemini,</hi> (the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen.
of <hi>London)</hi> and in the eight houſe, which is the houſe of <hi>death,
labours, ſadnes,</hi> and <hi>heritage of dead men:</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> is Lord of the
Aſcend. for the 3. deg. and 29. min. of <hi>Scorpio</hi> aſcends at the time
of this meeting: And he likewiſe diſpoſeth of the ſecond Houſe,
where the <hi>Dragons taile</hi> alſo miſerably afflicteth: I ſhall leave
the judgement to <hi>Iohn Booker:</hi> only I ſhall tell him thus much,
that I thinke the <hi>Cavaliers will (by this time) challenge a better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
from the City of London, then now they dare, and perhaps enjoy
their own without Compoſition.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more, but conclude
with an Application of that pertinent and pious complaint of the
<hi>Acquitaines,</hi> (occaſioned upon the Depoſing of King <hi>Richard</hi> the
ſecond) to the preſent condition of this wretched Kingdome.
<q>O good God! Where is the world become? Saints are turned
to Serpents, and Doves into Devils: The <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi>
which hath been accompted fierce, only againſt their Foes,
and alwaies faithfull to their Friends, are now become both
fierce and faithleſſe againſt their lawfull and loving Prince,
and have moſt barbarouſly betrayed him. Who would ever
have thought that Chriſtians, that civill People, that any
men would thus have violated all Religion, all Lawes, and
all honeſt and civill demeanor? And although the Heavens
bluſh at the view, and the earth ſweats at the burthen of ſo
vile a villany, and all men proclaime, and exclaime upon
ſhame and confuſion againſt them; yet they neither feel the
horror, nor ſhrinke at the ſhame, nor feare the revenge; but
ſtand upon termes, ſome of defence for the lawfulnes of their
dealing, and ſome of excuſe for the neceſſity. Well, let them
be able to blind the world, and to reſiſt mans revenge; yet ſhal
they never be able to eſcape either the fight, or vengeance
of Almighty God, which wee dayly expect, and earneſtly
deſire to be powred upon them: Alas good King <hi>Charles,</hi>
thy nature was too gentle, and thy government too mild for
ſo ſtiffe and ſtubborne a People: what <hi>King</hi> will ever repoſe
any truſt in ſuch <hi>unnaturall-Subjects,</hi> but fetter them with
Lawes, as Theeves are with Irons? What carriage hereafter
