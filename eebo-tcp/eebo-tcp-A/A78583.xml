         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap> and ſignifies a vain Dreamer, Enthuſiaſt, or Brain-ſick Viſioniſt, one who by natural diſtemper, or ſpiritual infatuation, or both, is deluded and would delude other's by the pretenſe of Revelations, and New Lights, never, content with common Experience, univerſal Conſent, or plain Demonſtration.</p>

               <p>NOw the occaſion of this word ſeems to be this. At a general Council for the regulating of affairs in Church and State, all Complaints tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the matters in hand were to be received and debated: but there being alwayes in the World of Men more or leſs that ſpirit of Pride, Self-conceit and Diſcontent, the unreaſonable clamours of giddy perſons would have ſo filled the Aſſembly, that nothing of concernment could have been taken into conſideration, had they not ſtill kept ſuch a <hi>Decorum,</hi> as that nothing might be admitted but what upon Examination of a ſelect company was found to be of weighty conſequence: whereupon thoſe impertinent troublers, and buſie, male-contents who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, received the moſt pertinent denomination of <hi>Phanatiques;</hi> and ſo it hath been in all ages a diſtinctive term, whereby thoſe who kick againſt the preſent conſtitution of a regulated Church and State have been diſtinguiſht from the ſober part of a Nation, who ſubmit to, all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and fundamental Laws and Conſtitutions: but eſpecially thoſe religious irreligious mad-men-Hereticks, being parallel to the <hi>Seditions</hi> of the Citie of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> in its <hi>Destruction.</hi>

               <p>TO particularize the ſeveral ſorts of Phanatiques would be the work rather of a Volume than a Sheet; but in ſhort, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe may be truly called <hi>Phanatiques,</hi> who depend more upon the dictates of their own corrupt imaginations, and phantaſies of their diſtempered brain than reaſon, cuſtom, experience, or the general conſent of all ages and nations; but eſpecially thoſe who prefer their pretended inſpirations and new lights before the revealed Will of God in the Scriptures. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe who like the Jews will not be content unleſs Chriſt will ſubmit to their dirty humours, and come live upon earth with them, and ſo order the matter for them, that they, and they only, may poſſeſſe the earth, and will by no means be perſwaded to ſubmit to any authority but His, whoſe Kingdom is not of this world. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All thoſe, who out of an ambitious itch to appear ſomebody, under what pretenſes ſoever, endeavour to ſubvert all order and diſcipline both in Church and State, by oppoſing every power, not reſpecting Right, Law, Reaſon, true Religion, or the publick good, wherein their own is included, were they but ſo ſober as to be ſenſible of it.</p>

               <head>THE CHARACTER.</head>
               <p>A <hi>PHanatique</hi> is the Muſhrom of diſtemper, a falſe Conception gotten by the Air upon the ſick womb of a confuſed phancy, a meer change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who devours greedily all doctrines, but receives nouriſhment from none; the diſhonour of his reputed father, the plague and ruine of his miſerable mother; he is a reaſonable creature uncapable of the right uſe of reaſon. He is a certain thing that would puzzle <hi>Plats</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to define, and indeed no man knowes well what he is, but himſelf leaſt of all. You may better expreſſe him in the Negative than the Affirmative; for he is neither Pagan, Turk, Jew, nor true Chriſtian. But to come as cloſe to him as we can, he is a confuſed lump of earth not refined, ſtill retaining the habit of that <hi>Chaos</hi> from whence he firſt proceeded, and is like a beggars bag fill'd with ſcraps of all ſorts of food, or like a Botchers cuſhion made up of the various kinds of Shreds and patches, which he hath filched from ſeveral garments. He is of a ſceptical humour, and you may ſooner pick all Religions out of him than one: and is ſomewhat a kin to all profeſſions different from his own, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries moſt from the Orthodox Proteſtant. So that a right phanatique is a phantaſtick fellow, pleaſing himſelf with new fangles, and continually gaping after Novelties, and the diſcovery of New lights. He forſakes the true fire, and runs over bogs and mooriſh places to light his torch at an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> and (ten to one but) he ſinks in the purſuit of it, and is never able to return again. He is fit for neither Heaven, Earth, nor yet Hell, becauſe he is againſt all order and government, which is not only exerciſed in Heaven and Earth, but practiſed by the Devils themſelves. He pretends much to a good conſcience, yet thinks it lawful to murder all that diſſent from him in opinion, although he changes from himſelf more often than the Moon. If you talk with him to day you are never the nearer to know him to morrow, for you ſhall finde him perfectly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſed. He rayls much againſt the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when none ſo much reſemble the beaſt as himſelf, whoſe mark he bears in his fore-head, but wants the Looking-glaſs of reaſon to deſcern it. He writes all men in the black book of Reprobation, but his own fraternity, and concludes all his Fore-fathers damned. He thinks himſelf wiſer than all others, although he be a verier fool than a meer Naturaliſt. He will prate two hours together, and after all you may ſooner reſolve a <hi>Delphian</hi> Oracle, than unfold his meaning, only he is dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous in blaſpheming thoſe two great Ordinances of God, Magiſtracy and Miniſtry. He is naturally an arrand Coward, yet his Chymerical opinions infuſe into him a kinde of frenetique valour. He is a perfect Saint in his own conceit, and would not change places in Heaven with any of the Apoſtles whom he calls nothing but bare <hi>Paul; Peter, John, &amp;c.</hi> and dare not add the title of Saint for fear of ſinning. He hath but a mean reſpect to the Scripture, and could, wiſh ſome things expunged out of the Bible, having blotted them out of his minde and opinion, which is all one as to curtel the Scriputre. And for Tradition he cannot abide it, eſteeming of the writings of ancient Fathers as Winter-tales, or old Womens fables: If he be not an enemy to Government in the abſtract, he is rarely reconcileable to preſent powers, (in caſe they do not ſhowre preſerments upon him) for that he thirſts after innovation as well in things Civil as Eccleſiaſtical. And loathes Antiquity as a French-man does his faſhions of the laſt year. He is by nature covetous, yet will not grudge to ſquander away his whole eſtate to maintain Conventicles, and is charitable to none but his own tribe. The Proverbs of <hi>Solomon</hi> are a great eye-ſore thim, but eſpecially that Text, <hi>My ſon, fear God and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change.</hi> To conclude, He is a bubble or bladder toſſed to and fro with every winde, which, at length breaks, and vaniſheth to nothing.</p>
