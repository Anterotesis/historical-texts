            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THat way which seduceth poor Souls from the great Rule God hath given to live by and be saved, is not to be tolerated (shall we allow them among us who take away from <hi>Immortal</hi> Souls all the sure foundation they have against the time to come? shall we endure them among us whose business it is to hide the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal counsel of God from men.) Popery doth seduce poor Souls from the great Rule of life. Papistis, (and shall they be tolerated) make it part of their Religion to perswade us that we should not search the Scripture, wherein we may have life? Catholicks (and shall they be Indulgent?) make it their business to keep us from the holy <hi>Sriptures which are able</hi> to make us wise unto salvation, perfect and thoughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished unto all good works: they of <hi>Rome</hi> (and shall they be connived at) draw poor Souls from the word of God <hi>that is able to build us up and to give us an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them that are sanctified</hi>: they (said that there should be such among us) endeavour that we should not <hi>prove what is the good, the perfect, the acceptable will of our God:</hi> that without knowledge of this will the people
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62999:6"/>
                  <hi>should perish</hi>: they (and what can Satan do more?) disuade poor Souls from reading the Scriptures: they persuade them that the Scriptures ought to be in an unknown Tongue; that hearing poor Souls might hear and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the things that belong to their peace, must we needs have these among us that may persuade people too much inclined of themselves to sit in ignorance among us who (after all our pains to instruct an ignorant world) now persuade poor souls to be still alienated from the life of God, to have their understanding still darkened to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain still the blindnesse of their hearts? and can the enemy of mankind do any more: shall we have those in the midst of us (who notwithstanding all our endeavours to teach the world a saving knowledge of God) shall yet (and alas! the <hi>murderer from</hi> the beginning desires no more) persuade mankind that it is a vein thing to be filled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods will in all wisdom and <hi>spiritual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>: no Christian state can Tolerate those people whose Religion is to keep the world in ignorance of all Religion, who know we must love God, yet will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to know him; who know we must obey him, yet wil not suffer us to know his will.</p>

                  <p>For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.</p>
                  <p>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues:</p>
                  <p>For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembred her iniquities.</p>

Look on the consecrated bread and Wine, touch it, smell it, taste it, and if thou canst but be sure that it is indeed Bread and Wine thou maist be as sure that Popery is a delusion.

What you think seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is the greatest mercy; what you call cruelty, is the greatest kindness in the world, as being a kindness to souls, and that for Eternity.—</p>

you may very well afford towards the security of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which you so much hazard. Is it persecution to allow something of your superfluities for the Kings necessities? especially when it is not so much as the Pope extorted from you, when he called <hi>England, Puteus inexhaustus.</hi>—You pay nothing now for Bulls, Pardons, Licenses, Dirges obits,—Vestments, Crosses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You may have a cheap way of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God: and therefore I hope you may afford his Majesty the more that he may maintain that way.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Should not be persecuted:</hi>—You are not persecuted for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but punished for disobedience.—You say you disobey for conscience sake:—be that between God and you:—the Magistrates observe your actions, and punish them; your hearts they know not, and therefore they judge them not.—There is no governing of Mankind, if the Magistrate must not punish mens actions which he seeth, but indulge them for their conscience which he seeth not.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Should not be persecuted:</hi>—You are not persecuted, but onely disabled from persecuting us: you are weakned in your Estates onely, that you may not ruine us: you are uncapable of power, that you may not oppress us: to live quietly, sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and honestly, you have enough; to live seditiously, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously and factiously, you have too much. We are so indulgent to you, that you want nothing which may be necessary for your livelyhood, though we are so jealous over you that you want that which may be necessary for your designe: we take away part of your Estates, that you may not be capable of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting that whereby you may forfeit the whole.—</p>
               <p>Here I observe two Rules: 1. The one of Charity; <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to do to others what we would not have done to our selves:</hi> where we must distinguish what we <hi>would not in reason,</hi> and what we <hi>would not in interest:</hi> If I were a malefactor in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, I would not be punisht; if I were a Judge in reason, I would punish a malefactor: so if I were in an errour, self-love would distaste to me a desire of advancing my errour.—If I held the truth contrary to that errour, conscience would sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest to me my duty to suppress that for the advancement of a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62999:18"/>
truth; to the case in hand, if you should really think we were deceived and went astray, we would have you by all means discover to us the errours of our waies, and restrain us from them; and now we really think you in damnable errors, we would convince you of those errors; and by all means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain you from them. 2. The other rule is of prudence; teaching to bear with you the lesser inconveniences as coming neerest to us, that we may be able to suppress other factions that go farthest from us: 1. Of two inconveniences we may chuse the least; but of two sins we may chuse none,—and really I think it sin in me to countenance any thing in which I judge against Gods truth and way;—if I can discountenance it. 2. To bear with you is to bear wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. <hi>Reason,</hi> As to what you say of commerce and marriage, we establish not our religion upon policie, but upon piety—we look not what is most advantagious, but what is most law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: although yet it be the interest of forreigners as much to be of our Religion, as it is ours to be of theirs—the <hi>English</hi> peace and trade is as much their advantage, as theirs is ours: as for the Earl of <hi>Bristow,</hi> he told King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> that for which he was questioned by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in Parliament: As for the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> he did a little regard <hi>Richleau,</hi> as he did him:—and he hath lived to see as great a Cardinal court the <hi>English,</hi> when resolute in their way, though never so severe to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques—their resolute <hi>are fooled, the resolved</hi> are feared:—as for the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> if we had followed Her interest, she might have been the greatest Queen in <hi>Europe</hi>;—and the Lord would have let the World have seen—that it was the highest advantage in the World to give up our selves and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God and the <hi>Gospel:</hi> as for English Queens we may in time have Protestant Queens. In the mean time we know our gracious Queens will not impose upon us the publick practice or indulgence at least of their Religion no more, then we impose our Religion upon them: they had rather few then whole Kingdoms should suffer, they had rather see you suffer for your conscience, then force us to allow your way against our consciences; however to avoid some <hi>supposed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,</hi> we will not commit sin which is a <hi>real,</hi> and the <hi>greatest inconvenience</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>To your eighth, ninth and tenth Reason: we say, if you are

true to the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy, you cannot be true to the <hi>Kings</hi> Government:—if you deny that, (as you seem to do) you deny the foundation of your Religion, yea, the sum of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith.

If you did not go to Forreigners for Religion, you need not go to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners for Protection: if you will worship with them, you may live with them. 3. If you keep correspondence with our enemies, and practise against us, when you are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of punishment; what will you do when you are tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? If you deal with Forreigners now, <hi>to secure your selves from us</hi>; much more will you deal with them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that you may have <hi>power over us:</hi> what you do now for <hi>liberty,</hi> you will do hereafter for <hi>power:</hi> this threatning insinuation will signifie little with us, who measure our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by our Consciences, and not by Interest; whatever inconvenience follows upon your punishment, we will not displease God to tolerate you.</p>
               <p>To your twelfth Reason, we can say upon sad experience that you may do more harm by creeping into houses, then we can do good by preaching in Congregations.</p>

you, if they cannot make their perswasions eminent in converting you; and that when they are the severest enemies to your corruptions, they are the most hearty well-wishers to your persons, and you may hear them as such.—</p>
               <p>Sirs, As you did your duty in serving the King in his just War, so he will allow you all just priviledge in time of peace: but you must not think that the reward of your obedience to him in some things, shall be a liberty to disobey him in other. Although we have been (as you say) <hi>fellow sufferers with you,</hi> we will not sin with you. You say, you hazarded much to restore the King to his Throne: To what purpose, I pray you, if every man shall do what is good in his own eyes, <hi>as when there was no King in Israel?</hi> And you must know, his sacred Majestie makes Laws against you, not to satisfie any mans pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or revenge, but to satisfie his own conscience.</p>
               <p>Whereas you speak of his Majesties mercie, and word from <hi>Breda:</hi>—1. Let me tell you, <hi>That Toleration would be the greatest cruelty in the world.—</hi> 2. You know his Majestie promised no more at <hi>Breda, but that he should condescend to such provisions for tender Consciences as his Parliament would think fit.</hi>

               <p>And that you may know that this is not an Act of <hi>power</hi> but—of <hi>reason,</hi> not what they think they may, but what they think they <hi>ought,</hi> you have added their reason too—Ordering.</p>
