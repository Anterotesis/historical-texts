            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>But Gentlemen, and you now appointed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44134:26"/>
to be my Judges, I deny that my name is <hi>Envy-good,</hi> and if your Honours shall please to send for any that do intimately know me, or for the Midwife that laid my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of me, or for the Gossips that was at my Christning, they will any, or all of them, prove that my name is not <hi>Envy-good.</hi> Wherefore I cannot plead to this Indictment, for as much as my name is not incerted therein, and as is my true name, so also are my conditions. I was always a man that loved to live at quiet, and what I loved my self, that I thought others might love also. Wherefore when I saw any of my Neighbours to labour under a disquieted mind, I endeavoured to help them what I could, and instances of this good temper of mine, many I could give: As</p>
               </sp>
               <p>First, When ever I saw any to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted in <hi>Vtopia,</hi> I presently sought out means to get them quiet again</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the ways of the old World, and of <hi>Sodom,</hi> were in fashion; if any thing happened to molest those that were for the customs of those times, I laboured to make them quiet again, and to cause them to act without molestation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To come nearer home, if in <hi>Vtopia</hi> I saw any troubled for sin, I endeavoured
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44134:27"/>
by someway, device, invention or other, to labour to bring them to peace again.</p>
               <sp>
                  <p>Wherefore, since I have been always a man of so vertuous a temper, as some say a peace-maker is, and if a peace-maker be so deserving a man, as some have been bold to attest he is, then let me, Gentlemen, be accounted by you, who have a great name for Justice and Equity, for a man that deserveth not this inhumane way of treatment, but liberty, and also a licence to seek damage of those that have been my accusers.</p>

                  <p>Cryer, <hi>O Yes, for as much as the Prisoner at the Bar hath denied his name to be that which is mentioned in the Indictment, the</hi> Court <hi>requireth that if there be any in this place, that can give information to the</hi> Court <hi>of the orginal and right name of the Prisoner, they would come forth and give in their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the Prisoner stands upon his own innocency.</hi>

               <sp>
                  <p>Then came two into the Court and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired that they might have leave to speak what they knew concerning the Prisoner at the Bar: The name of the one was <hi>Find-right,</hi> and the name of the other <hi>Tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth</hi>; so the Court demanded of these

men, if they knew the Prisoner, and what they could say concerning him, for he stands, said they, upon his own Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

                     <p>Now Mr. <hi>Currior,</hi> to your Cozenage; you cannot be content only to burn the Leather you dress, for fault of Liquor, because you would make the Shoomaker pay well, and you put in little stuff; and beside, when as in Backs you should only put in Tallow hard and good, you put in soft Kitchin stuff mixt, and so make the good and well tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Leather by your Villany, to fleet and waste away, but also you grow to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting Knave and a Forestaller of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; for you will buy Leather, Sides, Backs and Calve Skins, and sell them to the poor Shoomakers at an unreasonable rate, by your false retailing, getting infinite goods by that excessive price; both undoing the poor Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44134:59"/>
and causing us, that we pay extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Shoes. For if the Currier bought not Leather by the whole of the Tanner, the Shoomaker might have it at a more reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able price; but the Shoemaker being poor, is not perhaps able to deal with a dicker of Hides, nor perhaps with a couple of Backs, and the Tanner will not trust him; then the extorting and couzening Currier comes up with this, I will lend you for a day; and so pincheth him, that he is scarce able to find his Children bread. But well hath his Majesty provided by an Act of Parliament, That no Currier shall buy Leather, either Backs or Hides of the Tanner, so to bridle the extorting and forestalling Couzenage; but craftilier and subtilier hath the Knave <hi>Currier</hi> cros-bitten the Statute, in that he deals thus with the Tanner, he makes him hold his Leather unreasonably to the Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker; and so when he cannot sell it, he lays it up in the <hi>Curriers</hi> house, under a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, whereas indeed he hath sold it him. Suppose this shift be spied and prevented, then compoundeth he with some Knave Shoemaker, some base Rakehell without a Conscience, that neither respecteth God, the Common-wealth, nor his Company, and forsooth he is half with the <hi>Currier,</hi> who letteth him have some hundred Marks

to lay out for Leather every Month, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he spends not in his Shop a hundred Marks worth in a year; so the Shoemaker buys it to abuse the Statute, for the Curri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Currier by that means undoeth the other Shoemakers: thus two crafty Knaves are met, and they need no honest Broker.</p>

the Jury. The one said he was a Grasier, the other a Farmer, the other a Shepherd to them both. What think you of these three, quoth Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>? Marry, saith the Judge, two of them are honest men, but the other is a base Knave; but 'tis no matter, shuffle him in amongst the rest. Nay, by your leave, quoth Mr. Attorney, I will shuffle out these two, for they are the very Cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of the Countrey, and devour the poor people with their monstrous exaction.</p>

After him followed two Boys in Cloaks like Butterflies, carrying one of them his cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sword of Choler, the other his dancing Rapier of delight.

and the gowned Brother seemed by their pace, as if they had some Suits to Mosieur <hi>Boots.</hi> At length coming near, Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> could discern the first to be a Poet, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a Player, the third a Musitian, <hi>alias</hi> the Usher of a Dancing-School. Well met, Master Poet, quoth Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> and welcom you Friends also, though not so particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known. So it is, though none of you three be Common-wealths men, yet upon urgent necessity, we must be forced to employ you. We have a Jury to be impannelled im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, which one of you three must help to make up, even he which approves himself the honestest man. They are all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men, and good Fellows, quoth the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, therefore it is no great matter whether of them we chuse.</p>

                     <p>This first, whom by his careless slovenly gate, at first sight I imagined to be a Poet, is a wast-good, and an unthrift, that is born to make the Taverns rich, and himself a Beggar. If he have forty pounds in his purse together, he puts it not to Usury, neither
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44134:80"/>
buyes Land nor Merchandise with it, but goes to Wenches feeds on Capons, and spends ten Pounds on a Supper. Why, 'tis nothing, if his Plough goes, and his Ink-horn be clear. Take one of them worth twenty thousand pound, and hang him. He is a King of his Pleasure, and counts all other Boors and Peasants; that though they have Money at command, yet know not like him how to domineer with it to any purpose as they should. But to speak plain, I think him an honest man, if he would but live within his compass, and generally no mans foe but his own, therefore I hold him quoth the Prisoner, sit to be of my Jury. Nay, quoth the Judge, I have more mind to these two; for this Poet is a proud fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that because he hath a little wit in his Budget, will contemn and mislike that which is Reason and Sence, and think we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to him, if he do but bestow a fair Look upon us.</p>

                  <p>The Player and the Usher of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing School are plain, honest, humble men that for a penny, or an old cast Suit of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel, will do any thing. Quoth, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder, you say Truth, they are but too humble; for they be so lowly, that they be base-minded; I mean, not in their looks, nor apparrel, for so they be Peacocks, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Asses, but in their course of Life: for they care not how they get crowns, I mean, how basely, so they have them; and yet of the two, I hold the Player to be the better Christian, although he is in his own imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, too full of self-liking, and self-love, and is unsit to be of the Jury though

conceal his faults &amp; fopperies, in that I have been merry at his Sports, only this I must say, that plain Countrey Fellows they bring in as Clowns and Fools to laugh at in their Play, whereas they get by us, and of our Alms the proudest of them all doth live. Well, to be brief, let him trot to the Stage, for he shall be none of the Jury: And so you, Mr. Usher of the Dancing-School, you are a leader into all Misrule, you instruct Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to order their feet, when you drive them to misorder their Manners; you are a bad fellow, that stand upon your Tricks and Capers, till you make young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men caper without your Lands. Why Sir, to be flat with you, you live by your Legs, ass Jugler by his hand; you are given over to the Pomps and Vanities of the world. And to be short, you are a keeper of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule, and a lewd fellow, and you shall be none of the Quest. Why then, quoth the Judg, the Poet is he that must make up the four and twentieth; He and none but he.</p>
