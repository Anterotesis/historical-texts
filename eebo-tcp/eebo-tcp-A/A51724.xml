            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HEY that make a
question whether it
be true or no that
God speakes any
more to men, or indeed that
men have any more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
from God; let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it for a certaine that hee
speakes, but they are too deafe
to heare the language; let them
beleeve it for certaine that hee
writes, but they are too blinde
to perceive the Character: Hee
that will understand his voyce,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105632:4"/>
hee that will read his letter, let
him betake himselfe to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
writ, that is a Vocabulary,
which the Spirit of God hath
left us to explaine his profound
discourses by, that is a key to
disclose all those obscure letters
that are directed to us from
heaven.</p>
            <p>Will you, O Princes, will you,
O people, conceive what it is
that God speakes when hee
sends a pestilence, when hee
sends a famine, when hee sends
warre, when hee brings estates
to destruction, or in hazard to
be destroyed? Goe runne over
these names in the Vocabulary
of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>But the weake and weary eyes
of our mind eschew the light of
the truth, they precipitate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into an abysse of miseries,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105632:4"/>
and among the obscurities of
the night grope for the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the sunne: Thus wee
renounce the prerogatives of
the new law.</p>
            <p>It is not the way to get forth
of the Clouds in which the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
walked, for men, but to
change them. Those divine
mysteries which they beheld
only clouded up in darknesse,
are now most transparently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in a cleare skie; yet the
causes of the Revolutions of
States, of the increase of one, of
the diminution of another, of
the fall of Princes, of Famine,
of Pestilence, of Warre, were
openly displayed to them, and
wee on the contrary envelop
them in the obscuritie of a
thousand ambiguities, as if that
were not true which the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105632:5"/>
Divines have told us, that
the Chastisements which came
upon the Israelites befell them
for our example.</p>
            <p>God speaketh but once (saith
<hi>Iob)</hi> and speaketh not againe:
the holy writ is that booke in
which hee hath spoken: there
then ought to be searched the
causes of good or bad events,
where clearly and for our sakes
they are written.</p>
            <p>To frame Politicke apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismes,
to set downe rules for it
taken from prophane authors,
is in a manner to pretend that
mans will is necessarie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing.</p>
            <p>Nay I could find in my heart
to say that it is an undeifying
of God, and a deifying of the
second causes: He makes them
serve his turne, but them hee
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105632:5"/>
serves not. Hee that in discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upon naturall events
brings in God only for a reason,
is but a poore Philosopher; and
hee that brings him not in, in
Inquiries of Politick occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
is but a poore Christian;
when it is his pleasure that the
fire which at one time scorched
should at another coole,<note place="margin">Vid. Da<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note> hee
must have recourse to his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
power in working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
but hee may very well
without miracles give way,
that the same action which at
one time hath reared up a
Prince, should at another sink
him.</p>
            <p>Our too leaden wings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eagle us up from this base
earth, wee walke in a gloomy
aire, without lifting up our
eyes to that most glorious
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105632:6"/>
Sunne of the Empireum.</p>
            <p>The Politick treatises of the
Gentiles which are but earthly,
bring us back to earth, in that
they have in them but earthly
causes, but the holy instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which are sent us from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
producing heavenly causes,
bring us home to heaven. O most
benigne Lord, may it please
thee to give to drink of thy
most cleare and living water,
this thirsty wretch who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes
the stinking and muddy
Cisternes of the Gentiles, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loathing them than satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them.</p>
            <p>If I knew not my selfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to bee taken out of the
darknesse of my grosse igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
I would most humbly
and upon my knees intreat thee
for one ray which like the daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105632:6"/>
leading mee on to the
most cleare Noone, might at
this present in some part draw
mee out of the obscuritie of
this dimme night, that I might
discover those deepe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
mysteries which are
concealed from the feeblenesse
of our understandings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Prophet Samuel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
Saul, because
that contrarie to Gods
commandement, hee had
left Agag King of the
Amalekites alive, and had
not slaine all his cattell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe disobedience of <hi>Saul</hi>
gives the last turne to the
wheele of his greatnesse: It is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105632:7"/>
a fire which consumeth crowns,
for they are soldred with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
He knoweth not what
belongs to matter of state that
loseth this towards God: hee
teacheth others to forgoe it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
their superiours, and as
much as in him lyes, destroyes
the compacture of the universe.</p>
            <p>Disobedience is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
either of the arrogance
of the braine, or of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the senses; either that
men thinke to doe better than
they are commanded, or that
they are inclined to doe worse;
In one of these the frailtie
sometimes meets with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
in the other the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
alwaies provokes to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance:
This can never bee in
regard of God, because it is not
possible to bee wiser than God,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105632:7"/>
and when it is practised among
men, although it may often
seeme to produce good fruit,
yet is it alwayes naught, as that
which proceeds from an evill
plant. Well ordered Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
have not forborne
to punish it, though prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
victories ill disciplined
bringing with them more dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
than defeatments doe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul excuses himselfe in that
the people had preserved
the best of the spoile to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
them to God:
Obedience is better than
Sacrifice (answers Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOd had already ordained
the Sacrifice when he had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105632:8"/>
commanded that all the men,
and all the Cattell of the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites
should be slaine; so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Priests they were, that
were appointed to kill them, so
many sacrifices as to bee killed.</p>
            <p>There want not this day
such <hi>Sauls,</hi> that sacrifice to
God the sacrifices of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
These golden moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
heaped up with impiety
that seemes sometimes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne
them, defile the altars
of God, they onely garnish the
ambition of man: Hee that
thinks with these to pacifie his
divine Majestie, incenseth it:
as much as in him lyes, with
execrable blasphemie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes
that Majestie to bee
most wicked, and makes him
partaker of his misdeeds, as if
hee were bound to bee appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105632:8"/>
with him, so hee may but
have a share in the purchases of
his villanies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Prophet replies, Because
thou hast rejected the
word of the Lord, the Lord
bath rejected thee from
being King. Saul sayes to
him, I have sinned, return
with mee that I may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SEe the power of ambition,
which hath oftentimes
more force upon the hearts of
men than the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God have: He makes
as if he repented, because hee
feares to lose the Kingdome:
Hee repents not because hee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105632:9"/>
cares not for losing Heaven
But (Oh the deceivable judge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments
of men) because hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
not, hee loseth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven; when hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
had hee repented, hee had
lost neither the kingdome nor
heaven.</p>
            <p>Hee that will learne the best
art for preserving of states, let
him read the decalogue, he shall
find there in ten lines dictated
by the holy Ghost, those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
that are the most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
for the achieving of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the least deceitfull for
soveraigntie upon earth: Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
is a Sea so inconstant, so tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent,
that there is no place
to bee found in it where wee
have not seene one Prince or
other cast away, it is a peece of
Architecture so decayed, that it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105632:9"/>
alwayes threatneth to fall
downe, that to keepe the
frame of the world upon its
basis, God, that heaven and
earth may not be confounded,
permits it still to bee tottering,
yet sometimes under those that
observe his owne precepts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel offers to depart; Saul
takes him by the skirt of
his garment and teares it:
Even so shall the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Israel bee rent
from thee, addeth the
Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOe not (Oh yee Princes)
spoile your subjects; Let
the vestments of the Priests be
sacred in your eyes: Hee that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105632:10"/>
spoileth the subject is not a
Prince; hee is a Tyrant: hee
loseth the name if hee lose
not the estate.</p>
            <p>God hath many times made
garments expresse his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
peradventure because
they are in some sort a part of
our selves while they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to us. The spirits which
continually exhale out of our
bodies, are those that cause this

            <p>The Coats of beasts are very
certaine signes of their nature,
as the Garments of men are of
their conceit, for as that appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells
the one kind, so the other
doth the other. Every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
hath its difference of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
because each hath its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of conceit, which hath
not a cloathing of her owne,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105632:10"/>
hath not a Prince of her owne:
Against such a one peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
one of the Prophets ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
in threatning tearmes
when hee said, Woe be to you
which goe clad in strange gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
It may goe for a kind
of a sure token, that if they have
not a stranger to theri Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
they would have one. A
horses coat shewes his constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a mans his inclination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul answereth that he hath
sinned, yet prayes the
Prophet againe to returne
with him to the sacrifice,
and to honour him before
the Elders of the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO leape from Religion
to Hypocrisie, to offend
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105632:11"/>
and therewith to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
is not to serve God, but to
make God serve his turne, and
when one cannot deceive him,
to deceive others by him. The
cause of so great an impietie is
that execrable proposition ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enough deplored, That tis
all one, to bee good, and to
seeme good. This may bee true
in regard of men whose know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is but opinion.</p>
            <p>No sooner was <hi>Saul</hi> made
acquainted with the will of
God, but hee seeks how to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it; no sooner leaves hee to
bee religious, but hee becomes
a Politician; as if the cunning
of state which is not sufficient
to defend us against men, were
able to defend us against God.</p>
            <p>The certaine knowledge that
a Prince is to lose his estate,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105632:11"/>
raises up many to looke after
it. There is no fearing of him
whose fortunes the heavens
oppose, and men are very glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
instruments of Gods anger.
If men were among us as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to remunerate the good as
they are to chastise the bad,
and rewards were equall to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
peradventure the
world would bee better than it
is: but because punishment
many times is accompanied
with profit, and Reward with
some losse, men are more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to punish than to reward:
And it is very convenient that
in this world the Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
should be greater than
the Rewards, to make us know
that in the other the Rewards
shall be greater than the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements.</p>

               <hi>Samuel had said that hee
would not returne, yet
hee returneth afterward,
though not to sacrifice with
Saul, yet to sacrifice A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag,
not as Minister of
Hypocrisie, or of Policie,
but of Religion: Hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Agag to bee brought
before him, that he might
slay him. Hee considers
in him the Image of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
waxen fat with the
blood and substance of his
subjects, and trembling
at the anger of God. The
Prophet saith unto him;
As thy sword hath
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105632:12"/>made many women
childlesse, so shall thy
mother be made child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
among women,
and so hee killeth him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>KNow you why the Lord
said, <hi>Hee that striketh
with the sword, shall perish with
the sword?</hi> To adde force to the
law of nature, that saith, Doe
not that to another which thou
wouldst not have done to thee:
but little would this, if God had
not added; for that which thou
dost to another shall be done to
thee: the one doth instruct,
and the other terrifie us. If God
should not sometimes punish
sins in this world, they would
not beleeve that there is a God;
if he should alwaies punish sins
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105632:13"/>
in this world, men would think
there were no other world for
them but this.</p>

               <hi>Samuel departeth to Ramah,

            </p>
            <p>PRinces may well thinke it
is no shame to remove
those from their charge, that
carry themselves shamefully
therein: yet need they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that false rule of policy,
that to change their Ministers
before their time is to submit
themselves to their subjects, to
accustome them to dislike of
their Governours, and a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
thing to their dominion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105632:13"/>
in permitting them not to have
the election, yet at least the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of his Ministers, who
may thereby bee more apt to
prefer the appetite of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
before the service of the
Prince. The malignitie of men
hath mistaken the termes, this
is not to give way to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
'tis but to give them eare.
It is no losse of authoritie, but a
purchase, and it shall never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome
the subjects to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of such officers which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
well, to take away those
who deserve ill.</p>
            <p>Man who is moulded of base
matter attributeth to himselfe
more oftentimes than to God;
who though hee can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
yet having chosen a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
who turneth to evill, doth
speake and worke as if hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105632:14"/>
And man who on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>
               <hi>The lamentations of Samuel

            </p>
            <p>HOw oft doth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
offer sacrifice for the
sinner, whiles the sinner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
is sacrificing to the Devill?
whiles the one labours to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
God, the other provoketh
him farther. It might seeme
unto God that the righteous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor
were a liar in craving
pardon for him that refuseth it,
if God did not know that the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105632:14"/>
sinner is like to a mad man, who
oft hath need of one of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to speake to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician

            <p>God in some sort complaines
against <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he saith,
<hi>How long wilt thou mourne for
Saul?</hi> God could not (if one
may say so) endure his lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and not hearken to his
suit. These are those waters
which in a manner offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to Heaven; The Spirit of
God moveth upon such waters,
and they make a river of oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Paradise. The tears which
are shed, the prayers which are
said, and the supplications
which are sent up to God for
others, are as acceptable to God,
and more peradventure than if
they were made for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
They are esteemed of

more merit, at least in regard
of the moralitie of the action.
Why th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> doe some Princes
perswade themselves, that they

Or to say more truly,
why doe some favourites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that there is such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety

to present the suits and

               <hi>Fill thy horne with oyle
(saith God to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet)

the Bethleemite, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his sonnes I

King: Hee answers,
How can I goe, for if

kill me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THus he answereth, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he feareth death, but
because hee is desirous to doe
service unto God; he much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
his life in that case wherein
to die is not to obey: Hence let
those that are imployed by
their Princes learne that the
death of the servant is seldome
the service of the Lord. It
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105632:16"/>
ought indeed to bee received
couragiously, but never to bee
encountred but when it is very
usefull, and when the dying is
an obeying. A man of worth
is a high prized instrument of
the greatnesse of his Prince, if
hee cares not to preserve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
for his owne sake, yet hee
ought to be careful of preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for his Lord and Masters
sake. Every man that is fitted
to die is not fit to doe service.
It is true also what I have said
even in the common Souldier,
(whose life rather than his brain
is dedicated to the Princes ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice)
that he ought also to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour
to obey, and not to die.
Hee that runnes headlong on
death, doth not spend his life to
the advantage, but casts it away
to the losse of his Lord; his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105632:16"/>
is to overcome, and not to
die, and indeed they lose that
are slaine. To expose needles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to death that body which can
doe service to its Prince, but
whiles it lives, is a most pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
desire of vaine glory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to good policy, against
good military discipline, and
an affection full of deceit and
flattery; into which even the
Generals whose life is most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
doe often precipitate
themselves, as if it were a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bravery to fight than to
command. But that Army is
but in a bad taking (pardon me
this digression) whose safety
consisteth in the arme, not in
the braine of the Generall. To
know how to command well in
warre, is a part of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
faculty. The imagination
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105632:17"/>
to worke well requireth a good
measure of heat, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is feare, which how little
so ever it bee, the other abates,
and how little so ever that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
the imagination is distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
whence it comes to passe
that to bee afraid and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
well cannot stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But how many are there
that incited more by Honour
than by Courage, do both fight
and feare? these may handle
the sword well, but yet not apt
for command. The heating of
the braine is not in our owne
power, as is the managing of
the hands: wee have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over that, howsoever <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

that there is no greater or surer
signe of a brave courage than
to command well in a battell;
where both Reputation and
life, yea, and many times the
State it selfe comes upon the
stage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord willeth Samuel to

            </p>
            <p>BEcause God could succour
him by ordinarie meanes,
hee would not have recourse to
extraordinary. If hee should
alwayes bee doing of miracles,
men would not thinke his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
so great in creating
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105632:18"/>
the second causes; and if hee
never used miracles, hee should
not perhaps be knowne to bee
Almightie. Where God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
many miracles, there is
commonly great need of them;
and where there is such need,
there is but little faith. When
hee is not knowne by his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
stamp, or Image, which
hee hath imprinted in the
things by him created, then he
findeth it requisite to make
himselfe seene in the workes of
his Omnipotencie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel obeyeth the Lord,
goeth and calleth Ishai
and his sonnes to the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and looking on Eliab
supposeth him to bee the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105632:18"/>man whom hee should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt,
because hee is the
tallest and the goodliest of
person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had the Prophet beene of the
opinion of those Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
who have censured
men of great stature to bee
void of wisdome, hee would
not at the first sight so much
have respected the talnesse
of stature. I for my part am
not of that opinion, but doe
hold it to bee most false.</p>
            <p>IF those Philosophers belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the neerenesse of the
braine to the stomack, doth
trouble the operations of the
understanding, and if they have
also imagined to themselves,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105632:19"/>
that the vitall spirits which
ascend from the heart, may
bee made animall spirits, for the
service and operation of the
Braine are unapt for such effect,
unlesse they bee first somewhat
cooled (because of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patibilitie
of wisedome with
heat) wherefore have they not
also affirmed the taller sort of
men to be wiser than the little,
as having their Braine farther
distant from the perturbations
of the stomack, and their spirits
not so hot by reason of their
long way, and larger distance
from their Originall? Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
they are deceived, in
that they beleeve that men are
alwayes great by the forming
Power, through the superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of matter, not observing
that many times there concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105632:19"/>
with it as a principall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
the Quantitie of heat,
as it is commonly verified in
those whose talnesse is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with slendernesse. It
hath therefore been noted as a
true observation, that the tall
men that have little heads, and
the little men which have great,
have more Braine than the rest,
which commeth to passe not as
many have thought, because
the little head in the great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the great in the little
maketh a mediocrity in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
stature of men; which
is false if wee measure the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocritie
of the part in respect
of the whole of which it is a
part: But because the little head
in a great man, is a signe that
the extension did proceed of
heat, and by consequence that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105632:20"/>
the littlenesse of that member
commeth through defect of
matter in the bony and fleshy
parts, which being but small,
produceth the thinner and
more delicate Organs which do
not obstruct, or hinder the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the braine. The lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
man having a great head, is
an argument that it is full of
braine, especially if he bee but
slender, for it cannot be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to the thicknesse of the
skull, because that Nature would
rather have imployed that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to have made the man tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
or greater. I am excusable if
I seeke by reason to overthrow
this doctrine, because I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to verifie it by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of mine owne stature.</p>

               <hi>The Lord willeth Samuel
not to regard the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

judging not as men doe by

            <p>LOe here the vanitie of
Metoposcopie and Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomie

or Comlinesse is a most perfect
consonancie arising out of the

the first Qualities: It gets in the

a radiant light in it selfe, that
(though wee know not why)
it doth if not inforce our

them strongly. The Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God hath seldome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the fairest body with
the fairest mind, that men
might not beleeve, that from
the same Harmony of tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the starres, from

The eldest may be stoutest, but
are not usually the wisest. That
tendernesse that commonly
enfeebleth the Children of our
old Age, maketh the organs of
their understanding more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and delicate. The cold of
him that engendreth, gives
them the more wisedome, and
his organs the better discourse:
whence it comes, that if the last
begotten be commonly the
weakest, yet they are oft and
many times the wisest. He that

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105632:22"/>
to the scepter, and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
him from the stable to the
Kingdome, it is hee that
humbled himselfe from his
Kingdome to the stable: Hee
that is both a sheepheard and a
King, maketh him a King who
was but a sheepheard. There is
a kind of Analogie in all sorts of
Commands. He that said that
to know well how to order a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
was a signe that hee knew
also how to marshall an Armie,
might as well say, that hee that
could well keepe a flock of
sheep, had the skill how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
a people well.</p>
            <p>God from the fold hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Kings, from husbandry and

will have the earth to
produce that which naturally it
doth not, and that it should
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105632:23"/>
produce hee wounds it. The
hunts-man by shedding the
blood of poore innocent beasts,
groweth to bee delighted in
Crueltie: But the sheepheard
conducts his flock to pasture,
brings it back to the fold, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth
it from maladies, and
defends it from wolves: his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their milk, &amp; their wooll,
is a disburthening of them, not
a wounding. Let Kings learne
to take their Ministers some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
even of the sheepfold.

yet judged that it may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prove to be of his introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and therefore termed it
the Bath of the devill, because
it is the Lees, because it is black,
because it hath an Analogie
with the darknesse of sinne:
The occasion of their beleefe
was the seeing sometimes how
by the fixation thereof men
were lifted up or elevated in an
extasie: Yea, and sometimes
how the sharpnesse thereof irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
the braine, and stirring
the Images therein, hath made
some to speake things whereof
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105632:24"/>
before they were not held ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable;
whence I thinke it came to passe,
that many oppressed
with the greatnesse of the effects
produced by this humour, have
often judged the animall spirits
to be infernall spirits.</p>
            <p>I deny not, there are found
some melancholicke persons
possessed with devills, or that
melancholy is an apt bath for
the devill; but I affirme it not
only of the grosse, thick and
dark melancholie, but even of
that also which produceth the
subtilest and lightest spirits. He
hath need of active bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
for his operations
in the body. Hee joynes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
therefore gladly with the
subtilest and finest spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they being in some sort
of a middle nature, being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105632:25"/>
and incorporeall, are a
more proportionate receptacle
for a spirit to unite himselfe to
a thing that is meerely corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall.
An ancient Sage beleeved
that our soule which hee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
to bee at first clothed
with aire, had need of the like
organs to joyne it to the body,
whereunto hee thought it not
united but assistant; neither are
there wanting among the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
those that have conceived
the Angles to be clothed in like
manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They tell Saul of David, that
he is strong, a valiant man
of war, can play well, is a
wise and a comely person,
and that God is with him.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:105632:25"/>
HOw should the devill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his possession, being
to bee assailed with so many
prerogatives, but that finding
in them some rayes of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Archangell <hi>Michael,</hi> hee
must needs slie and hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the bottomlesse pit of

It is an extraordinarie thing
amongst men, that their loves
become their overthrowes: the
affections of a corrupt mind, like
those of adiseased body, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
pernicious; nor are they
motions of Nature, but the
motions of that which hath
destroyed Nature, shee inclines
not to that which corrupts her,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105632:26"/>

               <hi>David sung and played when
Saul was vexed with the

Goodnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAd the devill a bodie, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
might haply bee able
to chace him out, being unable
to endure the power of Melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
hee who is a friend to it,
is an enemie to sinne. One that
writ hereof, tooke the deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Harmonie, to be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
signe of Praedestination:
Sinne discomposeth all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancies
in man, making a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105632:27"/>
between the inferiour and
superiour parts, which is the
cause of all evill, and finally of
the last of all dissonancies, which
is Death.</p>
            <p>If Health bee but a Harmony
of the Temperament, and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
a dissonancie, why are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
molested? why farther
distempered with divers me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,
and not rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a true temper with
consonancies? Musick would be
the truest medicine for all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies,
if wee knew the right
and true proportion, and how
to apply to each that kind of
Consonancie that would cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
it: If any acromatick mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
hath beene able to stir up
the melancholik humour and
to inrage it, why should not the
contrary bee effectuall to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and restraine it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:105632:27"/>
If Nature in our maladies did
happily feele that due consonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
that were requisite, shee
would peradventure rouze up
her selfe as well as the string of
an Instrument; which though
it be without life, yet stirs and
moveth it selfe, as soone as it
feeleth a perfect union. Shee
discovers the truth hereof, in
those that are stung or bitten
by the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> when wee see
that Nature strives not to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her selfe from that poyson,
untill shee bee first stirred wtih
that Consonancie, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
doth correct her. This
is not proper to that malady a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but all other I beleeve
would in the like manner bee
cured, if the Consonancies of
all were as well knowne: But
the ignorance of men, and the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105632:28"/>
discomposed nature of Sinne,
makes us runne to the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
when wee should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

the Israelites, Saul

            </p>
            <p>HEe was a Giant, and hee
was a bastard; The Giant
hath for his Correlative the rash
and foole-hardy: hee being

greater than men, thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
equall with God, as if
where Humanitie doth end,
there must needs Divinitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
and that there were not

This is that Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

their fighting against God.
The greatest individuals of one

<hi>Lucifers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee was a Bastard, and
Bastards are commonly valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
because they come of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
that were a norous. The
Birth and Parentage, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
makes men hide their
Talents, with the glories of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105632:29"/>
their forepassed Ancestors,
which bringeth them that are
present and living asleep, hath
no place in these who being
oftentimes poore and despised,
yet finding in themselves the
spirit of those that begot them,
in a desperate manner, get up
to the steepest of the mount of
Glory, alwayes egged on by the
bitter touches of their spotted
beginning; the continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and perpetuall spurre of
generous spirits. But if on the
contrarie their minds bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
with their miseries into
a dead sleep, and will not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
and awakened with the
sharp stings of Honour, they
are not worthy to be reckoned
amongst men; whence it ariseth
that Bastards most commonly
light upon the extremes either
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105632:29"/>
of valour or of basenesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Goliah desieth the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
to a single combat,
hee requires that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the whole warre
may hee restrained to the
fortune of one petty duell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO hazard their whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
without hazarding
at the same time all their forces,
hath beene taken to be no well
advised course: which yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
might doe well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
if men could be content
to lose all their fortune, before
they had lost all their forces.
The present victories then
might facilitate the future. But
such Conditions if ever they be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105632:30"/>
promised, are very seldome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
Such single Combats
are but Preludiums to set bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes,
and the happie successe
therein is rather a signe that
men may conquer, than that
they have done it. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation
of that party whose
Champion hath beene Victor,
is then taken to be stronger,
when it shall appeare that hee
is governed by that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines
to the King, and not
by his owne peculiar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There was none amongst the

REwards make valour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
which lay hid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
they produce it, they doe
not create it. It is great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in men to moderate their
promises when they are in great
dangers: To make too large
ones, is a token of feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and oftentimes doth not
prevent the danger, but chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
it: To deliver from great
dangers, yeelds great reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Rewards increase strength
and reputation, and strength
endangers the State: From
hence it comes that Promises
are not kept, not because they
are made with purpose not to
keep them, but because men
are changed with their change
of fortune, and hee that should
performe, is no longer the same
that promised.</p>

               <hi>David, who was returned

Armie, to bring certaine
presents to the Officers,
under whom his Brethren
did serve: Hee enquires
concerning the businesse in
hand: Hee askes what
shall be the reward. His
elder brother rebukes him
of pride and overweening.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THis man discernes not
Pride from Fortitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee looked on his brother
with an envious eye, not with
an eye of love. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vertues which have their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
common with vice,
being distinguished only by the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105632:31"/>
Intent: which because it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be seene, is judged of by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and mens judgements
are not alwayes without passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it seldome happens that
they judge without errour. He
would not have any adventure
on that which hee dares not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
on: Those defects that
are common, seeme rather the
defects of mankind, than of any
particular persons: hee layes
the blame on us, that by being
free from such defects himselfe,
acquites nature of them too.</p>

               <hi>David is brought before
Saul, who seeing him so
young, telleth him that he
is not able to fight with
the Giant, who was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
in warre from his
youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PRinces ought not to put
any upon a great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
who hath not first beene
brought up and tried in things
of the like nature. Danger hath
not the same looke with it when
wee are neere it, as when wee
are at a distance; when tis far
off from us, our understanding
represents only the Honour
and the Profit; but when wee
approach face to face, wee see
nothing oftentimes, but the
horrour of Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:105632:32"/>
It is true that Courage is a
reall thing in a man, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
hee knowes not that he
hath it, till experience hath
made him know that hee hath
had it. There are many that
prove better upon triall than
they thought they should have
done; and many come short of
the opinion they had of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Wise men are very
fearfull of danger, because they
have considered well of it: but
when they come to try it, and
are no longer to consider of it,
they stand no longer in feare of
it. On the contrary, they which
are of little judgement, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
all things alike, when
they find it otherwise than they
imagined, they grow also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times to be other manner of
men, than before they held
themselves for.</p>

               <hi>David to encounter this doubt

            </p>
            <p>TO recount our owne
doughty Acts is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
vanitie, here it is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie:
hee did not rehearse it
to shew that hee had overgone
great dangers, but to undergoe
greater; not to be commended,
but to bee commanded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul resolves to let David
goe to fight; Hee puts
on him his owne Armour,
which David being not
able to manage, puts it off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EVen as little men cannot
fight well with great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105632:33"/>
so neither can the lesser
Princes with those greater. He
that hath not fitted himselfe
with armour of his owne, is not
to fight in anothers. <hi>Patroclus</hi>
came not to his Death till hee
put on that of <hi>Achilles.</hi> This is
the common Doctrine of the
Politicians, yet I take it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to faile in regard that
there are often found men of
that worth, that like Ostriges,
they convert others Armes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their owne substance. This
may come to passe, when one
receiving an Armie without a
Head, makes himselfe to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
and managing them by
his valour, brings himselfe into
great estimation; If Generals
that were no Princes, have
sometimes drawne by such
meanes the Armies to be at
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105632:34"/>
their Devotion, and have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Kingdomes by such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
as were not their owne,
why should not a valorous
Prince be able to doe it by the
Armes of his Friends?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David goeth with his staffe
and his sling, with five
smooth stones against the
Giant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HEe had no need of other
Armour, hee was armed
with his confidence in God.
Hee which hath this Armour,
can never perish: If we hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be deceived, tis because
wee deceive our selves, having
our confidence in those things
in which wee ought not, or not
having so much as wee ought;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105632:34"/>
to bring forth a true act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
is a very difficult thing:
There is requisite a great
assistance of God to make one
truly and only relie on the
helpe of God. If such acts were
more frequent amongst us, we
should not haply account so
many Events to bee miracles.
They that teach us how not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
our Confidence
in God, wee ought to doe as
much as wee can, or otherwise
in stead of trusting in God wee
should presume upon him, their
meaning may haply bee, that
it were but a rash presumption
to perswade our selves that wee
have produced any true act of
Confidence; but not if wee
firmly beleeve that God for
his part would assuredly helpe
us, when wee for our part
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105632:35"/>
should produce such an Act.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Giant derides David,
curseth &amp; disdaines him,
but hee putting a stone in
his sling, throwes it at
him, hitteth him in the
forehead, makes him fall
groveling on his face to
the ground, and running
upon him cutteth off his
head with his sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT hath beene an ordinarie
thing in single combats, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
a giant-like man and
one of a meaner stature, that
the little man hath had alwayes
the better: The Philosophers
would attribute the cause to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105632:35"/>
the Courage which is counted
to be greater in the lesser heart;
a small fire will heat a little
roome, when a larger will scarce
bee warmed with a great one.
I have no assurance in this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but would rather adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(if I should not be thought
too bold) to affirme that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
consisteth not in the Heart,
as is commonly held both by
the ignorant vulgar, and many
of the learned: Who knoweth
that it is not rather produced by
the same imaginative facultie
out of which feare also procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth?
how many that in their
health were exceeding faint
hearted, in raging fits have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
rash and desperate, which
was occasioned only by the
heat of the Braine? for if it
proceeded from that of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105632:36"/>
Heart, they that are distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with fevers should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the most couragious:
and what is it that makes hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
men so resolute? Is it their
Heart forsooth growne lesse or
more heated than it was before?
or their understanding rather
which suggesteth unto them
that there is no other way to
escape death but by encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
it? To what purpose doe
men speake to cowards to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
them? Reasons may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
worke upon the Braine,
but are not able to heat the
Heart: Who knoweth not, that
the not knowing of the danger
makes men adventurous?
Whence it comes that the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
are not alwayes the most
couragious. Hardinesse (and
herein I refer my selfe to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105632:36"/>
better learned) is a certaine
kind of madnesse, consisting
haply in a hot distemper of
the Braine, which permitteth
no consideration or discourse
of the danger of Death. Hee
that in fighting thinkes hee
shall be slaine, cannot fight
couragiously. And albeit the
Philosophers define the valiant
man to be such a one as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the perils goes to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, because it is just aud
honest. I beleeve it ought to be
understood before hee entreth
into those dangers, because after
he is once engaged, if he knew
them hee would faint. A wise
man was of the minde, that fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
were more fearfull than
others, because they knew the
danger more than others: It is
not therefore the Heart, but the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105632:37"/>
Braine, and if it come from the
Heart, it must be in regard that
the same is the originall of all
the operations of the Minde.
The Divines going a surer
way, would resolve this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme
by saying, that it hath
beene the pleasure of God by
humilitie to overthrow Pride,
and by the least things to abase
the greatest: If it were not
so not only in men, but also in
States and Empires, there
would be no tides and ebbes in
the world, but hee that was
once the greatest should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
so continue, seeing hee
could not be overcome by a
lesser.</p>
            <p>The Politicians would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage
Disdaine to be the cause:
hee that despiseth his enemie,
doth not strive with all his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105632:37"/>
might, but employing some part
only, and that with no great
heed, is often overcome by one
who being weaker than hee, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
him with the utmost of
his strength and cunning: One of
the greatest errours that I have
observed in great Potentates,
hath beene to see how applying
their forces on an enterprise,
they have rather taken measure
of the enemie than themselves,
opposing against him only so
much of their strength, as they
conjectured to bee answerable
to the present affaires; and
whereas with a greater power
they might have beene sure of
victory, with an equall one they
have either lost it, or at least
prolonged the warres with
more expence of men and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
It is very difficult to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105632:38"/>
the proportion of things
by their Beginnings. Childrens
garments must be allowed to be
somewhat larger than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
lest they growing grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the garments become too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
It is enough for a meaner
man if at the beginning hee bee
enabled to resist a greater, that
so he may but get him reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by the meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hee can procure himselfe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
and protectors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Giant was no sooner

THat Armie whose trust is
in the straightnesse of some
passage, in the height of any si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
in the strength of their
Trenches, in the valour of a
man, or in any one speciall
thing of good defence, is easily
overcome by him who shall be
assuredly perswaded, that if he
can but overthrow such a part,
or slay such a man, or passe
through the difficulties of such
a hill, or such fortifications, he
shall find no other resistance,
and therefore shall hee set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
very stoutly and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously:
Because men having
once lost that by which they
were confident they should o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,
being dejected, thinke
there is nothing left that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them against the valour of
their enemies. But that Armie
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105632:39"/>
which relies upon it intire selfe
equally throughout is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
invincible; It may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
bee routed, utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited
it cannot: Every one
will fight to the Death, because
every one trusting in himselfe,
will not distrust of the victory,
untill he hath lost his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The slaughter being ended,
David returnes with the
Giants head. Saul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of Abner who he
is: Abner not knowing
him, goes to meet him, and
brings him unto Saul:
He askes him whose sonne
hee is: hee answers, he is
the Sonne of Ishai.</hi>

               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:105632:39"/>
SEe how fading or how dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
the memory of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
is in Princes; either <hi>Saul</hi>
did not remember <hi>David,</hi> or
else hee was not willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
him: Hee that but a
little before had found so much
favour in his sight, hath now
lost it both in his sight and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie:
The memory of a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
lasts well, if it lasts as long as
the benefit, and the respect that
is begotten thereby often dies
before its Father. If Reasons
may bee rendered for the
affection of a Prince towards a
Courtier, bee they drawne of
Profit or out of Pleasure, or
whether accompanied with
Honestie, yet is it a thing but
of small continuance: If it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Reason, it formes a habit
of which commeth satietie, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105632:40"/>
if it be not grounded on Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the ground of such affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
faileth. It is a vanity to
thinke our selves able to yeeld
a reason of the affectionate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of Princes: Those are
great, and slowly will they end,
for which there can no reason
be given how they came to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.
There are starres which
incline them thereunto by
their influences, neither are
those loves alwayes happie, for
neither are the aspects of these
alwayes favourable: In this
manner haply that great
scholler meant it, though hee
was not so understood, when
hee seemed to doubt, whether
any reason could be given of the
Inclinations of Princes, or
whether they depended on the
Course of their Nativitie. And
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105632:40"/>
whereas in all other occurrents
hee had shewed himselfe a
friend unto reason, hee never
spake of this Argument or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but made a present recourse
unto Destinie, which having
once coupled and conjoyned
with the course of the Nativity,
there is no doubt but he meant
it by the operation of the
starres. Politicians may cease to
teach the waies to obtaine the
favour of Princes; men must be
borne to it, not taught it. A man
may by his valour and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
make himselfe well estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but yet not beloved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When hee had made an end of
speaking, the soule of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan
was knit with<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105632:41"/> the
soule of David, in a knot
of Amitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WOnderfull things are
Friendship and Love,
whence they proceed (with all
respect, and far from all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
be it spoken) men
have not yet well declared for
all their Philosophie. Some
have thought them to bee the
daughters of Abundance, and
of Want; but this were a taxing
of Love and Amitie with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
and to deny the
prime and chiefe love which
wee call the holy spirit: for in
the three divine Persons there
can bee no defect. The rest of
the Philosophers, have deduced
the originall from the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the parties loving, some
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105632:41"/>
from the Heaven, some from
the starres, some from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
some from the Manners, &amp;
some finally from the features,
yet peradventure they have all
mistaken: for if love came from
the resemblance, a man should
rather love the male than the
female; and whereas Love is
but seldome reciprocall, it
should be alwayes answered
with like affection; seeing one
thing cannot be said to bee like
another, but that the other must
also be like to it. I beleeve that
there are some Constellations
conducing to Friendship, and
others to Love, which produce
in their subject, a kind of lovely
Character which commeth not
of the Temper, but rather of
some (I know not what) ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
impressions which the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105632:42"/>
Heavens and starres with their
operations have left imprinted
in that tender body, and that
hee is most beloved that hath
most thereof, and that hee who
hath lesse cannot be the object
of Love, but onely of good
will or respect. The reason
whereof is because Beautie is
the object of Love: Yet not
Beauty which is like unto ours,
but that which is greater, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
there would not (no not in
<hi>Patria)</hi> be any love towards
God: And if sometimes here we
love our equall, it is either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
then wee see none more
worthy, or because wee doe not
reflect thereon. But onely that
excellence which is in God is
the adequate object of Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that onely which is in
God is the adequated object of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105632:42"/>
our will: and if wee could see
him as hee is, hee should infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
make us love with him.
But because wee are here as but
in <hi>Via,</hi> he is not so represented
to us: we turne our eyes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
that celestiall Beautie
where we finde it best imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among us, and is often ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Gratia divisata,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
neither in the symmetrie
of the Humours, nor the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the Lineaments, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
it oftentimes accordeth and
agreeth well with them both
when it is not hindered by any
defect in the matter, and so
sometimes, but not alwaies the
fairest bee the best beloved.
Hence we may learne the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the little correspondence,
and the much mutability in
Love: It is not alwayes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanged,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105632:43"/>
for if the greater
Beauty be beloved, that which
is beloved will not love that
which loveth it. It is changed
as oft as there is represented to
us greater beauty than which
wee love. Yet it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that it be represented unto
us, if wee doe not reflect upon
with a desire, and therefore
many leave not their first love,
because they permit not any
new object of love to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul suffereth not David to

               </gap>,
how will he governe his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
If hee take such, how
will hee be a King? Hee is not
King over others that hath in
his Palace a greater man than
himselfe. If his stare be unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled,
he loseth his state; if the
state be safe, his reputation:
With great reason men might
complaine of Nature, if they
were not for the most part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the better. He that
holds the Scepter, is not the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105632:44"/>
King, hee is but the servant of
his Minister who obeyeth him.
Crownes come by Inheritance,
tis true; but not the faculties of
ruling: If fortune give those to
whom shee pleaseth, Nature
disposeth the other to him that
deserves. That Proposition of
the Philosophers is most true,
that some are bound to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and others to obey: This
is confirmed by him that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the signes of the Zodiack
into commanding and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
signes. This truth is not
overthrowne by seeing him to
hold a Scepter that was borne
fitter for the mattock; though
hee play the King, he is not a
King.</p>

            <p>SHort and unhappie are the
favours of the People; short,
for like the floating of the sea it
is tost with every winde; a Sea
that in the same haven wherein
one time it hath secured ships,
another sinkes them. Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
are they, because it is as a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
starre, whose radiall
beames may be good, but not
lucky; it never raiseth any but to

unhappie love because it
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105632:45"/>
hath for a Correlative the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
hatred: The Prince is not
Lord of that people that loveth
another better than him: If he
be Master of their bodies and
meanes, the other is Master over
their Hearts and minds: But
good God! how shall a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himselfe? must a mans va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
needs become his infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
A wise man may indeed
not desire applause, but hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hinder it, except he leave
those qualities for which he is
applauded, or depart from them
that applaud him. Ought hee
then to forgoe the Talents
which God hath bestowed on
him? or employ them only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
wild beasts in the horrid
wildernesses, or in solitary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
The eminent vertue of
men, if it be not the cause of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105632:45"/>
their Death, is so of their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment:
At the first they are
sought to out of necessitie, and
then againe they are expelled
under colour of necessitie. The
Tree that was esteemed for its
shadow, to shelter us from the
heat of the summer, is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
cut downe to defend us
from the cold of the winter.
The same man whom Princes
embraced in the heat of their
necessity, is he whom they cut
downe in the cold of their je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul since that never looked

to give a violent <hi>Metum</hi> to our

aspect, whether by staring
fiercely, or looking askew upon
him, to strike him with our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
spirits, and with the greatest
quantity and worst quality that
may be. He that thinks them not
to issue out of the eyes, and that
they proceed not to touch the
object, when it is neere them, is
deceived, and hee that beleeves
it, will not deny that they have
their operation on that subject.
If the only diversitie of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
make the selfe same radia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the starre, to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
gratious, and sometimes
deadly, why should not the

their effects, according

            <p>
               <hi>It was not long ere the Devill
assaulted Saul againe;
and when David plaied
and sung, to deliver him
from the oppression of the
spirits, hee with a speare
in his hand would have
slaine him, but David a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
the blow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THat Tyrant is put to
a shrewd pinch, that is
growne jelous of a subject of
worth and reputation: If hee
kill him, hee feares the rising of
the people: If he suffer him,
hee doubts his raysing of them.
Now hee accounts himselfe
happy if in his oppressing him,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105632:47"/>
hee could make the faults of his

with the imputation of a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
smother that of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull.
A most wicked peece
of Policie, to make our greatest
defects the best instruments of
our Government: There hath
beene one that made use of
drunkennesse, to secure himselfe
of the most valorous man of his
Armie; and <hi>Saul</hi> doth the like
by his vexation with spirits to
make <hi>David</hi> away: Such co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable
carriages doe move the
ignorant rout to compassion,
rather than to rebellion, whiles
they give place to Princes to
bewaile the death of those,
whom themselves have slaine,
and to make them beleeve that
their teares of joy are teares of
lamentation.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:105632:47"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul perceived that God was
with David, when hee
could not slay him with the
casting of his speare, from
which his valour could not
defend him because hee
did not expect it, neither
his wisedome because hee
did not foresee it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HEe that will know when
God is with his enemie
(and this is a morall and not a
naturall knowledge) let him
not consider the conquests made
by his valour, and by that which
wee call Prudence, but the
helpes he receiveth from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
inanimate things, as Clouds,
winds, fires, snow, ice, raine
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105632:48"/>
and tempests; for they, as it is
written, fulfill the will of God.
What availeth our valour if
God be not with us? and what
is our Prudence if God doe not
governe it? It is nothing (I
speake of politick Prudence,)
for it is a good connexion of
present, things with the future
and those that are past: but of
that which is past, and which
is present, we know but little,
and of what is to come wee
know nothing: For my part
(in regard of future things) I
esteeme that as wee give unto
God an unproper attribute of
that which hee hath not, so we
suppose also a vertue in man
which is not in him. God hath
not properly any prescience,
because there is nothing future
in respect of him, neither is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105632:48"/>
there any Prudence in man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee knoweth not what is
to come. That which is in God
is more properly to be termed
knowledge, because it is intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and the other in man may
be called Chance, because it
works on a subject which may
be or not be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then Saul began to bee afraid
of David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THat the Prince should be
afraid of his subject, and
the subject stand in feare of his
Prince, hath beene accounted a
Harmonie to hold the State
happily together. This opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
howsoever it may seeme a
witty conceit, while such feare
keeps in the meane, &amp; groweth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105632:49"/>
not excessive, notwithstanding
is most false: It is true that hot
and dry may be corrected by
degrees, even as heavy and
light may be their Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poises,
because the degrees of
the one are knowne, and the
weight also of the other; but
the affections of the minde can
hardly be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terpoised, because
they have no firmenesse nor
measure. Feare hath too sharpe
a prick for those that produce
it, and is too troublesome a
passion to them that owne it;
the one with the qualities that
make them to bee feared, are
spurred on forward after the
Government: The other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
willingly hold themselves,
in, because feare is a motion
that is not naturall but violent.
There is no man that desireth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105632:49"/>
not to free himselfe of it: The
greater part attempt it, and in
attempting it the State is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
If the Prince be hee that
feareth, he turneth to be a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
and if any subject make
himselfe feared, t'will breed a
Conspiracie; if the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalty,
a Rebellion. The
subject ought to feare the
Justice of his Prince, and the
Prince that of God; if a subject
make himselfe feared, he is no
longer a subject, or intends not
to be so; if the Prince be afraid,
he is no longer Prince, or not
like long to bee. To thinke to
make a Prince good by Art,
may chance prove but fopperie;
they are rather borne to it than
brought to it: The goodnesse
of a Prince consisteth in I know
not what in expressible mystery,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105632:50"/>
that cannot be knowne, nor can
be taught: It wanteth nothing
of the last Individuation which
gives it the being, and that same
being and no other. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of mine resolves the
Probleme that demandeth how
it comes to passe, that many
who in the managing of great
affaires, were held to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the highest dignity and
Dominion, having after attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to it, beene found to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul made David a Colonel
over a thousand Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and said after that hee
would give him his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Merob to be his wife,
supposing that to obtaine
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105632:50"/>her, hee would so far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
against the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims,
that hee would be
slaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>SAul</hi> would that <hi>David</hi>
should be slaine, but God
permitted not that hee should
be past the shame of being
wicked, till it could no more
hurt <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> was past
it. This errour of advancing
men that are rising, and not to
know afterward how to take
them downe, hath often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
even to those that justly
and without any offence of God
ought to have done it. A starre
though but a Comet, because it
is a light that is newly up,
draweth all mens eyes to it,
even theirs whose dammage it
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105632:51"/>
threatneth. A man of worth
can no sooner begin to appeare,
but Princes begin to embrace
him, thinking to raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by his Friendship, when
indeed hee raiseth himselfe by
theirs, not heeding that in stead
of growing they decrease. It is
a difficult thing for one to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
himselfe, if he be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
or impugned by a great
one: Many times when one
hath begun to advance another
by protecting him, hee raiseth
him higher by crossing of him,
not because it is likely he would
then second him, but because he
knoweth not how to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
him. Men are ashamed,
yea, and sometimes afraid to
shew themselves open enemies
of one that is thought to bee
their friend who hath deserved
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105632:51"/>
well of them, and is accounted
valorous. They seeke then by
subtile sleights to overthrow
him, and therewith advance
him the more. They are not
resolved to use force untill their
subtilities faile them, and when
there is no securitie in using of
force. Neither yet doe I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it if they then goe about
to second them, for the things
that are forward in growing
should never be seconded. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline</hi>
by being opposed was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne,
and though in <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
it had not the like effect, it
happened so, because he was
first seconded, and afterwards
opposed: Yet was it better
once to resist than alway to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
him, because where the
victory was doubtfull, the losse
had beene certaine. I am firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105632:52"/>
perswaded that if <hi>Catiline</hi>
had prevailed to be Emperour,
and <hi>Caesar</hi> had beene slaine, the
writers would have blamed the
impugning of <hi>Catiline,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the opposing of <hi>Caesar;</hi>
because there are many Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
that make use of examples
not to confirme their reasons,
but to frame them. The errours
of men consist in watering the
Plant that groweth, placing it in
their owne garden, delighting
in the Beauty of it, and not
knowing that it is a kind of
Wolfes-bane, untill they strain
at it and pull it up, and then it
killeth them. If the great ones
knew what hurt they receive
by shewing themselves enemies
to a little one, they would not
permit any sparkes to fly forth,
if they were not such sparkes
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105632:52"/>
as forthwith give fire to the

began, whether tending to
enmity or to amitie. <hi>Saul</hi> seeth
not how in deceiving <hi>David</hi> he
deceives himselfe; and thinking
to lay an impediment in his
way to the Kingdome, hee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
him the way thereunto.
Some one hath made use of
such meanes with better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
but with more cunning.
Hee was a private person, and
not yet a Prince, when he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his Sister to his equall, not
unto his inferiour, to lull him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep
without advancing him;
and because hee to whom hee
married her was not so wise as
<hi>David,</hi> hee hoped by such a
marriage to have help to
strengthen his side, and to find
a just occasion to oppresse his
Kinsman. But <hi>Saul</hi> had no need
of <hi>Davids</hi> help to attaine to that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105632:53"/>
Kingdome which hee possessed
already: Hee was without
comparison greater than hee,
and might rather feare to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the reputation of <hi>David,</hi>
than to bring his prudent
watchfulnesse asleep, which was
not like to give him any just
occasion to oppresse him. It is
no safe advice to advance men
to the end to abuse them: The
advancement is alwayes suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull,
but there is difficultie
often found in abasing them.
This is written for one of the
neatest peeces of policie, but I
set it downe amongst the most
confused.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul sendeth word to David,
that hee doth not disdaine
his poverty, and that hee<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105632:54"/>
demands no other Dowry
than a hundred fore-skins
of the Philistims.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HEre comes now on the
Stage one of the Engines
which were hidden under the
Honour of Marriage; to bring
<hi>David</hi> in danger to be slaine by
the Philistims. If Nature had
not often accompanied the
most certaine perils with the
most conspicuous glories, it
were a commendable course
to expose them to such dangers
whose reputation terrifies us;
but because neere the greatest
downefals are the highest hils,
it is not safe to let men clime up
the tops of those mountaines,
where they may as well raise
up as ruine themselves. Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105632:54"/>
is it which makes men
wise, or which brings them to
bee knowne. Hee that at first
sight could see into men of
ability by a hidden token,
should under pretence of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
make them spend their
dayes in delicacie and idlenesse,
and not suffer men to have a
sight of that light, which untill
it be stricken out doth never
appeare. The seeds of Plants
that are kept in vessels of Gold,
or of Pearle, or of pretious
stone, are honoured thereby,
but being as buried and become
barren, they bring forth no
buds unlesse they be first cast
into the Soile of the earth.
Without motion there is no
Augmentation. Resting is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in things that may
increase: In God only it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105632:55"/>
because in him there is
no Augmentation. It is not in
our power to make our selves
great. The utmost limit of our
Actions is in the hand of men,
or of Fortune. How many
that have beene very able in
<hi>Potentiâ,</hi> have come to their
grave without having any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
to performe an Act
worthy their sufficiencie?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul speaketh to Ionathan,
and to all his servants, that
they should kill David: Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan
advertiseth Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
and putteth Saul in
mind how much hee is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to him, and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
it were to slay him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:105632:55"/>
BUt of what effect bee such
Remonstrances of Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
The chiefe Obligation
which a Tyrant pretends to
have, is the conservation of his
Dominion, and his greatest
Justice is to put to death the
best. To oblige were a thing
very desiderable if it were only
to oblige, and not to bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
for a farther obliging. That
Obligation which seemed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
to him that produced it,
comes to be accepted but as a
beginning by him for whom it
was wrought. Hee that will
bind another by benefits, must
joyne them one to another:
The report of the one must not
cease before hee hath added a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
The linkes that are
not chained one to another doe
not make up a Chaine. The
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105632:56"/>
resemblance hath a great force
to move and receive in the
Imagination even the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes
that were dead.</p>
            <p>Time is a destroyer of all
things; where it destroyeth not
the greatnesse of mens Actions,
it will destroy the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at it: for it frames
them into a habit, and that
being once attained, makes the
operations come on without
difficultie, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting.
That which is passed
already doth cancell the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of private men; and with
Tyrants that also which is to
come, whether they be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
or ungratefull, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
afraid, that they will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them either by their owne
rewards, or through discontent
of not being rewarded, will
make insurrection.</p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:105632:56"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The words of Ionathan see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to have appeased
Saul, who giveth order
that David returne to
Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe Truth which passeth
through our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
doth not use to flie away
so fast, but that our will taketh
hold and embraceth it, unlesse
the malice of our senses defile
it. It is not so hard to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
a wicked man from his
evill purposes, as it is difficult
afterward to keepe him in a
good mind, thereto is requisite
in a manner a perpetuall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
for as soone as you leave
him hee returneth to that from
which you withdrew him.</p>
            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:105632:57"/>
            <p>
               <hi>David returneth to the Court
as informer times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THey must not all bee put
to death of whose valour
wee stand in feare, that thereby
wee may be secured. To use
a like proceeding is inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
when the persons are of a
different disposition. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
that serve to aid and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the wickedly minded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Prince, are but as
Chaines, whereby generous
mindes are drawne to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.
So that to oblige them
is to bind them: But the ruine
of the good proceeds from the
multitude of the Evill: which
are not only evill, but doe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
as if they were good;
so that because it is a difficult
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105632:57"/>
thing to discerne Truth and
Falshood, men will rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves in hindering
a thousand that ought to bee
cherished, than in cherishing
one alone that ought to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
and because it is easier
to be ingratefull than to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their gratitude, though
they beleeve not alwayes that
it is necessarie to put deserving
men to death, yet they feigne
sometimes that they beleeve
it, that they may cover the
basenesse of their minds with
the forcible jelousies of their
Soveraigntie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The evill spirit returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to molest Saul, when
David played, Saul at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth
againe to smite
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105632:58"/>him to the wall with a
speare, but hee turneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
and escapeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHen the subject once
finds his Prince to bee
afraid of him, hee stands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in feare of the Prince;
such jelousies have no other fire
to consume them but impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
for he that stands in feare,
beleeves that whatsoever may
happen unto him, will. The
first perill wee incurre in any
thing may be ascribed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
the second if it bee the
same is commonly attributed to
our indiscretion. But the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>David</hi> makes him to be
excusable in regard his excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
good conscience made
him so adventurous: <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:105632:58"/>
trusteth <hi>Saul,</hi> because <hi>Saul</hi>
might safely have trusted <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
As we naturally imagine
other men to looke like our
selves, so wee suppose them of
our owne conditions. That
which shall happen to a man, is
not alwayes the same that
should. The consequences of
the future are fallible, because
the Antecedents presupposed
by us are false. Hee that knew
well the customes and manners
of all men as they are, and upon
occasion should make use of
them in conjecturing what is
to come, should not need to
have recourse to the vanity of
Astrologers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul causeth Davids house
to be compassed with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105632:59"/>that should kill him,
yet gives them not order to
enter into the house, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
because in those
times it was reputed too
great a wickednesse to kill
one in his bed. Having
given over himselfe a prey
to wickednesse, hee had
not haply as yet lost all
respect unto goodnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THat men are not altogether
wicked, nor yet perfectly
good, is not peradventure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they know not how to be
so, but because they cannot
possibly be so: It consisteth
rather in the strength of nature
than of will: For if Nature
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105632:59"/>
have left no power to our fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
to reach to the height
of goodnesse, why shall wee
beleeve that shee hath left any
to our corruption to come to
the extremity of evill? He that
blamed a Tyrant in that behalf,
and thereupon did pretend that
their ruine was for the most
preordained, declared his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
to be, that the mischiefes
which are destructions were
conservations: He discovered
his not knowing, that the evill
which is not a being, cannot
subsist without the supporting
of that good which is a being;
and finally he made it manifest,
that he had not read the Master
of those Doctrines, with which
hee had honoured his writings,
because his saying was, that the
Tyrant, when hee goeth not in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105632:60"/>
the way of goodnesse, must not
suffer it to bee quite out of his
sight, and that if he will not be
good throughout, yet that hee
must at least have a Moity of
goodnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michol tels David what
perill hee is in; shee
lets him downe through a
window, and layes an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
in his place in the
Bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOd makes use of the Acts
of human wittinesse, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of his Providence;
those footsteps that flie it, are
the selfe same that lead to it:
<hi>Saul</hi> makes <hi>David</hi> his sonne in
Law, to bring him to his end;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105632:60"/>
and because he is his sonne in
Law, he escapes it: That sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
That the Destinies lead
those that follow them, and
draw those that are unwilling, is
an unadvised saying. They that
wrote it were deceived either
in denying the Providence of
God, or in the manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
it: Hee disposeth all
things sweetly: He conducteth
them that goe with a good will,
and those that are unwilling to
goe, are conducted (if I may
so say) by themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul sendeth some againe to
take David, they bring
word that hee is sick in his
bed: Finally, he loseth all
respect of bed, and will
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105632:61"/>have him slaine how ever;
but instead of David they
find an Image: Saul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
his daughter Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol,
who excuseth her
selfe by her Husbands
threats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MEn in their desires invest
themselves so far in their
owne interest, that they make
themselves beleeve that every
one that knowes them should
cooperate with them: but if
they also invested themselves
in the interest of others, and
did not consider every one in
reference to themselves, but
rather each one in reference to
himselfe, and whereas they
thinke but of theirs alone, they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105632:61"/>
formed as many interests as
there are men, they would not
find themselves so oft deceived.
<hi>Saul</hi> considereth <hi>Michol</hi> as his
daughter, and by consequence
in reference to himselfe; if he
had considered her as <hi>Davids</hi>
wife, then he had considered
her in reference to her selfe, and
had not found it strange that she
should save her husband out of
her fathers hands: When wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
depart from their friends
houses, they oftentimes leave
nothing behinde them but
Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul sends some after David,
they find him in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the Prophets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying
with them; hee
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105632:62"/>sends others after him, and
they find him in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
In the end full of
anger and fury, he goes
himselfe, and he also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
with them, and
prophesieth in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THere are some so supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
that they account all
things miraculous, because they
are ignorant of their second
causes: some againe are so
head-strong, as to deny all mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
because they know not the
first cause; and in conclusion
there want not those that are so
sacrilegious, that they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
acknowledge the <hi>Devill</hi> to
be the doer of such miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105632:62"/>
effects than God, because
they themselves are more of
the <hi>Devill</hi> than God. I know
not whether <hi>Saul</hi> might be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
among these, or whether
knowing the miracle, hee suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himselfe neverthelesse to
be transported by his anger
and fury to contend with the
Almightie. All sinners in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of themselves doe undeifie
him, yet there are found very
few that doe desire to undeifie
him, yet are there not wanting
some, who in their choler
would willingly they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to nothing, that hath
brought them out of nothing.
Hee that is in choler, I would
say hath even lost his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
yea, I would thinke
him starke mad, save that there
remaineth only so much reason
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105632:63"/>
in him, as sufficeth to make his
workes worthy of chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Choler (and perhaps
I am not deceived) is a short
fever; which if it were in the
humours as it is in the spirits,
would prove to bee a frenzie,
whereunto it is so neere of kin,
that if by the little while it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
it were not knowne
from the other, there would
scarce be any such piercing eye
that could discerne betwixt
them: That little reason that
remaines in the cholerick man
makes him to differ from the
mad man; yet makes him worse
than hee, because it makes him
not only to erre, but to sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David flies, and going to meet
Ionathan, he asketh him
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105632:63"/>what evill hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
that should procure
Saul to persecute him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HEe knew not peradventure
that an eminent Vertue is
no lesse persecuted than an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
Vice. I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that even Tyrants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
doe like well, that their
Ministers be men of valour and
worth, but they would measure
them as they doe cloth, by
their arme, allowing them as
much as will fit the person they
represent, and no more: Good
Ministers are sometimes better
than the best, because the best
are sometimes as dangerous as
the worst are dishonourable. It
is a happinesse in Princes how
good soever they be, to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105632:64"/>
by good subjects equall to
their affaires, for if they be of
abilities above their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they neglect them, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
them, their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ruine them. It is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
thing therefore to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
on such as are fit for the
purpose; seeing wee have no
Instrument by which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of worth may be measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
neither any one that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
justly how much every of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
requireth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ionathan answereth David
that hee should not need
to feare, because his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would not resolve on
any enterprise without
communicating the same<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105632:64"/>
to him, and that he would
advertize him thereof:
But David doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that Saul would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO what end should a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
communicate his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations?
they are so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that hee cannot expect
commendations: Hee is so
distrustfull, that he will not
seeke any counsell, and so farre
from trusting others, that hee
scarcely trusteth himselfe. One
must needs beleeve this Truth,
when wee see that distrusting
the better part of himselfe,
which is Reason, his trust is
wholly in his sense: when he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105632:65"/>
communicates his thoughts, he
doth not impart them to have
conference about them, but to
command, not to be counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
concerning them, but to
have them put in execution. He
hath no regard of sonnes, or
brethren, or wife, or friend.
The interest of State is all in all
with him, and besides it hee
makes no account of any thing.
A Tyrant is ordinarily so close
by nature, and so enured by Art
to conceale his intent, that
when hee would willingly bee
understood, hee cannot some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
make them understand
them. For not only men know
not what hee thinkes, but many
times they understand not
what he sayes.</p>
            <pb n="125" facs="tcp:105632:65"/>
            <p>
               <hi>They agree that David
should hide himselfe, and
Ionathan should observe
what the King saith when
on the first day of the
moneth he should note Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids
absence from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that by a signe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them hee should
make knowne his fathers
intent. Then they depart
as under renewing their
oathes and covenants of
friendship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe first day of the moneth
being come, <hi>Saul</hi> seeing
that <hi>David</hi> appeared not, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
his desire hee would not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105632:66"/>
beleeve that <hi>David</hi> absented
himselfe for feare, but rather
for some uncleannesse: when he
sees him not appeare on the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
day, hee asketh <hi>Ionathan</hi>
what is become of <hi>David,</hi> who
answereth that hee is gone to
celebrate the solemnity; then
<hi>Saul</hi> reproachfully reproveth
his sonne for preferring his
friendship with <hi>David</hi> before
matter of State, by reason that
while <hi>David</hi> lived hee could
not be established in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>To chastise an offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
is proper to the Law:
that which would be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
is reserved to God; that
which may be committed is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to a Tyrant: when it is
not justice, but a point of State
that seekes the life of a subject,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105632:66"/>
there is scarce any remedie: if
<hi>David</hi> had offended, he might
have hoped for pardon, and
haply have obtained it: But
where there i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> no offence there
can be no recourse to clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
nor expectation of it. Those
merits that would have counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
his faults, doe condemne
his innocencies. A great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
it mu<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> hee to put an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
to death, and because it is
great, it is insuperable. When
justice hath had her course in
condemning, shee leaves Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
her place to absolve; but
where it is injustice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne,
the putting to death
proceeds of selfe interest. It is
good for him that dyes, if hee
dye innocent; but in regard of
the world it is better being
guilty when he is condemned.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105632:67"/>
Hee that hath done an offence,
and demands pardon, speakes
not a word but to the Princes
praise, hee confesseth his fault,
declareth the vertue of Justice
in the Prince, and in deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his pardon he shewes that
hee doth also beleeve the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of clemencie to be in him.
But all the words of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
sound to the blame of the
Prince; hee shewes him to bee
unjust, hee declares him to be
a Tyrant, hee seekes not to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
him; he incenses him, and
cannot hope for mercy because
hee cannot aske it: if hee pray
the Prince to spare him his life,
hee must needs discover the
cause that moves him to take it
away, and because hee disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
it, hee is made worthie of
Death.</p>

               <hi>Ionathan demands of Saul,
for what offence hee doth
persecute David: but the
King in a rage casts a

            </p>
            <p>THere is nothing more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
to a Prince than to
require him to declare what he
desires to conceale. The word
(why) or (when) imports an
Interrogation, ought never to
bee found in their mouthes that
treat with Princes: The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogating
hath I know not
what superiority, because it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
one to answer, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are not to be obliged, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <hi>Ionathan riseth from the
Table in a great anger, he
goes the next morning
where David was, and
gives the signe according
to their agreement. David
comes out of the place
where hee was hid: Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
informes him of his
successe, and reiterating
the oathes of their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracie,
and the tokens of
their Amity, not without
tender teares they depart
asunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHat thing is Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
It is a union as
one may say of two soules in one
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105632:68"/>
bodie, which in a sort doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it, if not truly yet vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;
and if a soule be so much
grieved when it is to depart out
of an earthly body which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
why should it not also
bee grievous to depart from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
soule which she loved?
Such a departure should be but
as a death, were it not that
the distance of place doth not
breake off the union of those
things that doe not possesse any
place. But as in the parting of
frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds the souls are not so much
afflicted, the bodies are grieved
in forgoing the fomentation of
those spirits that were a conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to them. It is not credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that Nature having permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us spirits to offend us with,
hath not also granted that the
spirits of a friend should bee
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105632:69"/>
comfortable unto us. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the spirits of Hatred and
of Love should be the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David flieth and commeth to
Nob to Achimelech the
Priest, who marvelling to
see him alone, demands the
occasion thereof. David
answers that hee goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Kings service,
who hath so commanded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HEe saith truth, that hee
goes about the Kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
for in flying hee doth the
King good service by bereaving
him of occasion to doe a great
outrage. His flight is not to
escape chastisement for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105632:69"/>
but to avoyd the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous

            <p>O the lamentable condition
of men of high desert, they
have two most potent enemies,
Envy and Feare, the one very
hardly to be overcome, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impossible, nay rather the
victorie over the first makes the
other the greater. Envy like a
mountaine, it the waters of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
increase, is sometimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed:
but feare like a ship,
the more they increase, the
higher doth it rise. What must
they doe then, that are so beset
with impossibilities? Let them
couragiously make head against
the obstacles of their good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
if where it is; and where
not, let them give place to the
evill. It is necessarie sometimes
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105632:70"/>
even in a storme to strive
against the winde, if wee see
the haven neere at hand, but if
it be far off, it is better to strike
saile and runne adrift than to
make shipwrack. The most
worthy when they are not the
greatest, become the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate:
Valour can never
clearely be discerned but only
in a Prince: There, because it
is profitable to the subjects,
they reverence and feare it not,
and because it is an honour to
them, they commend and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
it not. It is so faire a
thing, that if those two mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Feare and Envie, did
not deforme it, men would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
adore it, but haply God
permitteth them to deforme it,
lest it should be adored, because
it is adored over much when it
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105632:70"/>
is not so deformed. If it be true
that it is agreeable to nature,
that the best should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, it
cannot bee contrary to Nature,
that the better should be feared
by him that doth command. If
the eminency of vertue could
bee laid aside, perhaps there
would not some bee wanting,
that to lead a quiet life would
willingly reduce themselves to
that mediocritie that might
keepe them from contempt,
and defend them from envie:
But as that eminencie is faire,
and not easie to be acquired, so
it is sometimes hurtfull, because
it cannot be laid aside.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David receives the sword of
the Giant Goliah from
the Priest, and eats of the
Shew-bread, because hee
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105632:71"/>found no other sword for
his defence, nor any other
bread for his sustenance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NEcessity enforceth him,
she sometimes makes that
lawfull which at all times is not
so: It is a shield, which being
ill used, workes the ruine of the
world. All misdeeds, how hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
soever, doe withdraw
themselves out of the danger of
the Law, and in stead of being
condemned to be borne withal,
are invested with the cloake of
necessity: there is no absolute
necessity in man, because he is a
free agent; if he suffer no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
violence, hee hath none
within him; those which wee
call necessities, and which wee
pretend that they free from the
Law, are made to be such by the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105632:71"/>
Law. They are necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
by supposition, having
a conditionall antecedent for
their foundation: But the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
that are not authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by the Law, have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence;
for otherwise, all the
actions of men should bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
seeing all might be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
by supposing a conditionall
antecedent before them, out
of which a necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
should arise by supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore it is not true
that necessity hath no Law, but
it is very true that the necessity
which hath no Law is onely
that which is an enemy to the
Law.</p>
            <pb n="138" facs="tcp:105632:72"/>
            <p>
               <hi>David flies to King Achish,
but seeing himselfe and
his vertues knowne, being
much afraid of his envie,
he faineth himselfe to bee
mad, and changeth his
countenance before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE that is borne into this
great Theatre of the
world, ought to know how
to suit himselfe into sundry
habits, that hee may bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
in this Comedy to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
many persons. When a man
sees himselfe persecuted by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
hee must like the shelfish
fructified by the dew of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
cast away his pearle rather
than bee a prey to those that
have him in chase. <hi>David</hi> puts
on a forme of madnesse, and by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105632:72"/>
it brings <hi>Achish</hi> to put off his
envie. The countenance of the
former is transformed before
the eyes of the latter, not that
the effigies of the one is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but the intellect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
If it had pleased the Lord
by his mercy and benignity to
root up envy out of the world,
how many <hi>Davids</hi> would change
their countenances in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of <hi>Achish?</hi> But they that
hate valor and vertue, let them
(I beseech them) tell me what
thing it is they thinke they
hate, they hate even them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Vertue cannot bee odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
if it bee good, it is faire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so;
if it be faire, it is the object
of love, and not of hatred. The
envious is an ignorant Painter,
or a malicious one; who in
drawing the vertue of others
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105632:73"/>
deformes it; either he takes the
perfections from it, or addes
imperfections to it, and blames
in another that which himselfe
hath added of his owne to it, or
what he hath taken from it. Yet
this were not much, if he did
not also expose that picture to
publike view, that they who
cannot see the originall, might
hate it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take away David out of my
presence, saith Achish;
Have I any need of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THis King is one of those
that when the time comes
shall call themselves fooles, for
having beleeved wisemen to be
fooles: I know not which error
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105632:73"/>
to bee the greater, either to
thinke wise men to be fooles, or
to account fooles to bee wise
men: of this ignorance as out
of a root arise all precipitated
courses. The most dangerous
person that is represented, and
the greatest foole that can bee
found, is he that takes upon him
to be wise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David departs thence, and
saves himselfe in the cave
of Adullam, where his
brethren and all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house come unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS a foraigne warre is the
onely remedy to unite
the disordinate minds in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealths, so are enmities
and persecutions to make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105632:74"/>
in families. This is a
true rule when the discords are
not bloody, and when procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
no farther than to some
high tearmes, they are not
growne to hatred.</p>
            <p>Those brethren that in a sort
would have hindered the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of <hi>David,</hi> are they which
now are willing to helpe him
in his misery. Base mindes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
our felicities, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
us in our disasters; but they
that are onely corrupted by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
retaining yet a kinde of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity,
when their envy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
springs from desire of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
than malignity, they run
readily to assist their allies in
their dangers: and if they goe
not to applaud them in their
glory, it is not for that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
not to see them great, but
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105632:74"/>
because they themselves would
gladly be great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The malecontented also ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together to David,
and made him their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is impossible but there
should bee some such kinde
of people in a State. If the
Prince be good, then the evill
are malecontent; if he be evill,
the good are: and some that are
not displeased with the Princes
government, are so with their
owne, by which being ruinated
and wasted, when they have no
hope in quiet courses, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
nothing but turbulencies.
The state ought to beware of 2.
most potent enemies, Hope and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105632:75"/>
Despaire, for these two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
are they that molest it,
the greatest and the least of
quality; the one supposing that
their good fortune calleth them
to a better estate: the other by
their evill one are stirred to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the worst: for this cause I
suppose was that City prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a profest politike Writer
which is inhabited by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
sort of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Prophet Gad adviseth
David to depart, &amp; to goe
into the land of Iudah,
and Saul hearing that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
was seene there, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
greatly amongst
his servants, that David
being not able to give
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105632:75"/>them vineyards nor hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
nor make them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
nor otherwise
reward them, should finde
followers and he be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PRinces do erre when they
thinke their Rebels should
not be followed in hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
I speake not of <hi>David</hi>
who was a King and no Rebell,
one that was raised up, and not
risen against his Prince; one
that was flying from him, and
not contending against him.
The rewards expected of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
are farre greater than
those that are yeelded to fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And what doe not they
promise, which promise that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105632:76"/>
which is none of their owne?
what doe they not give before
they bee well advised that it is
their owne? Disordinate minds
are not content with ordinate
rewards: their troublesome
heads account quietnesse their
enemy, and even those of a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
disposition doe sometimes
surfet of rest, because the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
desire of change makes feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
it selfe to be tedious.</p>
            <p>The Subjects serving their
Prince, if they wil be rewarded,
oftentimes are driven to shew
some excessive merit, because
there are few that thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
bound to those whose ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is bound to them: but hee
that followes a rebell, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
merited of him in that he
followeth him. That false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that to worke where
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105632:76"/>
one is obliged diminisheth his
merit, is both pernicious to
Princes, and prejudiciall to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
The obligation rather
increaseth the merit, seeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is due to the Subject, not
onely for that which hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
performeth, but for his
future actions which hee hath
obliged himselfe unto. The
stranger that doth somewhat
for the Princes service, gives
him onely some fruit of his
owne tree, whereas the Subject
hath given him the tree it selfe
with all the fruit.</p>
            <pb n="148" facs="tcp:105632:77"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Doeg the Idumean answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
Saul, that hee saw
David when hee came to
Achimelech the Priest,
who gave him besides vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,
the sword of Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah;
the King sends to call
him, and questions him
thereabout. Hee who the
truth being knowne, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
reward rather than
punishment, doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
himselfe as not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but speakes with that
confidence which rather
proceeds of innocency than
temerity, saying, And
who is among all thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105632:77"/>
more faithfull than
David the Kings sonne in
law, and readier to doe all
thy Commandements? nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is this the first time
that I have prayed the
Lord for him. Farre bee
the name of a rebell from
me. I thought I had done
service to thee, in doing
service to thy chiefe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe subjects of the Tyrant
that hath an inward Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
are intang<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed in streights
inextricable. Let them looke
for ruine at all hands, if they
hate him when he is exalted, or
if they love him when he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105632:78"/>
yet what errour doe they
commit in loving him, but that
their Lord doth the same? He
cannot finde fault with others,
unlesse he first condemne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
and he deserves the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
chastisement, because hee
ought to have greater adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement,
in considering who
he is whom hee exalts above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
It is not the part of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to examine the actions of
their Soveraigne: It is their
glory to second them; and yet
it is not sufficient to obey the
commands of a Tyrant, if wee
diue not also into his secret
thoughts. Hee that seekes to
search into them, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
(as it were) guilty of death;
he that doth not, easily becomes
liable. He embraces sometimes
such a one as he could be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105632:78"/>
were made away by his subjects,
hee dissembleth for his proper
interest, yet permits not others
to doe so for theirs. If his
thoughts were alwayes bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the prosperity of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
hee were a wicked subject
that did not bend himselfe
wholly to his service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul commands Achimelech
and all the Priests of Nob,
to be slaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Who have found elsewhere
that the same proceeding
which provoked <hi>Saul,</hi> had pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
a Tyrant, should wonder
at the diversity of the effect,
had it not beene produced by
the innocency of <hi>David,</hi> who
left <hi>Achimelech</hi> no place to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105632:79"/>
himselfe without condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the King, not onely of an
oversight as it was in the other,
but even of ingratitude, perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnesse,
and cruelty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul saith, kill Achimelech
and all the Priests, but
no man stirreth; hee bids
Doeg kill them, and hee
presently obeyeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe voice that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in generall, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not with so much sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as that which is directed
to some particular. The divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of it into so many eares,
makes so many divisions, that
it becomes diminished in every
of them. The rewards as also
the punishments which are in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105632:79"/>
common, come but slowly, but
the private are as soon obtain'd,
as they are deserved: Hee that
would chastise generall errors,
or would reward the merits of
all, as those of some particulars
are; on the one side hee would
destroy the world, and the
empty treasuries on the other:
And therefore as in the great
errors of a multitude, the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portio
decupla</hi> is observed, so
likewise in such great benefits,
the like decimation is used, if
not some greater proportion.
Whence it comes that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are more easily wrought on
to doe well, and with greater
difficulty to doe evill the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
because their feare and
hope of chastisement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is greater.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Saul goeth afterward to Nob,
where he killeth small and
great, as well of the one
sex as of the other, as
well men as beasts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF that City had beene culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and <hi>David</hi> a rebell, <hi>Saul</hi>
perhaps had taken no ill course,
that being the first and onely
place. That Prince is sometimes
the most pious, which upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
is most severe: his cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is deepe, but not large, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if it be intensive, it is not
extensive. It is true that where
many Cities have rebelled, the
using of greater in the first that
is taken, doth not dishearten
the rest, but makes them despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and obstinate in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to their last breath. It is
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105632:80"/>
such an antidote as is not to be
ministered to all that are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abiathar a son of Achime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech
escapeth out of Nob,
and commeth to David,
who afflicts him greatly,
saying that he is the cause
of the death of so many
persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THis is an intolerable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
because three most
potent affections are the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of this griefe, and inforce
the revenge: The character of
friendship melting the heart,
the pricke of honour which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindles
it, and finally the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
which excites it. To defend
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105632:81"/>
our friends is so profitable for
the maintaining and increasing
of Monarchies, that they which
have beene held to bee most
prudent have endevoured it,
even in places far remote from
them, not to receive aid or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but onely to helpe and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
them: hee that knoweth
not how to make use of this
rule, knoweth not how to rule.
The greatest Rulers and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
of the world have made
themselves great by this Art;
yea this colour is so pleasing,
that it dazleth the eyes of the
people, and maketh them often
applaud such a one, as under
the colour of defending his
friends, brings himselfe into
the estates of others: but if hee
finde great resistance there, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himselfe unable to offend
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105632:81"/>
those whom he would have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
hee oppresseth them
whom hee should have defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Word is brought unto David
that the Philistims had
invaded Keilah, and spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it: He askes counsell
of the Lord, whether hee
shall goe against them;
who answers him, that he
shall goe, overcome, and
defeat them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE that will learne the way
into matter of State, let
him but observe <hi>David,</hi> let him
not enterprise with fraud, but
with valour: Let him not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
his hands with civill blood,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105632:82"/>
but with that of the stranger;
nor offend those whom hee
would have to bee his subjects,
but defend them. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
that most men grow
great by fraud; not because
it is more safe than valour,
but because it is more easie;
whence it comes that there are
many fraudulent, but few that
are valorous: notwithstanding
the greater part even of those
that by fraud have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters, in seizing on the
Country in which they were
borne, have first manifested
their valour either in enlarging
or defending it. To defend the
subjects of others, is to touch
the finest string of State and
Dominion; if the Lord grieve
at it, he seemes ungratefull; if
he suffer it and say nothing, he
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:105632:82"/>
is in little safety. The Subjects
are not to be defended by any,
but their owne Prince: It is
his proper office. He that arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
it to himselfe, if hee bee
not already, hee will be in the
Princes roome. The wisest
Common weales have not been
ignorant how much this point
importeth, declaring that they
knew it for a matter of much
consequence, and of maine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
when they would not
permit the Subjects themselves
to bee the defenders of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <pb n="160" facs="tcp:105632:83"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul understanding that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
is in Keilah, prepares
to goe and besiege him;
which he foreseeing, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
Abiathar to enquire
of the Lord whether Saul
will come or no, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
he will. Then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they of Keilah will
deliver him into the hands
of the King, and hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
they will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe destruction of <hi>Nob</hi> had
made the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> so
ungratefull, as that they would
have delivered him into the
hands of his enemie, who had
but at that instant delivered
them out of the hands of their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105632:83"/>
enemies. Gratitude workes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great effects in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
mindes, and the greater
when it hath brought forth: It
is then surely prevailing over
private interest, yet must it of
force give place unto feare, to
which all the passions give way,
I meane in State affaires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
none of them can be used
when wee thinke our selves to
bee thereby endangered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they cannot be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised:
It hath beene disputed
whether the Prince or the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are more ungratefull. I am
of opinion that there is ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
everywhere to be found,
if our being gratefull cannot be
without losse of our lives; yet
rather in the people than in the
Prince, because it is easier to
finde one man than many, to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105632:84"/>
sacrifice his life to his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But if the question bee of
augmenting or diminishing the
State, I hold Princes to bee the
more ingratefull, because their
interest is very great; and that
of the people howsoever it bee
in their entire body as great, is
but small notwithstanding in
every particular: whence it
comes that men more easily
part with a little, though in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it be much, than one man
alone with much, which in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
would be but little.</p>
            <pb n="163" facs="tcp:105632:84"/>
            <p>
               <hi>David departs into the desart
of Ziph, to hide himselfe
in the wood. Saul heares
of it, and followes him in
vain: But Ionathan goeth
to him, comforts him, and
saith, he is assured that he
shall reigne over Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SEe here the force of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which makes <hi>Ionathan</hi>
reioyce that <hi>David</hi> is to take
the kingdome from him. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that friendship seemeth to
be without interest, yet is it not
altogether without interest.
The affection that we beare to
our selves, is the rule of all our
affections. They who have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that a friend loveth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more than himselfe, have
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105632:85"/>
haply beene deceived, for if
sometimes a man loseth his
life, his goods and estate for his
friend, it is not in regard that
he wishes more good to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than to himselfe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he acknowledgeth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
goods but vertues, which
he gaineth, when gloriously for
his friend hee forgot those of
fortune. But they that love ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
their estate and their life
above vertue, when they saw
some forgoe their goods (which
they so much esteemed) for
their friend, were easily induced
to thinke that they loved not
themselves so much as their
friend.</p>
            <p>I was never of opinion that
it was any imperfection, to love
himselfe above others, but have
rather esteemed it an imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:105632:85"/>
not to love himselfe more
than others. He that erreth not
in this, shall never offend; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he that sinneth, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God as much as he can, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth
himselfe, or as much as
he may: seeing that all his good
is depending on the goodnesse
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Ziphines give notice
to Saul that David had
hid himselfe in their
woods, and they conduct
him where he is: David
finds himselfe out of hope,
seeing himselfe encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
round about. But
Saul is advertised by a
messenger, that the army
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105632:86"/>of the Philistims was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SInners many times have no
recourse unto God, but in
their utmost extremity, and
many times God delayeth the
deliverance of the faithfull to
prove them, and then hee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them: but those other are
seldome delivered out of their
dangers, but they returne eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones
to their misdoings. He
suffers them to returne thither
whence their feare had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne
them, which departs as
soon as he hath delivered them.
To reserve himselfe from ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his friends till they bee in
extremity, is a thing well befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in God, who can helpe
whensoever hee will, and then
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105632:86"/>
willeth when it is best; but in
men that have no power accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their will, it is perilous.
When it moves not to dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
yet it diminisheth the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and most commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
ingratitude. There is a
kinde of proceeding put in ure
(yet not alwayes with good
successe) by Potentates when
they have received some disgust
for the satisfying of two affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
their anger and their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
to suffer those that have
given them distaste, to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
but not to bee opposed.
This course is rather to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
with enemies, and may
prove well when the enmity
proceeds not of emulation, if
at least that act doe not lift him
up to a higher spheare. It is a
difficult thing for a corrivall not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105632:87"/>
to be alwayes an enemy, when
such emulation hath one dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
into hatred: and when
he ceaseth to be an enemy, hee
will cease also to be a corrivall,
either having passed into a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
degree, or being so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
himselfe. Though <hi>Saul</hi>
were more enraged against <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
yet he leaves pursuing him
to goe against the <hi>Philistims,</hi>
with whom he hath more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
Physitians doe sometimes
not onely not asswage a griefe,
but suffer it also to grow; whiles
they cure, a putrid fever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
Hee is very unwise, that
for the healing of a part is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of the whole, which when
it dieth, the part dies with it.</p>
            <pb n="169" facs="tcp:105632:87"/>
            <p>
               <hi>David being retired into the
holds of Engaddi, Saul
returnes to pursue him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in rockie places, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vanquished the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims,
and entering into
a Cave for his necessary
businesse, hee hapned into
the same, in which David
and his men were hid;
where they perswade Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
to kill him, but hee is
contented onely to cut off a
lap of his garment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO kill the chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of an army, if hee
be gracious with it, when hee
that killeth him hath not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
army, is the revenge of a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105632:88"/>
private person to discharge his
passion of hatred, but not of a
Prince that desireth dominion.
The army is thereby incensed,
maketh presently another chief,
thinkes to revenge the losse of
their Prince, hateth the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
and is more ready to die
against him, than serve under
him. <hi>David,</hi> who was in the
way to the Kingdome by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uetude
and fortitude, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with the feare of God,
and by consequence a reverence
toward his King, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd humility
withall, could forgoe those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and take to him revenge
with irreverence and cruelty,
without losse of reputation. He
that is come forward with one
vertue, ought rather to die than
to change it: there are some
who having gotten reputation
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:105632:88"/>
by one manner of proceeding,
cannot alter it, because it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
to them; others will not,
because they have prospered
with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and those ought never
to change, whose demeanour
hath ever beene vertuous. That
power which is rising, because
it riseth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly by the meanes
of reputation, must beware of
losing it, and preferre it even
before life, for therewith all its
good is lost. Politicians have
esteemed this rule to be so true,
that they have made it an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
one, and will have a
Prince rather to hazard his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
and life, than to lose by
meanes of Peace, Truce, or
tribute his reputation. I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
not to their opinion, yet
doe I agree, that if the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a Prince consist in his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105632:89"/>
reputation, hee ought rather to
die than to lose it; but if it be
founded on store of money and
people which are his subjects,
let him yeeld to the time, make
peace and truce ever, though
it bee with disadvantage of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
let him become tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary,
though it be to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
nation, and leave not any
thing undone how meane so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
(so it be not against Gods
Law) rather than to adventure
his estate; for any thing is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than to put that in jeopardy.
If that be not lost, it is never out
of season to recover whatsoever
is lost: Its prudence in Princes
and no infamy; they ought not
to abhorre any thing that may
augment or maintaine their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.
Private men write such
weake rules, because they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105632:89"/>
them by their owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe:
Every degree of men
hath his proper and peculiar
kinde of reputation differing
each from other, so farre forth
that many things accounted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
in one degree, are well
reputed in another. A Prince
that hath a great estate never
loseth his reputation, if he lose
not his estate, for his estate is
his reputation. The world is in
a confusion in such sort, that
men of one degree leaping into
that of others by confounding
the divers degrees, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
all the world. The
Merchant will take upon him
the Gentleman, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
the part of the Prince;
the religious, that of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier;
and where the reputation
of the one consists in suffering
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105632:90"/>
and forgiving of injuries, hee
leapes into that of the other,
whiles he seekes to require and
revenge. I am to be excused if
I am long in this matter, which
is the cause of great errours in
the world; for if every one
would follow his owne profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
it would soone be knowne
that reputation consists in
knowing well how to performe
his owne profession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David being on one side of a
mountaine, seeing Saul on
the other, calleth unto him
and sheweth him his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
assuring him of his
good will, complaineth
that he is persecuted, but
blameth the Kings Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105632:90"/>and not the King
himselfe. Saul hearing
that malice is imputed to
his servants, doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
himselfe by them, but
layeth the fault on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is an ordinary thing of
male-contented men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
though not of the Prince
himselfe, yet of his Ministers.
That when <hi>David</hi> doth here
out of modesty, is done often
by others out of subtilty. To
rise against the government,
makes the name of a rebellion
the lesse odious, deceives the
people, yea, many times, the
Princes themselves for a while,
who sometimes discerne not at
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105632:91"/>
the first the ambition that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
masked under discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Princes ought therefore
to have their Ministers about
them of singular goodnesse, and
of tried prudence, that upon
the first rumor they may be wel
assured of the falsehood of such
complaints, and breake the
heads of such horrible Serpents
at their first appearing. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
that the people beare
toward the Prince is so great,
that it would be a difficult thing
to stirre them up against him,
but by first beguiling them; and
though it bee all one to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the government, and to
rebell against the Prince, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
either the Prince is hee
that governeth, or hee that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes
is the Princes Minister)
yet it appeares not at first with
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:105632:91"/>
so foule a face. It is true indeed
that an insurrection of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is occasioned by a bad Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
in which case the Prince
doth alwayes amisse to chastise
him. In the people there is not
alwayes one desire covered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
another, but if the great
ones arise against the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is not because they are
not well governed, but because
they would be governors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
to satisfie their demands
were to consent to lose the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,
seeing such will not
bee satisfied, till they obtaine
it.</p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:105632:92"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel dieth, hee is buried
with honour, and is by
the people most tenderly
bewailed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Know not whether mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for the dead procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
of piety, or of meere inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest:
It may favour peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of piety to bewaile when
hee dieth, but not after hee is
dead: who would not have
compassion of his friend, while
he sees him, or imagines tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with the grievous ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of death. Men are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in very great paine, for they
are in the paine due to a very
great fault: And who would not
after rejoyce to see him depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
victorious over humane
frailty, and to triumph over
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:105632:92"/>
death it selfe, without having
left any other spoyle in that
conflict than his body, and that
for a very short time?</p>
            <p>To lament the dead (if one
may say) is then most impious,
when it seemes most pious: and
then ought most to bee done,
when it seemes not due at all.
The death of the righteous, at
which wee ought to rejoyce,
makes us to mourne; and that
of the wicked, which we ought
most to lament, doth rejoyce
us. It is no friendly but an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
part to be grieved at the
death of that friend, whose life
may make us beleeve that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes
his deserved glory. But
it is a part of piety to be sory at
their death, whose wickednesse
doth make us doubt that they
are cast headlong into hell.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105632:93"/>
The world is so full of snares
that the good should not desire
to bee in it, because there they
may be corrupted; and so great
is the mercy of the Lord our
God, that the wicked should
desire to bee therein, that they
may be amended. But if we are
grieved in regard of our owne
interest, is it not more available
that our friends pray to God for
us, than to men? He that thinkes
he hath lost his friend when he
dieth, if he beleeve the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the soule, and doth not
thinke him damned, must then
beleeve that the Characters of
his vertues are lost with God.
O how true it is that all our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
doe spring and grow from
our muddy senses! They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
no interest but ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
no happinesse but worldly;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:105632:93"/>
and albeit man is elevated by
his better part unto a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
knowledge, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
desire it as hee ought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he cannot know it as it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David went unto the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of Rachan, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that there dwelt
neere thereabout a man
exceeding rich in flockes
and other possessions, whose
name was Nabal; he sent
unto him on the day of
sheep-shearing, to demand
some reliefe of provision
and victuals: But Nabal
not onely denieth him, but
with ill words provoking
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105632:94"/>him, declaring his ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
to bee accompanied
with malice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is an ordinary thing in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
of benefits to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the deniall with injuries;
I know not whether it bee to
cloake their avarice with hate,
or because such men loving
their goods as deerely as their
lives, when one dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to have
any of them, are incensed with
anger, as if he sought so much of
their blood; or els that it comes
to passe, because men in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is demanded, thinke
they have made him their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that demanded it, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
him such in their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
speake of him not as
one that is become such, but as
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105632:94"/>
of one that is so already. Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
also <hi>Nabal</hi> denies with
arrogancy to accomplish <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
desire, doubting his guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
might seeme to bee some
signe that hee stood in feare of
violence, and to shew that hee
doth not feare it, himselfe in
termes begins to use it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David is incensed by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of Nabal, and sets
forward to destroy him and
all his house. But Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail,
Nabals wife, being
a prudent and a beautifull
woman, hearing of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids
request, and her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
deniall, goes with
many beasts laden with
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:105632:95"/>victuals to meet David,
and beginneth with excuse
of her husbands ignorance,
and foolishnesse. Shee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats
him to accept of the
present shee brought, and
pardon her husband: And
so David is appeased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WOmen are of so great
force in perswading,
that it hath beene held all one
to hearken to them, and to grant
their requests. He that forbade
them to bee brought up in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
had an eye perhaps not
onely to their difficulty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
but also to their
facility in perswading. He that
was judged by the Lord God to
be the wisest, made use of such
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:105632:95"/>
an instrument; and that tyrant
who was written among the
most circumspect, was afraid of
this force. Women have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
delight joined with their
words, and where delight is,
there is also perswasion. If the
understanding doth not agree
to it, the will consents: so that
when that which they say can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be believed, yet they which
have said it must not be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Their teares are their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymems,
their beauty is their
sword: where they doe not
procure love, there they move
compassion; yea, and sometimes
they perswade the better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have no skill in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading:
There is no cunning
suspected where there is no sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
yet there is more thereof
in their countenance than in all
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105632:96"/>
Rhetoricke. It is lawfull to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
all fiercenesse in favour of a
sex that is so amorous: The
weaknesse of it makes us not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to lay downe all our
wrath to it, yea, rather makes
him ashamed that doth not lay
it downe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David doth blesse God and
Abigail, for having by
her prudence diverted him
from revenging himselfe
of Nabal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is a great good hap to bee
taken off from a necessity of
revenging himselfe. Hee that
can divert it and doth not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth
great blame; hee that
hindreth it, great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and hee meriteth more
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:105632:96"/>
that desireth to be so diverted.
But there are many now a dayes
desirous of such necessities,
which if they be but small, they
seeke to augment them, and
faine some when they finde
none. They account it a glory
to revenge, and the name of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull,
glorious. This is a
proper art for those who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no talents by which they
make themselves knowne to be
men, will make themselves
knowne to be beasts; they know
not how to make themselves
honoured, therefore they will
make themselves feared, as if
reputation and feare were all
one. The vulgar rout breede
such kinde of people by applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them, but such applauses
turne to their ruines, seeing the
quarrels which beginne among
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105632:97"/>
the greater sort are for the most
part quenched with the blood
of the meaner. Cities will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be rid of these blood-thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
companions, till they cease
from commending their bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
proceedings, neither will
the way to such false praise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bee stopped up, till the way
to the true, shall be laid open;
which then onely will be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
when Princes and States
give place and occasion to their
Subjects to make knowne their
true valour, and reward them
according to their due deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Abigail returnes to Nabal,
and because she findes him
drunken, she forbeares till
the morning to speake unto
him, and then tells him
what had passed; which
when hee had heard, his
heart was dead within
him as a stone, and within
few dayes he dies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHy should <hi>Nabals</hi> heart
become dead, seeing
his offence was pardoned? or
rather why should not his heart
be dead, seeing hee had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
<hi>David</hi> doth not cast him
downe, it is only his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
Hee that offends his
neighbour unjustly offends his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:105632:98"/>
owne reason, and although his
neighbour hath pardoned him,
she never pardons him: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
taken of him, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberance
of his offences.
<hi>Nabal</hi> cannot beleeve that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
to be abolished, whose
characters being blotted out the
memory of men, are written in
heaven; for then are they
written there, when they are
strucke out here. He doth not
perfectly pardon, who doth not
pray God to pardon, which if he
doe, he doth not thereby dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, but in some sort
increaseth them. If the Judges,
whom the Holy Ghost calleth
gods, did resemble God in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of sinnes, as they desire
to bee like God in superiority
above others, there would not
be so much offending, and there
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:105632:98"/>
would be more pardoning. A
man hath no sooner forgiven
an offence, but the Judge also
pardons it; yea, sometimes also
the Judge hath absolved before
the party hath pardoned. That
savage fiercenesse of never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
an enemy would soone
be abolished, if their pardoning
did augment the offences in the
judiciary seats of men, as it doth
in a sort before the Tribunall
or high Justice of God. But
when the offended pardoneth,
the offences are written above,
though here being remitted
they are cancelled.</p>

               <hi>David taketh Abigail being

who was first the wife

            </p>
            <p>WHo desires to marry to
Beauty, may happe to

Devill also hath some beauty.
But he that desires to be joyned
with Prudence, if he marry not
an Angell, yet he is surely mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to an angelicall vertue.
Prudence is a fire which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
all Antimony into medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
makes her pleasing that's
deform'd, makes her tolerated
that is poore, and her quietly
enjoyed that is faire: for it is a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:105632:99"/>
Bezar that corrects the venome
of beauty; It makes it maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall,
and not lascivious, and
being majestical it is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the radiant beames of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
not of <hi>Venus;</hi> rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
reverence, than enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
desire. He that sees her,
conceits her a thing impossible
to obtaine, and the will never
fixeth upon impossibilities; if
it be not fixed it reflects on the
object, if it doe not reflect, it
loves not for the often reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

            </p>
            <p>SEe how the pride of <hi>Saul</hi> is
not mitigated with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
of <hi>David,</hi> perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the pride was joyned with
interest, and the humility with
reputation. The proud man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
meeke, not when his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
hath humbled himselfe,
but when hee himselfe hath
humbled him. That humility
that is begotten by feare, doth
ever mitigate the pride that is
not brutish: hee that beleeved
otherwise might haply have
beene deceiued, by confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the one with interest, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:105632:100"/>
the other with greatnesse of
minde. The proud man will
have his enemy bow unto him;
but if then when hee boweth
downe, his deeds lift him up, he
doth not mitigate, but rather
exasperate him, because insteed
of magnifying him, he doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
and confound him. All the
wise, yea, and wily men doe
humble themselves to him that
persecutes them; when their
humility encreaseth their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which it alwayes doth,
when seperated from dobilitie.
The greatest pride that may be
found, goes clad in the habit of
humility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and oftentimes is not
discerned by others, but him
onely against whom it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed:
and because by the rest
it is not discovered, they cannot
oppose against it without being

            </p>
            <p>WHen Princes conferre a
degree of honour on a
subject, they will make choice
themselves; but in a matter of
danger, they use to leave him
to his owne choice: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the subject thinkes to make
his merit the greater, by how
much it is the more voluntary;
the Prince on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
holds himselfe lesse obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

to avoid to bee beholding,
but to bee assured of the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
and love of the subject.
To expose him to danger and
to love him, doe not very well
agree. To make one to offer

is not sufficient argument
of such affection, if without

they that are well sighted may
discerne the hidden finger of
God, who when hee intendeth
the ruine of some house or

takes from it those that might
save it; or otherwise alters them
in such sort, that they oppose
not his designes: sometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
taking away the marke of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
things, hee sends an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
to burne Cities, to destroy
Armies, and raiseth up Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
that with the light of a

a lambe in suffering <hi>Saul</hi> to

God, who to the sinner was a
Lambe, and a Lion to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.
He that aimeth at a digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in shewing himselfe faint-hearted
in obtaining it, will not
prove couragious when he hath
obtained it. <hi>David</hi> did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to slay <hi>Saul</hi> for any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of State, but abstained from
it for the reverence and feare
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:105632:103"/>
of God. Where hath that man
beene found, that knew this
peece of policy at any time? It
is too finely wrought to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerned
by the eyes of those
that are blinded with the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of desire to rule or revenge,
untill having obtained the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
or the revenge they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
their eyes happily are
cleered; then they begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that which they should
have considered before, they
are afraid of the example which
themselves have begotten;
whence it came to passe that
many have revenged the death
of those Princes, of which
themselves have beene the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers.
They are terrified in
their seat of State, they hate
their Scepter, as if it threatned
violent death to him that treads
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:105632:104"/>
on it or hold it: They stand in
feare of the stars that rule over
that kingdome, as if the vanity
of those were true, as it is most
false; who have beleeved that
the violent constellations of
kingdomes, with a very little
helpe of the Kings Horoscope
had the power to kill them.</p>

            <p>HE speakes not of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
men, he knowes that
malignity may be extinguished,
but never appealed, and that no
other sacrifice doth extinguish
it, but the suffering of himselfe
to be extinct. He that practiseth
malignity is base, he that gives
eare to it is weake, 'tis not the
part of a prudent or a wary man.
It is a sword that is sharpe on

while he seekes to endamage
another, hee loseth his owne

to; and why they hearken
to him, and how this is wrought
I know not, neither will I teach
nor learne it: For I hold the

did contemplate the means of
the practice thereof, I should
accuse my selfe to bee guilty in

there is no returning. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

rise. The Angell fell, and
so did man, but the man retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into grace, and not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell;
because the nature of man
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:105632:106"/>

that of the angell. If a prince be

end in discharging and turning
him away, it is a signe of love.
We are very angry with them,
whom we love entirely. It is a
security of being a favorite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the anger which may bee
vented when it is not kept in
by feare, is entertained by love,
and is finally a confirmation of
the inward affection; being (as
one may say) a certaine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of matters, which being
kept in the Princes breast would
ruine the Courtier, and uttered
with choler, they call backe the

because he had her on his

the longer she hath lasted, the

is a precept which one shall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
finde written than obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
perhaps because the nature
of men which is in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters
to complaine of fortune,
in their good successe to boast of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:105632:107"/>
their owne worth doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to bee afraid of being

It may perhaps be found, if they
were examined, that they were
not printed with the stampe of
prudence, and so of no value,
because he that had them could
not utter them, or because hee
would have them goe for more
than they were worth. He that

to know him, because hee goes

th'other, they ran to know the
nativities of great persons: the
Princes belike thinking by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to enforce the senses, if at
any time they should raise up a
subject to reigne; yet they
droue them away againe, lest
others in the Princes nativity
should seeke out the time of his
death, or should seeke the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <hi>Saul therefore disguised with

to a woman having a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar

and excuseth her art,
for feare of the king; but
Saul swearing that no

up Samuel, as Saul

            </p>
            <p>TO seeke to know things to

devill, is a great error: to seeke it
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:105632:113"/>
by the stars, is sure a greater ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy;
by this men pretend a
scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, by th'other a revelation.
The one wee may yet know by
the permissive will of God, but
the other passeth our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
and hee that thinkes by
this meanes to know what is to
come, pretends also to be God,
for God onely knoweth the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without any revelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: But
perhaps there is no other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt these professions,
(setting aside the odiousnesse of
the name) saving that in the
one, men run voluntarily to the
devill; in the other, ignorantly.
Who knowes that those Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall
figures, are not as the
circles of Negromacers, &amp; that
those same signes, and those
starres have not a proportion
correspondent with their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:105632:114"/>
by meanes of which,
they bring the devill sometimes
to foretell what is to come, but
ever to deceive them? And if
perchance the devill is he that
doth by such arts reveale it, why
doe they seeke unto him? If to
get evill, it is a meere madnes;
if to get some good, it is to
much simplicity to beleeve that
the devill will bee a minister of
any good.</p>

of the sinnes of the
people and the people of those
of the Prince; the one in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting,

God chasteneth the people for
the Princes sinnes, not because
it hath demerited with them,
but because it hath so deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
It is true indeed that when
his Divine Majesty sends the

be like unto loves: as the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of enjoying a thing that is

the feare of it. <hi>Sauls</hi>
blood within him made some

reflecting on it with his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,

his feare, but hath nothing

            <p>INterest is of such force with

it is accounted weaknesse to
trust him, whose interest may

to doe in this case in matters of
policy: whoso presupposeth it in

any, is sometimes deceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and because he is sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivd,

or without some errour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

            <p>IT is not altogether impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to refraine nature a long
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:105632:117"/>
time, but it is so in the utmost
confines of possibility. There is
requisite thereunto a perpetuall
assistance of judgement; nature
is alwayes ready to move accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to her inclination, if shee
bee not alwayes with-held:
and if through headlesnesse or
wearinesse she bee left unto her
selfe, she fals like a stone to her
owne center. Here hence comes
that little truth which is found
in Astrologicall predictions, or
rather which wee make them
have; because our inclination is
a mover that continually wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in us, and doth not alwaies
finde a continuall resistance.
That which is violent is said to

            <p>LOe here a means how one
may lose his inward fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
with a Prince, and get
not his favour. The conspiracy
of great ones where they beare
great sway, undoubtedly either
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:105632:118"/>
doth ruine the favorite, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the state, whensoever hee
that is greatest with the Prince,
is not the greatest among them.
In such a case men would not
bee ashamed to bow unto him,
to whom though hee were not
the favorite, he ought to bow:
and there would be opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them a cleere way without
any dirty flattery, or thorny
danger, to run a happy course
betweene obsequiousnesse, and
odious liberty; but this seldome
or never happens: whether by
the cunning of Princes, or by
nature, I know not. This Art
teacheth them that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
in the state may not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into inward favour without
danger of dominion, from
which hee is but one pace di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.
Nature teacheth to lift
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:105632:118"/>
up the lowly, and to beat down
the mighty: and this nature is
dictated of God, who raiseth
the poore from the dunghill to
place him among Princes, even
with the Princes of his people:
It is signified by the starres,
whose radiation is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought
to be great, powerfull, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
which lifting men from
low estate, doth seat them with
Princes. It is finally manifested
in the earth, whiles it favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
cherisheth and raiseth up
those plants that are not wrapt
in gold, that is resplendent, but
buried in the basenesse of the
soile that is uncleane. What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
may then be give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites
for eschewing the hatred
of great ones? The wittiest po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician
seems to commend such
a subject, as contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:105632:119"/>
to bee the greatest of the
great ones in authority about
the Princes, cared not to exceed
the meaner ones in dignity: I
take this to bee want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
how to make ones best
benefit of the fortunes that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
one, or rather an abusing of
them: and that it is no way suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to extirpate envy, which
is rooted in favour, and not in
honour. How many have beene
seene to lose their favours with
the Prince, retaining still their
dignity; and of objects of envy
to become the objects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.
He that thinkes riches
and honours are envied, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
It is the command, the
applause, and obsequiousnesse,
that they bring with them: if
these were separated from the
King, it were no desirable thing
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:105632:119"/>
to be a King. A very small reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and a very little place, is
sufficient to satisfie what our
bodies require: but the whole
world is not enough to quench
the thirst of the minde; which
stands also with reason, because
the body may easily finde his
object in a bodily world. But
the minde which is a spirit, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
findes it where there is no
spirit. It deceives it selfe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in running with the body
after some bodily thing, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
a proper object; but no
sooner is the same obtained, but
the errour is discovered. Those
pleasing tastes which some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
sensuall doe account
but as smoake, which are the
obsequiousnes, the reverences,
the applauses, these are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
food to the minde, because
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:105632:120"/>
these are the least corporeall.</p>
            <p>There are a thousand other
precepts written for favourites,
both to defend them from the
hatred of the great, and from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
other occasion that might
worke their overthrow. Some
also I could adde which are not
mentioned by others, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are all vaine and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous,
I will not fill up the
page with such vanities and
weaknesses: I will say one only
thing, being the truest and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curest
course to maintaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the Princes favour,
which may well be performed,
and may well be spoken of; yet
can it not be learnd nor taught,
which is, to preserve alwaies the
love of the Prince, and the
manner how to preserve it. It is
true, that the favourite never
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:105632:120"/>
falls without some cause, but
the same causes have not alway
the same effects: for sometimes
they are surmounted by an
affection greater than their
owne; if this stands firme
and sure, there can bee no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
if this shrinkes, then the
ruine is at hand: not because he
falls without cause, but because
'tis impossible not to give some
cause, and then the lesser have
more force than at another time
the greater would. A constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
which would scarce have
caused a simple ter<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ian in youth
(by consent of those that write
these vanities in Astrology) is
sufficient to kill one in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit
age. He that would not
have his love decline, let him
hold both his eyes alwayes fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Prince, never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:105632:121"/>
from him, never seeke any
other but him; for as soone as
he turnes his eyes to himselfe or
others, he is undone. His great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
his affections, his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and delights, must be in
his Prince. Neither let him
thinke that by this meanes hee
may misse of preferments, but
rather that hee shall bee sure of
them, and peradventure with
lesse envy. Hee that possesseth
things that are subject to envy,
and takes no delight in them, is
rather to be pittied, than envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But who is he that will doe
so, saving the man that is full of
affection, and most tenderly
enamoured of his Lord. It is a
thing that cannot bee reduccd
into Art, though it bee easily
knowne. Affectation differs
much from affection, which if
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:105632:121"/>
hee hath not, let him not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate;
for such imitations are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
in the schoole of love:
they that will maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Princes favour with
Art, their Art failes them, and
they then faile with their Art.</p>

an instinct of nature; which
feeling the heart suffocated by

seekes to ease her selfe by

               <hi>They finally finde out the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites,
fight with
them, and overcome them;
recovering the prey with
the prisoners: and the spoile
which they had taken, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
will have divided
with those that kept the
baggage, and were not at
the fight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe Captaine of a male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
company, had need
bee both valorous, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect:
That heat that stirres up
a multitude, whether for love
to their leader, or anger against
their Prince, groweth soone
cold, and then gives place to a
comparison, to which succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
repentance; the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:105632:124"/>
whereof, is either the
killing of their Captaine, or the
abandoning of him: Neither is
it sufficient for the eschewing
of such a danger, to have once
gotten a great reputation: time
consumeth it, and how great
soever it be, reduceth it to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
It is necessary to linke it
into a chaine, not suffering the
report of a great action to cease,
without renewing it with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as great or greater. <hi>David</hi>
because his flying from <hi>Saul</hi>
might take from him the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
hee had gotten in subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Giant, no sooner begins
to flie, but hee fights and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Philistimes, that had
sacked <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eilah;</hi> and because that
flight is an argument of feare,
and that feare brings a losse of
reputation, he makes it knowne
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:105632:124"/>
that he could twice have killed
the King, to give his flight
the title of reverence, and to
take away the imputation of
feare. Afterward being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Ziklag,</hi> that the malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
might not have leisure
to make any reflections on him
to his harme; and desirous to
maintaine his reputation, hee
oftentimes with honour and
profit to himselfe assaulteth the
infidels; and finally vanquisheth
the Amalekites, and recovereth
that reputation, the diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof, had brought him
into the perill of being stoned.</p>
            <pb n="244" facs="tcp:105632:125"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The Philistimes fight with
the Israelites, and have
broken the body of their
army, and slaine three of
the Kings sonnes; the
strength of the whole char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Saul, when he turning
to his Armour-bearer,
prayes him to kill him,
that he might not be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision
to the uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
which when he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
Saul sets his owne
sword against his breast,
and falling on it, kills
himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Know not how the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of death to bee the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:105632:125"/>
of all terrible things,
should bee understood: If in
this life the utmost of all dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
things be not to be had,
why should the utmost of the
terrible? One of the contraries
cannot bee admitted, but the
other must also bee granted.
Now to live, not being the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of delectable things,
teacheth that to dye is not the
utmost of the terrible. The not
finding in this our world any
object that is the last of delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and of terrible things (if we
will not suppose the powers
without an object) makes us
beleeve that it is in the other
world, and in that other world
is God seene and not seene. But
he that described death the last
of all terrible things, meant it of
things in this world; which
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:105632:126"/>
would be true, if spoken of the
last in number, and not in
weight: for otherwise, if it be
such in it selfe, it must then be
alway such unto all: And yet
we read of many men that have
imbraced it, to eschew some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, which wee must
needs beleeve was more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to them. He that wonders
at a resolution so extravagant
as makes a man kill himselfe,
may marvell at nature also,
which being sometimes terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at death doth prevent it.</p>
            <pb n="247" facs="tcp:105632:126"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The Armour-bearer of Saul,
seeing what his Lord had
done, drawes out likewise
his sword, and kils him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Some Writers are of
opinion that this was Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eg
the Edomite, Sauls
favourite; who lest hee
should bee punished by his
successor, killed himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe favorites of a Prince
that hath a successour, if
they die not before <hi>Saul,</hi> yet
they die often with <hi>Saul.</hi> I
know not how to steere them
from this rocke: there hath
beene one, that seeing no other
remedy, made at the soveraignty
it selfe, and was just there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:105632:127"/>
There hath beene also
that turned his backe to the
West, and sate his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the East, and towards
those rayes that would have
beene deadly to him, had not
that Sun beene then under the
line of the <hi>Horizon.</hi> As the sons
of Princes cannot endure any
companion in domination, no
more will Princes in their love.
He that thinkes there is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
betwixt the father and the
son, is deceived. The honours
done to the sonne, if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
that of the father, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
him; but if they diminish
his, they make him sorrowfull;
which because it falls out but
seldome, men suppose there is
no such thing. When the favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
hath hope that by course
of nature hee shall survive
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:105632:127"/>
the Prince, it is a hard matter
for him not to have an eye to
the future; toward which if he
cast a look, he loseth that which
is present: but hee deserves no
favour, that desires or thinkes
to out-live his Lord. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
felicity that may befall the
former, (it being not lawfull for
any violently to charge upon
death) would be to end his life
just when the latter dieth. It is
hard to die before him, because
it is no easie thing to leave one
that is his Patron, and his Love.
He that blames Princes for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
favorites, would have
them inhumane and vile: What
thing is a man that hath no
love? or wherein may a Prince
shew gracious unto others, or
see himselfe his owne greatnes,
but in advancing of others? and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:105632:128"/>
how or why should he advance
them, if he doth not love them?
Would they have him alwayes
masked? would they not allow
him any, to whom he may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip
himselfe, and discover the
secrets of his heart? He that will
give to Princes (that which sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they ought to have) leave to
descend sometimes from their
throne of Majestie, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
their inward cogitations
with any one, hee must allow a
favorite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the Prince lay aside
his Majestie, withall he would
grow contemptible; if his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
should bee imparted unto
many, they could not bee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets;
but if he be familiar but
to one, open but to one, hee is
then the favorite. It is wished
by them that are not beloved
above the rest, that the Prince
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:105632:128"/>
would love all alike: but why
should he love all alike, since he
is not beloved himselfe of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like?
A well devoted subject
ought to bee grieved that any
one loveth his Lord more than
he, and not that his Lord loves
another more than himselfe.
This would bee a desire to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize
over the affections of
Princes, which men ought to
reverence. He that could make
his love more fervent, than that
of the favorite, might perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
make himselfe the
greater favorite: but common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men strive to unhorse him by
malice, and not by vertue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is more easie to envy,
than to love. Give me leave al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
further to affirme (if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence I may) that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be any blame to have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:105632:129"/>
unlesse men will say that
Christ our Lord was to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
whose favorite was Saint
<hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>One passing by chance neere
unto Saul, who longed to
die, and asked him whence
he was; and the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
that hee was an
Amalekite: Saul prayeth
him to kill him, which hee
excuseth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O The unspeakable provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God! he perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
permitted not <hi>Saul</hi> to
kill himselfe, he consented that
his sin should kill him. One of
the Amalekites, whom against
the will of God hee had saved
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:105632:129"/>
alive, God will have to put him
to death. That sinner spoke for
al sinners, &amp; spake divinely, that
said, My sin is alwayes against
me. We have no enemies, but
we make some: nor is <hi>Saul</hi> alone
slaine by his sinne, for there be
but few men that are not also
killed by theirs. And it is very
particular, that one particular
should kill them; seeing it was
the same that brought death
into all the world: O how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
and how profitable are the
precepts of God! He is a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian
(under favour be it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
not onely for the soule,
but for the body also. He hath
left us better rules in a few
leaves to preserve our health,
than are contained in the great
volumes of the bookes of the
Gentiles.</p>
            <pb n="254" facs="tcp:105632:130"/>
            <p>
               <hi>King Saul dieth after he had
reigned many yeeres, and
with the King, dieth a
great part of the people,
which had demanded a
King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FAvours are not therefore
demanded of God that he
may doe them, but because he
will doe them; hee doth them
by meanes of our prayers: they
are obtained with the Optative,
not with the Imperative mood.
Hee that will command them,
deserves then only to bee heard
when it is to his harme; to have
beene heard to teach him that
is God, neither to bee taught,
nor to be commanded. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then it was that <hi>Saul</hi>
did lose his life, and wherefore
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:105632:130"/>
the Kingdome of Israel went
out of his Progeny, is easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
by them, who omitting
the manifold other causes, have
recourse to that alone, which
is the first, and chiefe, and
prime cause: from whose well,
all the rest proceed. But why
God willeth the destruction of
Kings and Kingdomes, would
bee easie also to shew, were it
not the will of God, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
effective, but sometimes
also permissive: Hee wills that
such as forsake him, lose their
kingdomes; and that they that
follow him, obtaine them.
Moreover, how and when it
comes to passe that hee permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
sometimes those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him to be abased, and those
that abandon him to bee exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I doe not know, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:105632:131"/>
peradventure know as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
Those Princes then that
are not in Gods favour, let
them alwayes feare, how pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
soever they are: Being
not able to alledge any cause
of their happinesse, they must
needs be afraid; if they be great,
they know not why they are so:
and it is to be doubted that such
greatnesse cannot long endure;
whereof no cause can bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for which it began. He who
hapning to come into the house
of a fortunate man, did sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depart thence, certainly hee
meant it not of them that God
maketh happy and successefull,
but of those whom God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
so to be. The ruine of
<hi>Saul</hi> came peradventure of his
owne great prosperity, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from a base estate exalted
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:105632:131"/>
to a kingdome, confirmed and
setled therein with happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
in stead of making him the
more devout, made him more
confident, yea, more rash and
unadvised. Let us not make it
lawfull to serve him the lesse,
who hath prospered us to the
end; wee should serve him the
more, as if the gifts or graces
which God vouchsafeth us were
but for our pleasure, and not
for his glory. A great sort of
men offend their God in their
prosperity, and pray unto him
in their adversity; yet is hee
still the same God, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth
us out of misery and
distresse, and when he overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
our fortunate courses and
proceedings. It may seeme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
that to deliver out
of disasters doth more manifest
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:105632:132"/>
the Divinity, than to abase pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
fortunes; whence it is
that men are more confident in
his mercies, than fearfull of his
vengeance. There is no man
how wicked soever, but doth
some good thing whereunto he
afterward ascribes the cause of
his good successe, and equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
betweene the reward,
and the grace given him, hath
no feare of losing what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to have deserved. On the
contrary, there is no man so
good, but he committeth some
evill whereunto for the most
part he attributeth the cause of
his misfortune, and equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
betweene Gods chastising
and his exercising of him, sends
up sometimes his supplications
to God, when he should rather
have sent thanksgivings; as if
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:105632:132"/>
the world which is the place of
meriting and demeriting, were
the place also of rewarding and
punishing.</p>
            <p>To conclude, let us pray his
divine Majestie, that he will be
alwayes pleased to end the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
of the <hi>Davids,</hi> with
the death of the <hi>Sauls:</hi> And all
to the glory and honour of his
great Name; in which I
end this Booke, as I
desire also to end
my life.</p>
