            <title>A short relation of some words and expressions that were spoken by Barbara scaife in time of her sickness, a little before she departed this life she was betwixt fifteen and sixteen years of age, daughter to William and Issabel Scaife of the Blacksike near Appleby, in the county of Westmerland: in profession of the principles of light and life in Christ Jesus.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>A short Relation of some words and expressions that were spoken by <hi>Barbara Scaife</hi> in time of her Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, a little before she departed this life: She was betwixt fifteen and sixteen years of age, Daughter to <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Issabel Scaife</hi> of the <hi>Blacksike</hi> near <hi>Appleby,</hi> in the County of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland:</hi> In profession of the Principles of Light and Life in Christ Jesus. Which those People commonly called <hi>Quakers</hi> do bear Testimony to, and had fellowship with, from their Child-hood, and had a Care upon them to bring up their Children in the fear of the Lord, and in the knowledge of that Truth which they had believed in: and which their Children were in their tender age truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe following expressiions were delivered from the said <hi>Barbara</hi> in the presence of divers persons her Parents also being with her for the most part, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time they were spoken by her.</p>
            <p>And are given forth in honour to that Truth whereof none need be ashamed, but for the Blessing sake that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the same, may be encouraged to take their part therein, (whereunto also the aforesaid Damsel upon her dying bed hath testifyed) and may be of service to all young people to love and fear the Lord, in the dayes of their oyuth, that their lives may be comfortable to them, and their latter end peace, and their Memorial blessed for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:38025:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>The thirtith day of the first Month, 1686 was the said <hi>Barbara</hi> taken with sickness, and her Sister <hi>Mary</hi> also, both of them beginning therewith in one and the same hour. The distemper proved to be the small Pox, <hi>Barbara</hi> the first week of her distemper was sorely loaden therewith, but bore her exercise very quietly.</p>
            <p>The first of her words as relating to her inward state be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Lord and her own soul that were taken notice of. She delivered on this wise: <hi>Mother</hi> (said she) <hi>suffer but few of those People that come to see us to stay in the Parlour, but when they have seen us: desire them to go into the house, for we have no need of such empty talk, as is used amongst too many we would be quiet that we may pray to the Lord to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us the faults we have committed, and if he spare us our life at this time I hope and do believe we shall amend and have a care of displeasing the Lord while we live:</hi> After which words she spake very little for four dayes time.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d about the seaventh day of her sickness and the sixt of the second Month: She asked where her father was, her Mother told her he was at the Plough, she said <hi>Let some call him in: for I believe I must leave this world shortly:</hi> And after a little time, she begun to pray to the Lord with a very clear voice in a Miraculous Manner, saying. <hi>O Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God I cry unto tbee, and beseech thee blot out all my Transgressions. O Lord and all my sins. O let them come no more into thy remembrance. I beg it of thee in the name of Christ Jesus with all my Soul, and with all my strength: and let thy fafourable countenance be upon me:</hi> Thus she pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a wonderful heavenly frame, desiring the Lord also to make her passage sweet unto her by his consolating spirit, and that he would satisfie and enable her Parents so to bear it: as that they might not offend the Lord, and that he he would confirm and strengthen her weak Sister to give up
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38025:2"/>
her self freely, as she blessed God she her self had done. She prayed to the Lord to give her a Mansion place in his favourable presence: and that no more might be laid upon her Parents then what with Patience they might be enabled to bear.</p>
            <p>She continued her supplications to the Lord for about three quarters of an hour, to the admiration of those that were present with her: and several being there that did not profess the Light and Truth: which she testifyed to, and dyed in, were broken into tenderness to the shedding of many tears, and said <hi>how can any dye better then she is like to do.</hi> The said <hi>Barbara</hi> called her Brother to her bedside, and she fastning her eyes upon him said, <hi>Brother</hi> John, <hi>be faithful to the Lord and thy Religion: and it may fall out that when thou art a Man, the wicked Persecutors may hurry thee into Prison for the Testimony sake thou hast to bear, be sure thou do not regard that, but keep faithful to the Lord and he will deliver and be thy Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She exhorted her Parents not to trouble themselves with too much of the worlds concerns. <hi>But</hi> (said she) <hi>Let that to some which you have here (it beng a Remote place) and go to live near some good Meeting:</hi> Sedbergh <hi>Meeting if you can: if my Sister and I be both taken frm you: and take my Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> John <hi>with you and bring him well up I desire you, and be all of you content:</hi> And one that was not of the same profession which her Parents and she were of, being then present, asked her if she could freely part with Father and Mother, Brother and other Relations. She answered saying, <hi>I can freely part with and leave them all, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of that comfort and happiness which my soul is made sensible of:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She prayed again unto the Lord with praises also in her mouth unto him magnifying also the riches of his grace and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38025:3"/>
goodness, for the comfort she had received from him, to her Immortal Soul: at another time, her Mother endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to get her to take some meat. <hi>I desire thee</hi> (said she) <hi>do not trouble me with meat, for if you think thereby to keep me, it is all in vain, for I must die and leave you: Neither would I desire to live for all the world: For to be with the Lord is better then ten thousand worlds, with whom I shall rest for evermore, even with God and his Saints, his faithful People and Servants, the Sons and Daughters of the upright, glory to his Name for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At many times duriug her sickness she manifested un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable love to her Father and Mother, and to her weak Sister, touching whom she said to her Mother, <hi>do not stay with me what ever may befal me, but go to her and abide with her, for I do desire that too sharpe sickness may not fall on her, until she know her peace with God:</hi> She said again: <hi>Dear Mother do not sorrow for me, and perswade my <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e longer kept from that Heavenly rest which the Lord hath prepareed for me, with the redeemed of our God for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> Then her Brother coming to the Bed side, she said to him, John <hi>be true to the Lord and love him with all thy heart and with all thy Soul, all thy life time: And love not the World nor the pleasures thereof, for the enjoyments of this World are in comparison nothing: they are scarce seen till they are gone: but that which is enjoyed with the Lord is for evermore, praises, praises, to his name saitb my soul for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time she told them, she had only the River of her dissolution to pass through her mother asked her if she saw over it, she said she did see over it, and that she should joyfully pass it into the rest, where all sorrow &amp; tears should be wiped from her eyes for evermore glory and honour to our God for ever:</p>

               <hi>MAry Scaife</hi> elder Sister to <hi>Barbara</hi> of whom in the forgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relation mention is Made to have been taken with Sicknes the very same hour that her Sister was: And concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom Her Sister <hi>Barbara</hi> had been very tenderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd and exercised in her Spirit for her in Supplications to God to give her the knowledge of her peace that hath no end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who lived but about two weeks after her Sister, <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er distemper also of the small Pox, was accompanied with a Feaver; so as that she got very little sleep for several dayes Which made her extremity the greater. But in the Lords time who keepeth Covenant and shewes mercy, and giveth the Spirit of Supplication and prayer to them that believe: opened her Mouth in a clear understanding: <hi>And</hi> (said she) <hi>O great God Jehovah of Heaven and earth whose splendour filleth Heaven and thy Wonders filleth the earth: have mercy upon me thine handmaid. Who am as a Worm before thee, yet part of thy creation, Lord help my weak soul, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive my drooping Spirit, by thy consolating presence, streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then my faith I beseech thee, and help me through this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, I pray tbee O Lord. That thy Will may be done in earth as it is in Heaven:</hi> After this manner with many other ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der expressions she continued in Prayer for about halfe an hour, but her Sister <hi>Barbara</hi> being very weak at that time,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38025:4"/>
more of her words could not be so taken as to insert them here in writing, But often she prayed to the Lord to make her willing to give up her self freely, if the Lord required it of her, She desired the Lord that if there was any thing in her that did offend him, he would manifest it to her before her weakness became greater: Her Sister <hi>Barbara</hi> who in Supplications to God had waited for the consolation of her weak Sister, was abundantly comforted, because of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and comfortable frame her Sister <hi>Mary</hi> was brought into, and praised God on her behalf with much refreshing satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction upon her Spirit, as she manifested amongst such as were present with her.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Mary</hi> often prayed to the Lord in a tender sense upon her Spirit and in much fervency of Soul, as the living exercise she she was under did demonstate. She had been much inclined from her youth to read the Scriptures. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then about 18 years of age. And in her sickness after the Lord opened her heart &amp; mouth to shew forth his praife, she often spoke of <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and of Gods Love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to them, and other of his servants in Ages past. <hi>And now</hi> said she, <hi>I do know Gods Love to be the same to me as it was to them: So that</hi> said she, <hi>I am neither afraid nor unwilling to die, for God blotteth out my transgressions, and layeth nothing to my charge, and I do believe there is a place prepared for me in Heaven:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Dear Mother</hi> said she, <hi>do what thou canst not to sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, my Love is great to thee, and my advice is, that you go to live near some good Meeting and bring up my Brother amongst Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And her Sister being dead she spake of her own death also, and said she was well satisfied that her soul should ascend up to God in Heaven, <hi>Where</hi> said she, <hi>I do believe my Sister</hi> Barbara's <hi>soul is ascended to rest with the Lord for ever.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:38025:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>Then afterwards her Sickness encreased and weakness grew upon her, being attended with many violent Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion Fits, so that she could not speak to be understood, but sometimes to say <hi>John</hi> to her Bother: but very low and weakly for about two dayes hefore her departure: Her Sickness continued upon her six weeks and three dayes and she departed this life, the 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> Month, 1686.</p>
            <p>In her Life time she was very obedient &amp; respective to her Parents from whom she said she was not inclined to go for preferment, but would be content with the like condition as was alotted them. She was also very careful of her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good, of a sober behaviour from her Childhood, all her dayes loved the Truth and such as feared the Lord her latter end was comfortable and satisfactory to her; of great refreshment to her Parents, for which an ingagement lives with them ever to submit to God, and Praise his Name who is Worthy for ever.</p>
