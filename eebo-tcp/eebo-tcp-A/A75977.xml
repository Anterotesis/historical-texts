            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have entred upon a matter hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of, but not diſagreeing with truth; boldly I have done it according to my abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but not without ſome bluſhing: It is to deſcribe the Nobility and Excellency of the Female Sex; I doe confeſſe boldneſſe with ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'dneſſe hath often ſtrived within me; For as I did think it a thing full of ambition and boldneſſe, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the innumerable Praiſes, Vertues, and higheſt Excellencies of women; So it did ſeem as a childiſh modeſty of wit to prefer women before men: Hence I alledged an Argument, wherefore none hitherto (as I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know) have dared to exalt the eminency of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men above men, when very few dared to write ſo much as concerning their praiſes. Therefore I did thinke it a thing full of ingratitude to be ſilent, even as to envie, and rob ſo deſerving a Sex of its moſt juſt, and due praiſes; ſo that while I did ſtick perplexed within my ſelfe amongſt theſe various and diſſonant opinions, I was made more bold in writing, with this wonderfull fear of ingratitude, when as indeed I ſhould have been more bold, had I ſuppreſſed ſuch a truth by my ſilence. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then but interpret it for a good omen, as if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of this matter had been left and decreed to me
<pb facs="tcp:117398:3"/>
from above, which hitherto the multitude of learned men ſeem utterly to have neglected. I ſhall freely therefore declare the glory of women, and their accompliſhments I ſhall not hide; in doing which, far be it from me that I ſhould be aſhamed of the argument taken in hand, that if I prefer women before men, I may think I ought to be diſpraiſed for this, as ſcarcely I can beleeve that I ſhall be excuſed, who have compoſed a matter ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime with a lower forme of ſpeaking then ought to be, except the ſtreightneſſe of time, difficulty of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and juſtneſſe of the cauſe did defend me, as alſo, becauſe I have entred upon this worke with no deſire of flattery or aſſentation: therfore I have not ſo much ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adorn my words with Rhetorical fictions, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious lyes for praiſes; as to ſhew the matter it ſelf by <hi>Reaſon, Authority, Examples,</hi> and by the teſtimony of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> and of both <hi>Lawes.</hi> To you, moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Margaret</hi> (whoſe other part amongſt the moſt famous women of this age through the whole world, <hi>Apollo, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana, Dies, Aurora, Vulcan,</hi> five gods have not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illuſtrated, as well for your Nobility of birth, as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your Actions) I appoint this worke: therefore devoted, and dedicated, that the luſtre of your Sex may ſhine forth in you, as in a Sun, who hath aſcended to the higheſt degree, becauſe you have exceeded whatſoever hath bin blazed abroad concerning the praiſes of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Sex, <hi>both in Life and Manners</hi> by a preſent example, and a moſt faithfull witneſſe of the ſame Sex.

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1.</note> Firſt of all therefore, That I may begin the Matter, The Woman is ſo much the more excellent then the Man, by how much the more excellent name ſhe receiveth above him; for <hi>Adam</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Earth,</hi> but <hi>Eve</hi> is interpreted <hi>Life,</hi> by how much then, <hi>life</hi> it ſelfe is more excellent then <hi>earth,</hi> ſo much <hi>woman</hi> is to be preferred before <hi>man.</hi> Neither is there cauſe, wherefore it may be ſaid this Argument is weak, to judge of things themſelves by names; for we know that the great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator both of Things and Names, knew things before he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them, and his Wiſdome, which cannot be deceived, therefore framed Names that they might expreſſe the Nature, Property and Uſe of things. That there is truth, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, and ſignificativeneſſe in ancient Names, the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes witneſſe: Therfore from names, an Argument both with Divines, and Lawyers is of great moment: As concerning <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> we read in Scripture, according to his name, <hi>He is a fool, and fooliſhneſſe is with him.</hi> Hence <hi>Paul</hi> in the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> going about to ſhew the excellency of Chriſt, uſeth this Argument, ſaying, <hi>He is made ſo much better then the Angels, by how much he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name then they:</hi> And elſe where, <hi>He hath given him a name above every name, that in the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, of things in earth, and things under the earth.</hi> Add hereunto, no ſmal force and power doth ariſe to both Laws, from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of words, from the ſignification of words, from condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, demonſtrations, and diſputations of that kind, nay, even from the heads and titles of both Lawes. So in Law we well argue from the interpretation of a name, from the force of a word, alſo from the Etymology of a name, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Etymology, and order, and the placing of words. For the Lawes themſelves doe not a little look into the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of names, that ſomething they may collect from thence. <hi>Cyprian</hi> againſt the Jewes argueth the firſt man to have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  </gap>.</note>Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South: and in the ſame book he expoundeth the ſame name <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe the earth is made fleſh, although ſuch an expoſition differeth from the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe it was written by the Hebrewes, not with four, but with three Letters; notwithſtanding this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in ſo holy a man is not altogether to be diſpraiſed, who had not learned the Hebrew tongue, which very many Expoſitors of holy Writ are ignorant of, without much blame.</p>
            <p>Now if the ſame licence may be indulged to me, that I may according to my fancy frame a like Etymology of <hi>Eve</hi> in praiſe of the Female Sex, they muſt give me leave to ſay this one thing, from thoſe myſtical Symbols of the Cabaliſts, that the name of woman hath more affinity with that unſpeakable four-letter'd name of the divine omnipotency, then the name of man, which agreeth with the divine name, neither in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, neither in figure, neither in number. But to paſſe by theſe, for they are read by few, underſtood by fewer, and they require a larger narration, then can ſuite with our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. In the mean while, we will finde out the excellency of women, not by Name onely, but by Realities, by Offices, and Merits. We will ſearch the Scirptures, and take our riſe from the beginning of the Creation, and diſcuſſe what dignity ſhe hath obtained above the man. In the firſt order of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, we know, whatſoever are created by God, differ in this, that certaine of them perpetually abide incorruptible, certain are ſubject to corruption, and mutation; and in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating theſe, God proceeded in this Order and Method, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the more noble of the one, that he might end at the nobleſt of the other: therefore he created firſt the incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Angells, and ſoules: For ſo <hi>Auguſtine</hi> contendeth, that the ſoule of our firſt parent, before the production of the body, was created together with the Angells. Moreover, he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted incorruptible bodies, as the Heavens, Stars, and Elements, which I call incorruptible, although they are liable to vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous changes, out of which he made all other things, which are ſubject to corruption, ſo by aſcending through every degree of dignity, from the more vile, proceeding to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117398:6"/>
of the Univerſe. Hence firſt were brought forth Minerals, after Vegetables, Plants and Trees, next the ſenſible plant, <note place="margin">Gen 2.</note>at length ſenſible creatures, in their order, creeping, ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, flying, and going upon four feet. At laſt he created two like himſelfe, the Male firſt, and then the Female, in whom the Heavens and the Earth, with all their ornaments are perfect; for the Creator comming to the Creation of the Woman, he reſted in her, as the moſt honourable of the whole Creation; and indeed in her is concluded, and conſummated the whole Wiſdome and Power of the Creator; ſo that beyond her there is not to be found nor imagined a more excellent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Since then, Woman is the laſt of all Creatures, the end, and complement of all the works of God, and the perfection of the Univerſe it ſelfe, who will deny her to be moſt worthy of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence? without which the world, now indeed abſolute, and perfect in every degree, had elſe been imperfect, which not otherwiſe, then in the perfecteſt of all creatures could have been perfected: for it is erroneous, and abſurd to thinke that God ended his daies of Creation in an imperfect work: For ſince the world was created of God, as a moſt intire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act circle, it was neceſſary that it ſhould couple and unite the firſt of all things with the laſt. So woman while the world was created, was the laſt in time of all things were created, but in the divine Idea, and Conception was firſt, both as well for Authority, as Dignity. As concerning her it is written by the Prophet, <hi>God elected her before the heavens were created, and fore-elected her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is the common opinion of Philoſophers (that I may uſe their own words) That the end is alwayes the firſt in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and laſt in execution. But the woman was the beſt work of God, brought in of God into this world, as the Queen of it into a palace prepared for her, adorned, and decked in all reſpects; deſervedly therefore, every creature, loveth, reverenceth, and obſerveth her; deſervedly, every creature is ſubject, and obeyeth her as their Queen, being as the end, ſo the glory, and perfection, of all the works of God. Wherefore the wiſe man ſpeaks concerning her, <hi>He glorifieth the Nobility of the Woman, having fellowſhip with God;</hi> and above all, <hi>the Lord loveth her.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:117398:6"/>
How much alſo in reſpect of the place, in which the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was created, ſhe excelleth man, the holy Scriptures plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie, in that the woman was formed in Paradiſe (being a moſt Noble and moſt pleaſant place) with the Angells; when as the man was made in the ordinary field, out of Paradiſe with bruit creatures, and afterwards, for the ſake of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be created was brought into Paradiſe: therefore the woman by eſpeciall, and extraordinary priviledge of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it were accuſtomed to the higheſt place of her Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, although looking down from high, is not giddy, neither doe her eyes dazle, as it is wont to happen to men. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, if it happen, that a woman, together with the man, be in danger by waters, all outward helps being laid aſide, the woman longer ſwimmeth above the water, when the lumpiſh man preſently ſinkes to the bottom,</p>
            <p>That the dignity of Place, maketh to the Nobility of a man, both civill Laws, and holy Canons, do abundantly confirm: and it is the general obſervation of all Nations, not only of men, but of every animate creature, yea, and inanimate alſo, That by how much more worthy ſoyl they draw their originals from, by ſo much the more generous they are counted. Wherfore <hi>Iſaac</hi> commanded his Son <hi>Jacob,</hi> that he ſhould not take a wife in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but from <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> being in better condition. Not unlike to this is that in St. <hi>John,</hi> which <note place="margin">Joh. 1.</note>
               <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid, <hi>We have found Jeſus the ſon of Joſeph of Nazareth.</hi> Nathaniel <hi>ſaid unto him, can any good thing come out of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed to other Arguments. The woman excelleth the man in reſpect of the matter of which ſhe was made, which <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note>was not dead, and vile clay, as mans was, but a purified ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, enlivened, and endued with a ſoule; yea, a rationall ſoule, participating of the divine mind. Hereunto I ſhall adde, that man was made of the earth, which of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (heavenly influences co-operating) produces living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of all kinds. But the Woman, (above the influences of heaven, promptitude, and potentiality of nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of ſecondary cauſes,) was made by God alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all things like unto him, intire and perfect; man looſing but one ſingle rib, of which the woman was formed, to wit, <hi>Eve</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:117398:7"/>
of <hi>Adam</hi> ſleeping, and that ſo deeply, that he did not feele, when it was taken away; which God taking from the Man, gave to the Woman: Man therefore is the worke of Nature, but Woman the Artifice of God. And therefore, for the moſt part, Woman is more capable of divine ſplendor then Man, and often is found full of the ſame, which may eaſily appear, from the ſerenity and pulchritude, with which ſhe is, even to wonder, bleſt. For ſince beauty, is nothing elſe but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine light, and ſplendor ſhining through faire bodies, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly hath choſe to dwell in, and fill with it, Women rather then Men.</p>
            <p>Hence the Body of WOMAN is moſt delicate to the eye, and touch, her fleſh moſt ſoft and tender, her colour bright and luſtring, Skinne cleare, Head comely, Locks faire, haire ſoft, ſhining, and long, her Countenance maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke, Aſpect pleaſant, her Face ſurpaſſing in beauty, necke milke white, fore-head high, eyes ſparkling with a lovely chearfulneſſe, mixt with tenne thouſand graces; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them, eye-browes ſmooth and thin, divided with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent diſtance, from the middle of which deſcendeth her noſe, ſtreight and of due proportion, under which is her mouth neat, round and lovely, with ſmall, freſh, and red lips, within which her teeth appeare when ſhe gently ſmiles, being very ſmall, and evenly placed, overcoming Ivory with their whiteneſſe, and to whom they are fewer in number then to man, becauſe ſhe is not given ſo much to eating, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. About them her jaw-bons riſe handſomely, and cheeks of a tender ſoftneſſe, a roſie brightneſſe, and full of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.</p>
            <p>Next, take view of her round and dimpled Chinne, in a pleaſant manner, under which the neck is placed, which is ſmall, but ſomething long, fairly erected upon her round ſhoulders, a delicate throat, white, and of an indifferent thickneſſe, her voice ſweet and pleaſant, her breſt ſomewhat large and prominent, adorned with two <hi>Nectar</hi>-fill'd Paps, the roundneſſe of which, doth ſuite and agree well with the roundneſſe of her belly, her ſides ſoft, back ſmooth, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, armes ſtretched out, hands ſmall and ſlender, fingers <gap reason="illegible" extent="3+ letters">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117398:7"/>
her legs more fleſhy, the tips of her hands and feet ending in a round orbicular compleatneſſe, and every member ful of juyce and moiſture.</p>
            <p>Adde to theſe, her compoſed gate, modeſt deportment, graceful motion, gallant carriage, beſides the order, ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, figure and habitude in all parts moſt ſpecious, that I may ſay, there is no creature ſo admirable, no wonder ſo to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and that no man, except he be blind, cannot but ſee God himſelfe, what pulchritude ſoever the univerſal world is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, to have heaped upon women, to the end that every creature might ſtand amazed at her, love, and reverence her, as we ſee by experience, that incorporeall ſpirits doate upon women with moſt ardent affections, which is ſuch an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved truth, that none I think dare offer to deny it.</p>
            <p>And that I may omit that, which Poets manifeſt to us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Loves of the gods, and their Paramours, as of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and his <hi>Daphne; Neptune,</hi> and his <hi>Salmonea; Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> and his <hi>Hebe; Jole,</hi> and <hi>Omphale,</hi> and of the Miſtriſſes of other gods, and more then many of <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The holy Scriptures in many places highly commend beauty in women, above all other gifts and graces: hence it is read in <note place="margin">Gen. 6. Gen. 12.</note>
               <hi>Geneſis, that the Sons of God, ſeeing the daughters of men, that they were fair, took them wives of all they would.</hi> We read alſo of <hi>Sarah Abrahams</hi> wife, that ſhe was a fair woman to look upon, above <note place="margin">Gen. 24.</note>all other women in the Land.

               </note> We read concerning <hi>Judith,</hi> whoſe beauty the Lord increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much, as in beholding her, men were ſtruck with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. <note place="margin">Din 13.</note>We read concerning <hi>Suſanna,</hi> which was raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly delicate and beautifull.

If we read the hiſtory of holy Virgins, truely wee cannot but admire their wonderfull beauty, and ſpecious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> form before other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men: But above all, both far and near, as the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Princeſſe of all, ſhines forth the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt, at whoſe beauty the Sun and Moon ſtands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, from whoſe glorious countenance, ſuch a luſtre of chaſtity and holineſſe floweth, as that it was able to dazle the minds of all men, no man for all that, at any time through the temptation and inticements of ſo ſtupendious a beauty, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the leaſt thought.</p>
            <p>Theſe, although more largely ſet downe in the holy Bible, where ſo often mention is made concerning beauty, I have <note place="margin">Num. 31.</note>related almoſt in the very words themſelves: by which we are given plainly to underſtand that the beauty of women, not onely with men, but with God is eſteemed, and hath its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Therefore we read in holy Writ, that God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded every male child to be ſlaine, but the fair women to be ſaved alive. In <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Deut. 21.</note>to chuſe themſelves Wives out of the fair women captives.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117398:8"/>
Beſides this admired beauty, alſo, the woman is endowed with a certaine grace of comelineſſe, which happeneth not unto men. For the hairs of women grow to ſuch a length, as that they may cover thoſe parts of the body, wherein there is leſſe comelineſſe. Of which parts it is not neceſſary at this time I ſhould treat. Onely this I ſhall ſay, that in wonderfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency Nature hath ordained theſe in women, being not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as in men, but biding within in a more ſecret, and ſure place.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Nature hath afforded women more modeſty then men: Wherefore often times it happens that women, being diſeaſed with the dangerous Ulcer in the ſecrets, they have rather choſen death, then to ſubmit themſelves to the ſight and handling of a Chirurgeon, that they might be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And they retaine this grace of modeſty not onely liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but dying, yea, and alſo dead; which appeareth cheifly in thoſe, which periſh in waters. For as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, and experience teſtifieth, the woman lyeth with her face down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, nature ſparing the modeſty of the dead, but the man ſwimmeth with his face upwards. To theſe may be added, the worthieſt member in man, by which we differ chiefly from bruits, and ſhew forth the divine nature, is the head, in which head, the chiefeſt part is the countenance: the head in men is deformed with baldneſſe, the woman contrariwiſe, by a great priviledge of Nature, waxeth not bald. The countenance moreover in men, is often times ſo ſoiled with a moſt odious beard, and covered with naſty haires, that they can ſcarcely be diſcerned from beaſts; in woman contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the face alwayes abides pure, and comely. Hence there was in the law of the twelve tables, that women ſhould not ſhave their cheeks, leaſt when a beard ſhould bud forth, their modeſty might be hid: and it is to all for an argument of the cleanlineſſe of women, that when a woman is once cleanly waſhed, as often as ſhe waſheth afterwards in cleane water, the water receiveth not the leaſt foulneſſe: but man when he hath been waſhed often times very clean, he muddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſoileth the water.</p>
            <p>Moreover, by the ordinance of nature, women through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places every moneth expell their ſuperfluities; but mens
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117398:9"/>
are continually expelled through the face, the moſt comely part of the body. Furthermore, ſince amongſt all other liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creatures, it is given only to man to look with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance erect towards heaven, Nature and Fortune have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected woman cheifly in this, and are ſo propitious, that if by chance ſhe falls, ſhe almoſt alwayes falls upon her backe, and ſeldome, or never on her head or face. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing which we may not omit: Do not we ſee that in the procreation of mankind, nature preferreth women before <note place="margin">Gal. 2. <hi>de ſperm.</hi> 14.</note>men? which is cheifly perſpicuous, becauſe the womans ſeed alone, as <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Avicen</hi> ſay, that is the matter and nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the child, not the mans, becauſe it entreth into the woman as an accident into the ſubſtance. For, as the law ſaith, that is the greateſt and cheifeſt office of women, to conceive, and to nouriſh the thing conceived; for which cauſe we ſee that many are like their mothers; becauſe they are procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the blood of them: and that holds alſo very much in the habit of the body, alwayes in the manners; if the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be fooliſh, alſo the ſons are fooliſh; if the mothers be prudent, the ſons are prudent. But contrary wiſe in fathers, if they be wiſe, for the moſt part, they beget fooliſh children, and fooliſh fathers wiſe children, provided alwayes, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be wiſe. Neither is there any other reaſon why Mothers love their children, more then Fathers, except that, becauſe the mothers are ſenſible they have more of their owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, then the fathers; for the ſame cauſe alſo, I think it is naturall to us, to be more affected towards the mother, then towards the father; ſo as we ſeem but to affect the father, but paſſionately to love the mother. And therfore nature affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to women milk of ſuch a ſtrength, which doth not only nouriſh infants, but alſo reſtore them being ſicke, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo when they are grown up, may ſuffice for ſaving of life. The experiment we read in <hi>Valerius Max.</hi> concerning a young maid of the common people, which by ſuckling nouriſhed her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Priſon; when otherwiſe, ſhe was condemned to have <note place="margin">Val. <hi>l. 5.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi> Ariſt. l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anima lib. Eccl. l. <hi>26.</hi>
               </note>periſhed with hunger: for which piety of hers, life was not only given to the mother, but a ſettled maintenance to both; and the priſon was afterward dedicated to the goddeſſe Piety. For it is moſt commonly ſeen, that the woman is more full of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117398:9"/>
compaſſion and piety then the man, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives as <note place="margin">Ariſt. l. de animal. <hi>Eccleſ. 26;</hi>
               </note>proper to the Female Sex. Wherefore it is I think <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>where there is not a woman, the ſick languiſheth;</hi> either becauſe by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving &amp; aſſiſting ſhe is of wonderful dexterity towards the ſick, and alſo full of chearfulneſſe, or elſe becauſe womans milke is a remedy to the ſick, and weak, and to them that are next neighbours to death, by which they are reſtored to life. Hence Phyſitians report, that the heat of their paps applyed to breſts of old men, ſtricken with extream age, exciteth, increaſeth, and confirmeth vitall heat in them. Which thing <hi>David</hi> was not ignorant of, who choſe <hi>Abiſhag</hi> the <hi>Shunamite</hi> maid, in his old age to cheriſh him by her imbracements. Moreover woman is more apt then man, for that myſterious office of Generation, for that ſhe is ripe at 10. years and under, but he not many years after. And beſides, it is very well knowne that the woman alone of all fruitfull creatures, after ſhe is with child, and beginneth to bear in her womb; alſo not long after ſhe is delivered, inclineth to the foreſaid act again, whoſe veſſell is ſo affected to humane conception, that it is ſaid ſometimes without lying with a man, ſhe hath conceived. So <note place="margin">Averrois <hi>2.</hi> Collig.</note>that Naturaliſt hath delivered in thoſe his famous Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of learning, concerning a woman which conceived of ſeed that was ſpent in a Bath. To this may be added, another wonder of Nature, that a woman if being with childe, ſhee have longed, as wee ſay, without hurt hath fed on raw fleſh, raw fiſh, often times upon coales, loame, ſtones; alſo hath concocted metalls, poyſons, and many things of this ſort, and converted them into wholeſome nutriment: how great miracles, beſides theſe mentioned, Nature her ſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to produce in women; no man will wonder that hath read through the Volumes of Philoſophers and Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>I will lay down one notable example from them, which is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and at hand. And that is, that the menſtruous blood of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, beſides from quartan Agues, freeth them from Hydropho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, being a diſeaſe when one is extreamly afraid of water, from the Falling Sicknes, the Leproſie, Bruiſes, Melancholy, and Madneſſe, and other moſt pernicious Maladies of that kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many other things no leſſe, if not more wonderfull it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117398:10"/>
as that it quencheth great flames of fire, allayeth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, ſaveth from danger of drowning, driveth away what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is noxious, counter-works Witch-crafts, and putteth to flight evill ſpirits. Many more things they ſay, which is not my mind at preſent to urge. Yet this I will adde to the reſt, as a vantage, that there is in women, according to the traditions of Philoſophers and Phiſitians, which are proved by experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a divine gift, by which they by their own proper helps and benefits are able to heale themſelves in every kind of diſeaſe, without the aſſiſtance of any outward means.</p>
            <p>But that which goeth beyond all Miracles, being it ſelfe the greateſt Miracle is, <hi>viz.</hi> that Woman alone without man is able to produce humane nature, which in no wiſe is given to man; which things even by the Turks and Mahumetans is confeſſed; with whom, many are beleeved to have conceived without mansſeed, whom they cal in their tongue <hi>Nefeſol<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now what ſhall I ſay concerning ſpeech, a divine gift, by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117398:10"/>
which one thing we chiefly excell beaſts, which <hi>Triſmegiſtus Mercurius</hi> eſteemed of the ſame price he eſteemed immortality, and <hi>Heſiod</hi> names it the beſt treaſure of man: Now is not wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man more eloquent of ſpeech then Man, more terſe, and flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent? doe not we (all of us) learn firſt to ſpeak either from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Nurſes? truly Nature it ſelfe, the wiſe diſpoſer of all matters, in this hath wiſely provided for women, that ſcarce at any time you ſhall finde a woman dumb; It is a glorious thing then to excel men, in that by which men chiefly excel o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther living creatures.</p>
            <p>But from prophane, let us returne to ſacred writ as by re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, and let us begin the matter from the very fountaines of Religion. We know in the firſt place without doubt, that God bleſſed the Man for the Womans ſake; which benediction for as much as Man was unworthy, he deſerved not to have, before the woman was created. To which is conſonant that <note place="margin">Pro. 18. Eccle. 26.</note>Proverb of <hi>Salomon; Who findeth a good Woman, findeth a good thing, and obtaineth a bleſſing from the Lord;</hi> And that of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticus, The Husband of a good Woman is bleſſed, and the number of their yeares are doubled;</hi> and no other man is able in dignity to be compared to him, which is worthy to have a good woman. For as <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſaith, <hi>A good Woman is a grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every grace.</hi> Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Proverbs calleth <note place="margin">Prov. 12. 1 Cor. 11.</note>her the <hi>Crowne of a Man,</hi> and <hi>Paul, the glory of a Man;</hi> but glory is defined, the conſummation, and perfection of a thing reſting and delighting in its own end, which is ſo compleate in it ſelfe, as that nothing can be added to make its perfection greater:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> The woman therefore is the Conſummation, Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Felicity, Benediction, and Glory of the Man: And as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith, the firſt ſociety of mankind in this mortality: therefore there is a neceſſity, every man ſhould love her, and who doth not, he is eſtranged from all vertues and graces; nay, I will ſay more, even from humanity. Hitherto might be referred thoſe Cabaliſticall myſteries, how <hi>Abraham</hi> was <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 28.</note>bleſſed of God by reaſon of a woman, <hi>Sarah;</hi> the letter <hi>H</hi> being taken away from the name of the woman, and added <note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note>to the name of the man, and he was after called <hi>Abraham.</hi> How <hi>Jacob</hi> had his bleſſing by a woman alſo, to wit his mother, who
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117398:11"/>
got it for him: There are many things in holy Writ of this kind, but not to be explained in this place: bleſſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note>is given for the womans ſake, but the law for the man; the law I ſay, of anger, and malediction; the man was forbid to <note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note>eate of the fruite of the tree, the woman not ſo, who neither as yet was created, when the command was given to the man: for woman God willed to be free from the beginning; the man therefore ſinned by eating, not the woman; the man brought death, not the woman; and wee all have ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> not in <hi>Eve;</hi> we have drawn originall ſin, not from <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>the Mother the Female, but from the Father, the Male; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the old law hath circumciſed every Male, and the Females abide uncircumciſed, ordaining originall ſin to be puniſhed in that ſex only which tranſgreſſed; neither did God accuſe <hi>Eve</hi> becauſe ſhe had eaten, but becauſe ſhe had given occaſion of evill to the man, and that unwittingly, by reaſon ſhe was tempted of the Devill: The man knowingly ſinned, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ignorantly, and deceived hath erred; for ſhe was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the firſt devill, who knew the woman to be the moſt excellent of all the creatures. And as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, the devill ſeeing her beauty to be admired, knowing her to be ſuch a one as he had knowne before, whilſt he ſtood, which above all <note place="margin">Bernard.</note>Angells had the fruition of God, he caſt envy againſt the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alone, for her excellency: Wherefore Chriſt was borne moſt humble into the world, that he might by his humility <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>expiate the pride of the ſinne of our firſt parents; he took the mans Sex as being more humble, he took not the womans Sex being more ſublime and noble.</p>
            <p>Moreover, becauſe we were condemned for the ſinne of the man, not for the ſinne of the woman, God willed, that by which Sex the ſinne came, in the ſame the expiation of ſinne ſhould be made, and the Sex which through ignorance was deceived, by the ſame puniſhment ſhould be made: Therefore it was ſaid to the Serpent, <hi>becauſe the woman,</hi> or which is truer read, <hi>becauſe the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe his head;</hi> not the man, neither the ſeede of the man. And hence it is that the order of Prieſt-hood is committed by the Church, rather to the man, then to the woman, becauſe every Prieſt repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſt; but Chriſt, the firſt man, being a ſinner, to wit <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:117398:11"/>
from this the Canon is underſtood which beginneth thus, This Image: that woman is not made to the Image of God, to wit, the corporeall image of Chriſt; for God willeth (I ſay) Chriſt to be the ſonne not of the man, but of the woman; whom he honoured ſo far, that he would put on the fleſh of woman alone, for in regard of the woman alone, Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſon of man, not in regard of the man. This is the great Miracle which the Prophet was very much amazed at, becauſe a woman compaſſeth a man; to wit, when the whole Sex of man is comprehended in a Virgin, and ſhe beareth Chriſt in her body. Alſo Chriſt riſing ftom the dead appeared to women firſt, and not unto men; neither is it unknown that after the death of Chriſt, men departed from the faith, but women (it is manifeſt) never fell away from the faith, and Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, no perſecutions for the faith at any time, no Hereſie, no Errour hath ever riſen from women: but otherwiſe it is concerning men, Chriſt is betrayed, ſold, bought, accuſed, condemned, ſuffered, was crucified; at length put to death, and all by men. Yea, he was denied of <hi>Peter,</hi> forſaken of the reſt of the Diſciples, accompanied of women alone to the croſſe, and to the Sepulcher. And the wife of <hi>Pilat</hi> a heathen did more indeavour to ſave Chriſt, then any of thoſe men, which had beleeved. To this may be added, that almoſt all the whole Schoole of Divines affirm, that then the Church abided not, except in one woman alone, to wit, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and for that thing deſervedly the Female Sex is called religious, and holy. Now if any ſhould ſay with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that the Males are more ſtrong, more wiſe, and more noble amongſt living creatures, the excellent Doctor <hi>Paul</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers this ſaying; <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and the weak things of this world God hath choſen, to confound the ſtrong, and the ignoble, and contemptible God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and thoſe things which are not, that he might deſtroy thoſe things that are.</hi> For who amongſt men, in all gifts of Nature was more eminent then <hi>Adam?</hi> but a woman humbled him: Who ſtronger then <hi>Sampſon?</hi> but a woman over-came his ſtrength: Who chaſter then <hi>Lot?</hi> yet a woman provoked him to inceſt: Who more religious then <hi>David?</hi> but a woman perverted his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117398:12"/>
holineſſe: Who wiſer then <hi>Salomon?</hi> but a woman deceived <note place="margin">Job.</note>him: Who patienter then <hi>Job?</hi> whom the devill ſtript of all his goods, killed his Daughters and his Sonnes, filled him with Ulcers all over his body; notwithſtanding he was not able to provoke him from his ancient ſincerity; but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (being in this ſuperiour, and of more power then the devill himſelf) provoked him to curſe. Yea, if it were lawful to call Chriſt himſelfe into theſe compariſons, then whom nothing is more powerfull, nothing more wiſe, ſince he is the eternall wiſdome and power of God; did not he ſuffer himſelfe to be overcome by the Woman of <hi>Canaan?</hi> he ſaying, <note place="margin">Mat. 15. Iohn 18</note>
               <hi>It is not good to take the childrens bread and caſt it to dogs.</hi> She a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain anſwered, <hi>Yea Lord, but the dogs eate the crums that fall from their Maſters table,</hi> and now, with reverence be it ſpoken, as it were overcome by this Argument, he bleſſed her, ſaying, <hi>Be it done unto thee as thou wilt.</hi> Who more ferventer in the faith <note place="margin">Mat. 20. Mat. 14. Luk. 22.</note>then <hi>Peter,</hi> the chiefe of the Apoſtles? a woman ſeduced him, not the leaſt Paſtor of the Church, to deny Chriſt. Let the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> ſay what they wil, that their Church cannot erre, but hath not the woman Pope, her name <hi>Joane,</hi> deluded it with an <note place="margin">Plat. de Joan. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note>egregious impoſture? but who ever ſhall ſay theſe things, more bend themſelves to the reproach of women, then to adde to their praiſes: To whom women in this manner ſhal anſwer, If there be a neceſſity that one of us make a loſſe of ſome good or life, I had rather deſtroy thee, then be deſtroyed my ſelfe; and that by the example of <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, who in his own Epiſtle decretall to a certain Cardinall, whom he ſent Legat for the <hi>Roman See,</hi> who left this in writing, <hi>If it cannot be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but that I, or thou muſt be confounded, I will chuſe rather to confound thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, the civill Lawes take that care of, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for women ſo, that they ſhall be ſure to have their right, although it cannot be without damage and injury to men. And in holy Writ, is not even the wickedneſſe of women com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and extolled oftentimes more, then men doing wel? <note place="margin">Gen. 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27.</note>Is not <hi>Rachel</hi> praiſed, which deluded her Father with a neate invention, when he ſought his Idolls?

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117398:12"/>
               <hi>Rhaab</hi> the Harlot did deceive thoſe that ſought the Spies <note place="margin">Joſh. 2.</note>of <hi>Joſhua, and it was accounted to her for rightèouſneſſe.

               </note>notorious betraying, ſhe was bleſſed among women, in her tabernacle.

And yet this woman therefore, was praiſed and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified: ſo then the wickedneſſe of woman is higher reputed then mans well doing. Did not <hi>Cain</hi> do well in offering the firſt of the fruites of the earth for a ſacrifice? and yet for that very thing he was rejected of God: And did not <hi>Eſau</hi> do well, while in a pious obedience he hunted after Veniſon for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit father? and in the meane time he was defrauded of the bleſſing, and hated of God: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> for his zeale to Religion, holding up the Arke ſliding, and almoſt fallen downe, was ſtruck down with ſudden death. King <hi>Saul</hi> for ſparing the fat beaſts of the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> although for a ſacrifice to the Lord, was deprived of his Kingdome, and delivered up to an evill ſpirit.

ſay, &amp; by as many examples (which all your Poetical helps are too few for) prove the contrary opinion, namely, <hi>that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe of a man is better then a womans well doing.</hi> Sure I am you cannot be able to defend that, except you run to blind Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories, where alſo the authority of woman ſhall be equall at leaſt with that of man.</p>
            <p>But let us returne, even this may be a moſt evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all, of the excellence of ſo happy a Sex, becauſe the pureſt of them, the moſt bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (as ſome divines affirm) without originall ſin. This is a ſtrong Argument of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> the beſt of which kinde is more noble then the beſt of the other kind, that kind is more noble then the other: In the Female kind the beſt is the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> in the Male kind <hi>there hath not riſen a greater then John Baptiſt,</hi> but how much the bleſſed Virgin, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above all the companies of Angels excelleth <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> no ſound Chriſtian can be ignorant of. In like manner, on the contrary, wee may argue, the worſt of which kind, is worſe then the worſt of the other, that kinde is inferiour <note place="margin">Mat. 14.</note>to the other: But we read of ſome men worſe then the worſt of women. We will not here diſpute whither he might bee <hi>Judas,</hi> that betrayed Chriſt, concerning whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It had been better for that man he had not been borne;</hi> or Antichriſt, in whom the whole power of Satan dwelleth. Furthermore, the Scriptures declare many men to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eternal torments, when no woman at any time condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may be read of: to this may be added in way of teſtimony a prerogative of brutiſh nature, becauſe the Eagle which is Queen of all Birds, always of the Female, never of the Male is found: &amp; it is ſaid, that there is but one only Phaenix, and that a Female, which is in <hi>Egypt.</hi> But on the contrary, of the Serpent, which hath its name from King, I mean the <hi>Baſiliske,</hi> the moſt poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous of all venemous creatures, there is none except a Male, which is impoſſible to be gendered a Female.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the excellency, vertue, and innocency of this Sex, even by theſe Arguments aboundantly ſufficient may be ſhewed, becauſe the riſing of all evills is of man, none of the woman, becauſe the firſt formed <hi>Adam,</hi> hee durſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the Law of the Lord, he hath locked the gates of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117398:13"/>
and hath rendred us all liable to ſin and death, for we <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note>all have ſinned and dyed in <hi>Adam,</hi> not in <hi>Eve:</hi> In like manner, the firſt begotten of him hath unlocked the gates of Hell, he was the firſt Envyer, the firſt Man-ſlayer, the firſt Parricide, the firſt deſpairing of the mercie of God; the firſt that had two Wives, <hi>Lamech;</hi> the firſt drunkard, <hi>Noah;</hi> the firſt diſcoverer of the nakedneſſe of his father, the ſon of <hi>Noah, Ham;</hi> the firſt Tyrant and Idolater, <hi>Nimrod.</hi> Man firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <note place="margin">Gen. 9.

            <p>We read of ſome men having two Wives for their goatiſh pleaſure; ſome more, ſuch were <hi>Lamech, Abraham, Jacob, Eſau, Joſeph, Moſes, Sampſon, Helcana, Saul, David, Salomon, Aſſur, Roboham, Abia, Caleph, Ahaſuerus,</hi> and innumerable others, which had each of them many Wives and Concubines; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther content with the uſe of them to fill their luſts, they have mingled themſelves with their hand-maides alſo. But on the contrary, we finde that no woman, except onely <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> but hath been contented with one man alone, neither ſhalt thou find any that had two husbands, if they had Off-ſpring of the firſt; for women are much more continent, by reaſon of their ſhamefacedneſſe and modeſty, then men; who, becauſe they have known themſelves unfruitfull (we read) that they have abſtained from lying with men, and to have brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Gen. 16. &amp; 19.</note>their Husbands ſtrange women, as <hi>Sarab, Rachel, Lea,</hi> and many others unfruitful, which have brought in their hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids to raiſe up poſterity to their husbands.

There are innumerable moſt famous women, who in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty &amp; conjugal love have excelled all men, ſuch as <hi>Abigal</hi> the wife of <hi>Nabal, Artemiſia</hi> of <hi>Mauſolus, Argia</hi> the wife of <hi>Polinices</hi> the <hi>Theban, Julia</hi> of <hi>Pompeius, Portia</hi> of <hi>Cato, Cornelia</hi> of <hi>Gracchus, Meſſalina</hi> of <hi>Sulpitius, Alceſte</hi> of <hi>Admetus, Hypſicratea</hi> of <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> the <hi>Pontic</hi> King, <hi>Dido</hi> the builder of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the <hi>Roman Lucretia,</hi> and <hi>Sulpitia</hi> of <hi>Lentulus:</hi> there are infinite others, whoſe immoveable Virginity, and chaſtity could not be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by death, examples of which offer themſelves, <hi>Atlanta Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidonia, Camilla Volſca, Iphigenia</hi> a Greek, <hi>Caſſandra</hi> and <hi>Criſe;</hi> to theſe may be added the <hi>Lacedaemonian, Spartan, Mileſian,</hi> and <hi>Theban</hi> Virgins, and innumerable others, which the hiſtories of Hebrewes, Greekes, and Barbarians number to us, who made Virginity of more account then Kingdomes, yea, then life it ſelfe: if now examples of piety be required, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers theſe offer themſelves: <hi>Claudia</hi> a <hi>Veſtal</hi> Virgine towards her father, and that mean <hi>Plebeian</hi> Maid, concerning whoſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affection to her Mother, we have ſpoken of before: But ſome <hi>Zoilus</hi> wil object againſt theſe, that there have bin deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive marriages &amp; which have made direful Tragedies, as thoſe of <hi>Sampſon, Jaſon, Deiphobus, Agamemnon;</hi> which if any wil ſee into with <hi>Lynceus</hi> eyes, he ſhall find that wives are falſely accuſed; none of which at any time have proved bad to a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, for there were never ill Wives, but to ill Husbands; to whom although they ſhould prove good, oftentimes they are corrupted with the vices of their husbands.

            <p>Let us ſearch the holy Scriptures, and we ſhall ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of women in faith and holy duties, commended far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove men, as <hi>Judith, Ruth, Heſter,</hi> which are mentioned with ſo <note place="margin">2 Chro. 22. 2 Chro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34.</note>much glory, that they give names to bookes in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe, who for his eminency of faith, the Scripture hath called juſt, becauſe he beleeved God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he muſt ſubmit to his wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> and by the voyce of God is commanded, <hi>All things whatſoever Sarah ſaith, heare her voyce.</hi> So <hi>Rebecca</hi> firmly beleeving, proceedeth to aske of God, and for an anſwer, ſhe heareth a miracle, <hi>Two Nations are in thy wombe, and two people ſhall be divided from thy belly.</hi> And the widdow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> beleeved <hi>Eliah,</hi> although he did tel her a difficult thing.

Adde moreover, thoſe which have teſtified the conſtancy of their faith by patience in Martyrdome, by contempt of death, whoſe number is no leſſe then mens.</p>
            <p>Neither is to be paſt by with ſilence, that wonderfull mother, and <note place="margin">2 Mac. 7.</note>worthy of the memory of all good men, who ſeeing her ſeven ſons periſhing by cruel martyrdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was not only of good courage, but alſo ſtrongly did exhort to put them to death: &amp; ſhe her ſelf, truſting in the Lord in al conditions, after her ſons, was alſo put to death, for the Laws and Liberties of her Country.

            <p>Finally, This moſt Religious Sex alone, or at leaſt cheifly is it, in which the Catholique faith, and the continued works of godlineſſe ſhine bright continually to this day; but leaſt any ſhould doubt that women are not able to doe all thoſe things appertaining to men; let us run over the matter by examples, and wee ſhall finde, there is no famous action in any kind of Vertues performed by men, which may not as excellently be done by women: <hi>Meliſſae Cybeles</hi> in times paſt were famous for the Prieſthood; from whoſe name other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes Prieſts afterward were called <hi>Meliſſae: Hypecauſtria</hi> was the Prieſt of <hi>Minerva, Mera</hi> of <hi>Venus, Iphigenia</hi> of <hi>Diana</hi> and

In our Religion, although the office of Prieſt-hood be forbidden women, we know notwithſtanding, that Hiſtories declare, that women ſometimes concealing their Sex have aſcended to the top of the High Prieſts office. So many there have beene moſt holy Abbeſſes and Nuns, whom antiquity was not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to call Prieſts.

But wherefore do I ſpeake concerning this? becauſe women (by nature it ſelfe alone) without doubt ſeem to excell Artificers in all Diſciplines: do not Grammarians boaſt themſelves to be Maſters of Well-ſpeaking? and do we not learn that better from Nurſes, and Mothers, then from Grammarians? hath not Mother <hi>Cornelia</hi> fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the moſt eloquent tongue of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> and the mother of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrinus,</hi> taught <hi>Sylem</hi> the ſon of <hi>Aripithus</hi> the King of <hi>Scythia</hi> the Greek tongue? did not alwayes children (born in <hi>Colonies</hi> brought in with ſtrange Nations) hold the ſpeech of their mothers?

            <p>And are not alſo Poets in their Trifles and Fables, and Logicians in their Notionall contentions overcome by women? There is not an Orator ſo good, or ſo happy, but the perſwaſion of a light Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife will overcome him.</p>
            <p>What Arithmetician by caſting up falſely can deceive a woman of her due benevolence? What Muſician can equall a woman by ſinging and pleaſantneſſe of voice? Philoſophers, Mathematicians, Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, are they not in their Divinations, and Prognoſtications often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inferiour to plaine Country women? and often an old woman excells a Phyſitian. <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelfe the wiſeſt of all men (if cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit may be given to the teſtimony of <hi>Pythius)</hi> and mature in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet diſdained not to learn ſomething of the Lady <hi>Aſpaſia:</hi> So neither was <hi>Apollos</hi> the divine, aſhamed to be inſtructed by <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla.</hi>

            <p>Who can be ſufficient to enumerate the infinite praiſes of women, on whom all our being, and the whole conſervation of man-kinde (which otherwiſe in ſhort time would periſh) and every Family and Common-wealth dependeth?

            <p>At length the Capitoll being taken by the <hi>Sabins,</hi> when they had fought moſt bloodily together in the middeſt of the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117398:17"/>
at the running in of women between the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the War ceaſed, and at length a Peace, and League was made, and they entered into a perpetuall Friendſhip; wherefore <hi>Romulus</hi> put the names of them upon the family of the <hi>Curii,</hi> and by conſent of the <hi>Romans,</hi> it was ſet down in publick Records, that women ſhould neither grind, nor play the Cook: That women ſhould be forbid to receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing from the Husband by gift, and the Husband to receive any thing, by gift from the Wife, that they might know, that all good things were common. Hence aroſe the cuſtom, that in their marriages, the wife ſhould be brought in ſaying <hi>ubi tu, ego;</hi> denoting, wher thou art Maſter, I am Miſtris; where thou art Lord, I am Lady. Afterwards when the Bands of the <hi>Volſcians</hi> pitched their Camp within five miles of the City, when, their Kings being expelled, <hi>(Coriolanus Martius</hi> was Captain) they were turned back by women: In honour of which exploit, a famous Temple was dedicated to Womens Fortune: Yea, notable enſignes of great honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were given to them by Decree of the Senate. So it comes about, that they take the upper-hand in the way, and men riſe up and give them place.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Purple garments with gold Lace, Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gems, Earings, Golden-Chains are allowed them, for it was provided by the Lawes of following Emperours, as often times as there were Statutes made which prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted certaine Garments and Ornaments, that womens Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould not be comprehended under them; they were alſo rewarded with ſucceſſions of inheritances and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: and it was permitted by the Lawes, to celebrate with publick praiſes the Funeralls of Women, as the Funeralls of famous Men: in regard, that when the preſent was to be ſent to <hi>Delphian Apollo,</hi> by the deſire of <hi>Camillus,</hi> and ſo much gold could not be had, the women brought the Ornaments of their bodies of their own accord towards it.</p>

brought againe into a good poſture of defence, and gave to their enemies a notable overthrow; for which deed it was determined by the Lawes of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as they enter the City, ſhould give to each woman ſome ſummes of gold; which <hi>Macedo</hi> twice entering the City, twice payed. Moreover hee commanded the gift ſhould be doubled to women with childe; So women were preſented with every kind of honour by the ancient Kings of the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> from the cradles (as I may ſay) of the Roman City and Empire, yea, and not leſſe honoured by the Emperours themſelves. Hence, <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus</hi> the Emperor did think fit, that the advice and counſel of his Wife ſhould be taken in making Laws. And elſewhere the Law ſaith, becauſe the Wife ſhineth in the honour of the Husband, that he might take notice of her ſplendor, as in how much the Husband is exalted, ſo much is the Wife: So the Wife of an Emperour, is called an Empereſſe; and the Wife of a King, a Queen; and the Wife of a Prince, a Princeſſe, and illuſtrious howſoever ſhe was borne: And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpianus</hi> ſaith, a Prince or Emperour is freed from and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Lawes; but <hi>Auguſta,</hi> which is the Wife of an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, although ſhe be not free from the Lawes by her ſelfe, notwithſtanding the Prince, or Emperour brings the ſame Priviledges to her, as he hath himſelfe. Hence it is that famous women are permitted to judge, and to arbitrate, and that they might be capable to inveſte into Fee-Farme Land, and of being inveſted, and to determine what right vaſſalls have: And it appertaineth to the ſame thing, that women may have particular Servants, as the man hath, and the woman is able to judge amongſt ſtrangers; ſhe is alſo of power to put a name upon a family, ſo that Sons might be denominated from their Mother, not from their Father; they have alſo great Priviledges concerning Dowries, here and there expreſt in divers parts of the body of the Lawes, where alſo proviſion was made, that women of honeſt life, and fame, ought not to be impriſoned for civill debtes yea, that Judge was puniſhed with death, which ſhould put her

in priſon. But if ſhe were ſuſpected of a fault, ſhe was thruſt into a Monaſtery, or was delivered to the cuſtody of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be ſecured, becauſe by the teſtimony of the Law the woman is in better condition then the man: as alſo in the ſame kind of offence, the man offendeth more then the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Hence the man taken in Adultery is puniſhed with death, but the woman Adultereſſe ſhe is but commanded into a Monaſtery.</p>
            <p>Many priviledges <hi>Azo</hi> gathereth in his ſummary upon the titles of the <hi>Velleian</hi> Councell, and <hi>Speculator</hi> upon the <hi>Renunciations;</hi> yea, thoſe ancient Law-givers, grave men, by their wiſdome, as I may ſay, Artificers of Commonwealths, in knowledge moſt eminent, <hi>Licurgus,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> (I ſay) when as they knew out of the Secrets of Philoſophy, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men neither by excellency of mind, nor by ſtrength of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor dignity of nature, were inferior to men, but equall to them in all things; they appointed women to be exerciſed with men in Wraſtlings, and Tournaments; alſo in all things that appertain to Warlike Diſcipline, in the Bow, in the Sling, in the caſting of Darts, in ſhooting, in ſcirmiſhing in Armour both by Horſe and Foote, in pitching of Camps, and ordering of Armies, in leading of Hoſts, and (as I may ſpeake briefly) they gave all thoſe things to women, which now are the exerciſes of men.</p>
            <p>Let us read Writers of antiquities worthy of beleife, we ſhall finde in <hi>Getulia, Bactris, Galletia,</hi> that the manner hath been for the men to be given to effeminatneſſe, and luxury, but the women, to Till Ground, Build, Trade, Ride, War, as men with us doe now.</p>
            <p>With the <hi>Cantabrians,</hi> men did give portions to women, Brothers were given in marriage by Siſters, and the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were appointed Heires. With the <hi>Scythians, Thracians</hi> and <hi>Gaules</hi> Offices were common both to women and to men: And in Councels, either for War or Peace, women were adhered to in judgement as ſoon, or before men; which the league of the <hi>Celtans</hi> with <hi>Haniball</hi> doth demonſtrate in theſe words, <hi>If any one of the</hi> Celtans <hi>complaineth that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by any of the</hi> Carthaginians, <hi>let the Magiſtrate or the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:117398:19"/>
               <hi>of the</hi> Carthaginians, <hi>which are in</hi> Spaine, <hi>be Judges of the matter: If any one of the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>hath ſuffered any unjuſt thing from any of the</hi> Celtans, <hi>let the women of the</hi> Celtans <hi>be judges concerning that matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, that liberty and priviledge which was given to Women, is reſtrained by the Lawes of men (whoſe tyranny uſurpes againſt God and Natures Lawes) aboliſhed by uſe and cuſtome, and extinguiſhed by the manner of their education; for a woman by and by as ſoon as ſhe is borne, and from the firſt beginning of her years is detained in ſloth at home, and as uncapable of another Province, ſhe is permitted to think of nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides her Needle or the like; when afterwards ſhe reacheth to ripeneſſe of age, ſhe is delivered up to the jealous rule of her husband, or elſe ſhut up in the perpetual Bridewell of Nuns; alſo publicke Offices are forbidden them by Lawes, it is not permitted that any one plead in judgement, be ſhe never ſo wiſe.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, They are not to meddle in juriſdictions, arbitrements, adoptions, interceſſions, procurations, Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianſhips, in cauſes Teſtamentary or criminall. Alſo it is not lawfull for them to preach the word of God: which is againſt expreſſe Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which the holy ſpirit promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to women by the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> ſaying, <hi>And your daughters ſhall propheſie;</hi> even as in the time of the Apoſtles, they did publickly teach, as it is noted by <hi>Anna</hi> the wife of <hi>Simeon,</hi> and the daughters of <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> the wife of <hi>Aquila:</hi> So great is the wickedneſſe of all late Law-makers, that they have made voide the commandments of God by their owne traditions; becauſe, Women, otherwiſe by the prerogative of Nature, and excellency in dignity moſt noble, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce more vile by condition, and inferiour to all men.</p>
            <p>By their Lawes, women are compelled to give place to men, as the conquered to the conquerors in Warre, not either by naturall or divine Command or Reaſon; But by Cuſtome, Education, Fortune, and by a certaine ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall humour of men inforcing.</p>
            <p>There are moreover which aſſume Authority to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117398:19"/>
over Women by vertue of Religion, and doe prove their Tyranny out of holy Writ; who have that curſe of <hi>Eve</hi> continually in their mouths; <hi>under the power</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>
               <hi>of man thou ſhalt be, and hee ſhall rule over thee:</hi> That if it be Anſwered them, that Chriſt hath taken away the Curſe, they will object the ſame thing from the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. Col. 3. Epheſ. 5.</note>of which thing <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſpeakes, <hi>Let Women bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Husbands, let Womem be ſilent in the Church,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thoſe who know the various Tropes and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of Scripture, will eaſily perceive thoſe places differ not really, and internally, but onely in barke and out-ſide; for there is that Order in the Church, that Men are preferred before Women in the Miniſtry; but onely as the Jewes before the Greekes in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <note place="margin">Rom. 2. Acts 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe; God is no reſpecter of perſons; for in Chriſt neither Male nor Female, but a new creature is accepted.</p>
            <p>But alſo for the moſt part things are permitted to Men, by reaſon of their hardneſſe of heart againſt Women; as in time paſt Bills of Divorcement were granted to the Jewes, which notwithſtanding abridge not the dignity of Women; for Men being deficient and weake, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had the power of Judgement, to the reproach of Men.</p>
            <p>And the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſhall one day judge the men of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Who therefore are juſtified by faith, are made Sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but Sonnes (I ſay) of the Promiſe, are ſubjected to Women, and are obnoxious to that Command of God, ſpeaking to <hi>Abraham,</hi>

               <hi>All things that</hi> Sarah <hi>ſaith unto thee; heare her voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, that I may now recollect my ſelfe, very briefly I have ſhewed the excellency of the Female Sexe by many Arguments, <hi>(viz.)</hi> by Name, by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by Place, by Matter: And what dignity the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath acquired (above <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e Man) from God. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we have demonſtrated by Religion, Reaſon, Nature, Humane Lawes, by various Authority, Reaſons

and Examples. Notwithſtanding, we have not ſaid ſo many things, but wee have left as many yet to be ſpoken, becauſe not moved by ambition, or for Vaine-Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſake I came to write, but by Duty, and Truth, that I may not ſeeme as an envious, and detracting man to ſnatch away from ſo Noble a Sexe, their due and juſt prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by a certaine wicked ſilence, if I were ſilent.</p>
            <p>If any more curious ſhall finde ſome Argument paſſed by, which hee may thinke ought to bee added to this Worke, I ſhall think my ſelfe not reprooved of him, but helped, ſo far as he may render this our good worke better by his wit and learning.
