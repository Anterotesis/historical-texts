            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But besides, as the snares, hazards, and anxieties of great men are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, so their Eclipses are fatal, and their falls desperate; They are always surprised with ruine, and their defeat is like that of Legions, when they are cut in pieces before they can rally or make head.

               <hi>Machiavel</hi> could invent but two sorts of remedies for so imminent a mischief; The first and more excellent, hee faith, is to yield to the torrent, by assuming no honours, arrogating no triumphs, entertaining small retinue; Finally, by taking all occasions to sleight their own atchievements, that so all glory may flow to the Prince, as to its Oceans, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the interruption of Mils or Dams; But since Vertue being the disease, Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty seldom proves the cure: His next and safer counsel is, not to trust too much to innocency, merit, or present appearances, but to be as jealous as their masters, like Ravens, to smell Gun-pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at a distance, to lie perdieu for their own safety; And upon the first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, to be before-hand with danger, to make use of the utmost advantages they are trusted with, to assure themselves of timely retreats and confederacies, that preventing fraud with fraud, and repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling force with force, they may be in a condition not only to stand upon thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Truly, if we look upon the Counsel of this great Politick with the eyes of nature, above all things concerned in its own welfare, it seems to be a friendly whisper, an admonition full of prudence, and favourable to vertue; it teaches men to determine resolutely of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, to cut off parboyled fear, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen delays, to hope even in despair, and to prevent preventions. Thus we read of <hi>Getulicus,</hi> that warned through the numerous examples of his masters rigor, by a kind of prudent disloialty, he secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself, and of all <hi>Seianus</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, alone survived so bloudy a scene.

            <p>The Scriptures are so elegant in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing the infamy of the wicked, as if they meant to aggravate it beyond any earthly misery, so establishing it, as a kind of unfeigned Purgatory between this world and hell, by these and the like Characters, the memory of sinners shall rot; And again, in the next gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, let his name be extinct; from the latter of which places it is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they then immediatly proceed to blot that name out of the Book of life which they have first raced out of the Register of Fame.</p>
            <p>And yet methinks, though Fame may bee desired as a concomitant of more important blessings, surely of it self, as Fame, it seems neither odious nor ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but the most indifferent of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things: When I read the last scene and final <hi>exit</hi> of <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosme,</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who being mortally wounded at the assault of <hi>Rouen,</hi> by him, with infinite fury and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, then taken &amp; sacked, refused the ease and decency of a horse-litter to view his

And therefore here in we should imitate his Wisdome, (<hi>Tacitus Annal. l.</hi> 3.) that determined to passe by all such actions as were not notable either for Honesty or Infamy, as knowing, the end of writing Histories to be, That our Vertues may survive our Persons; and that wicked m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AMongst the many miscarriages of our times, there seems not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of greater importance, then the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours committed in the Education of Youth; which yet, having taken root by Custom, are hard to be removed. If we understood the value of good Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what Vices it prevents, what Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners it plants, Parents would not be so indifferent in the discharge of a duty, which imports their Children more, then all the fortunes they can leave them.</p>
            <p>There is no nature so fierce, no not that of wild Beasts, but it may be tamed, if endeavoured in Youth; no inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so violent, but it may be checked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it take head, and be fortified with habit, all vices being yet as curable, as flesh wounds, whilst they are green; but as we grow old, our faults learn to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe;

then if the Parent reproves, he is answered with snarling and resistance, if the friend go to perrwade, he makes himself an enemy. The Ghostly Father hath a fine time to wear out his lungs with invectives. Alas, good precepts work upon well-disposed minds; but a vicious person is a prejudicate Auditor, and hath so sick a palate, that he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish nothing that is good or wholsom: One early and seasonable reproof shall prevent, what a hundred Sermons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reform, When men have contracted so much rust, that they are past all reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but the Law, And, indeed, are fitter to be made examples, then hear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
            <p>But not to shoot at random, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, I observe in our vulgar breeding, are these.</p>
            <p>First, I conceive, in outward accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments, we study too early and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to advance our Youth, and, by such out-sides, they commonly are valued; but, as for just and sober principles, the love of Vertue, and restraints of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, these goodly and fruitful plants we

               </gap>st men can hardly reform. And withall I am not ignorant, that much hath been written upon this subject, and by m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n whose wits and abilities, I dare not so much as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50918:33"/>
emulate; yet in a matter of so great and publick importance, I hope, I shall not be too severely blamed, if I adventure likewise in a short Essay, to offer some expedients of redress, to those many mischiefs, which proceed from errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Education.</p>
            <p>First then, as the Husband-man with much observation proves the nature of the soyle, before he resolve what grain he will commit unto it, And as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitector d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>alous, or covetous Catholicks, who, before their innocent Daughters know what belongs to a vow, bury them, as it were, alive, in Monasteries. Experience daily teaches us, that such as are not apt for liberal Arts, yet many times prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

employments, nor excess of melancholy for action; He may prove an excellent Mathematician, that would never be good Lawyer, for that depends upon the strength of Imagination, this of Reason. Great Logicians are oft times but ill O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators; For the one requires a strong, the other a fine and Courtly wit; some have solid judgememt, some vast memory, some excel in elocution, some in dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Pen, some have quickness of dispatch, some invincible industry. Every Creature is said to have its peculiar vertue, in some kind or other; but the vast bulk of learning, and general abilities, are not to be grasped at, save by such wits, as are almost as rare as the <hi>Phoenix</hi> or <hi>Vnicorn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, therefore, let every Genius be directed solely or chiefly to those stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and imployments, to which nature first designed them; for that eye which is intent and fixed, sees clearly, whereas variety of objects dazzles; That water, running in one great Chanel, makes a navigable River, which being divided into little streams, they all prove no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50918:34"/>
then ditches. I conceive, if this Rule were practised, Youth would not be so routed and defeated in what they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, as now they are, whilst they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt those Arts and Sciences, which are both for quantity too vast, and for quality, improper for them, like Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, commanded forthy to win passes, and take sconces. Whatsoever the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack digests not, proves but crudity; and variety of imperfect notions, serves only to puffe men up with arrogance, and ostentation, and produces at best but learned ignorance, or confident errours. Whereas by this means, every one would thrive in his way, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Learning, which consists in perfect societies of all Arts, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly flourish. The Jesuites, chiefly by pursuing this wise and accurate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, have advanced literature, enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their own same, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>xalted their Colledges, to the envy of all Universities.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let not superficial Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be so much regarded, as solid foundations, and let not the substance be placed in those things, which were
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50918:35"/>
meant only for glosses and shadows. For though all acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plishments may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and desired, yet not all equally, nor alike in all.

Their censure herein may perhaps be too rigid, yet we should remember the debt we owe to publick, and to posterity, and not resemble our <hi>Virginia</hi> Planters, whose poverty forces
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50918:35"/>
them to plant nothing but Tobacco and other Commodities of present vent; we should use a more excellent Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, like those that bend their designes to set up manufactures, to settle Trade, to establish policy, and turn a Colony in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> above learning it self; for a Common-wealth hath much more need of honest, then wise Citizens, and one good man is worth a Myriade of great wits.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We should endeavour to season Youth with Ingenuity, and stir up the seeds of emulation, that they may no longer act like prest Souldiers, but Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers. That duty may be their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and knowledge the subject of their pride; incentives far more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than terrour or restraint; for what can probably be expected from those that go to school, as if they went to Bridewell, and at best, love book<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

better then a Turn-spit doth his Wheel?</p>
            <p>Fiftly, There should be a <hi>North-west</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage found, for the attaining of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Tongue, that we need not use such a tedious ambages, as is, in effect, more barbarous, then the tying of the Horses tail to the Plough; nor instead of a journey, which might be dispatched in few dayes, wander, like the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> forty years in the Wilderness. For in learning Language, which yet is but the gate or avenue of art &amp; knowledg, we not only lavish our time, but waste that stock of industry, which nature indued us with, for higher and nobler designes; so as being harrassed with this drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we have little vigour left us to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt Philosophy or humane Learning. And let no man object, that our early years are not capable of such improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For why should we doubt, but that Mathematicks, History, and even mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, in some degree, may be insinuated to us very young, since Children are so soon put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>y, and which, indeed, as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50918:36"/>
yet is but too slender and barren? Half that time and diligence which they trifle away in Epistles and Themes, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, miserably patched up of childish matter, and stollen phrases) would yield another manner of fruit, if it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in translating to and fro, the best moral Authours, whereby not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Language would soon grow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, but the stile would imprint it self, and perhaps, the spirit and Idea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with them. Neither do I see, why they should converse so much with the poets at that Age, when they read them, with so much difficulty, and so little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, unless there be a design, in perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scholar, to amuse his Parents. and lengthen the employment. As for <hi>Greek,</hi> though it seemes to be in some proportion necessary to the perfection of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, yet I am sure, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that learn it, it is of little use, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being taught as it is, by halves, as if it were learned on purpose to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. Certainly, were the Rules of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue discreetly abridged, and no other Language spoken in publick

            <p>Sixthly, The learned and able Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Arts and Sciences, should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to render them more clear and Mathematical, by vindicating them from many of those uncertainties and intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies wherewith they are now entangled, that our knowledge be no longer buil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed the want of seasonable and convenient ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements, for great wits and spirits, drives them oft times to seek it by indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect means, and possibly hath been the hidden spark, that hath in all ages, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led notable flames in the world.</p>

            <p>These are the principal cautions, which readily offer themselves unto me, and which I recommend to all young Travellers: from these they may expect much security and benefit; Yet, since we first learn to swim with Corks and

            <p>Necessary is sobriety of life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to give his Pupil none, but good example, which will add vigour to all his Counsels and reproofs; Prudence, to sit like a wary Pylot at the Helm, and foresee inconveniences, before they fall; Urbanity and gentleness of speech and behaviour, to be the ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Money is to Travellers, as Wings to Birds, they have no other friend, or passe-port, nothing else that can recommend or address them to society; for they must buy their acquiantance, almost, as they do that which they eat or wear, and by discreet prodigality, woe acceptance, since they are not welcom upon ordinary terms, And whosoever lodges a stranger, makes account he hath a booty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, though the wary and prudent fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate their expectation, yet they cannot

            <p>There is a confidence, grounded upon the precipitated admission of those things for certain truths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the soundness whereof we are afraid to examine: Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are they, that seasonably discover the rottenness of such foundations, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves to lay sure ones.

So that this fear, (though sometimes it may seem to fight with its own shadow) is a safe and fruitful fear, recompensing the Anxieties of a moment, with eternal security.</p>

               </gap>ves, condemned, as it were, to the Galleys of Fear. An Argument, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly full of sweetness, If it did not tend wholly to undermine duty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Power of Religion into Airy Speculation; If it did not teach men to be so unmannerly at their Devotions, that their Prayers prove commonly but contempts: should the Heathen, (who profoundly adore the workmanship of their own hands,) see their Irreverence, They would with some colour be apt to confirm themselves in their Idolatrous surmise, That it is better to have visible, than invisible Deities.</p>
            <p>Fear is as a bridle to the Conscience; That soul which hath no fear, is like a Ship, that carries all it sayles, but hath no ballasts, If it could escape over-setting in the Sea, yet it is sure to split upon the Rocks: We do not more need the zeal
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50918:45"/>
of generous Love, then the caution of well advised Fear.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge those Acts of Piety to be the most excellent, that proceed pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Ingenuity of love; But these are certainly the least for number, The greatest are such, as derive themselves from a principle, mixt of necessity and choice. Love indeed makes the purest Holocausts, yet are not the Sacrifices of innocent fear to be undervalued; I am perswaded, Fear hath resisted, as many, and as strong temptations, as Love.</p>
            <p>But who is so Chymical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he can extract, who so Metaphysical, that he can abstract love from fear? Fear is as the Lees of Love, which it can never work out in this life, nor will it ever be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of those Crudities, till it ferment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perfect Charity. Love is no bondage indeed, but a non-age it is, and a filiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which for the present, differs little from the condition of a Servant.</p>
            <p>A lively Emblem of this truth, we shall find in friendship; What a Critick is it of words? What a searcher into thoughts? what a spie upon our actions,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50918:45"/>
and manners? How doth every omission beget a kind of guilt? How are true friends more sensible and fearful of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness then wounds, of giving then receiving? And this is the Estate of all Vertuous or real Amity; A relation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, which <hi>primâ facie,</hi> seems to consist wholly in Confidence.</p>
            <p>A yet neerer, and more sublime Idea of our Love to God, is natural Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, That, by whose light and aid, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers atchieved such Miracles of Vertue and self-conquest. What a Curb was this in the mouths of good Heathens? What a restraint, far beyond any sense of Honour, or fear of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? How did it suppress the passions, and smother the thoughts, that they durst not so much as dream extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? And yet what society to good men, so sweet as solitude? He that is not clear in his own sight, where should he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish his Confidence, where shall he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a firm league? Howbeit this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that true Philosophy enjoynes every man, to be his own <hi>AEacus &amp; Minos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that it may yet further appear,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50918:46"/>
how love and fear are mixed and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven, Every dayes experience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims it; For whence comes the Misers love of his money, but from fear of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty? wherein consists the Enjoyment of health, but in security from sickness? And how could miserable life be so precious, even to unfortunate men, If they did not rather fear the approach of death, then love or relish those dregs of their lives?</p>
            <p>Now therefore, since God is greater than our Consciences, more intimate than any friend, more precious than life, What an awe must we have of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, what a horrour of his absence? What prostration to him can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted superstition? what Zeal, Will-worship? what ambition can we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but that of humility? what emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that of reverence? who can be morigerous enough in his duty, who cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect enough in his behaviour, what repentance is sufficient to pacifie, what prayers to intreat, what addresses to adore him?</p>
            <p>What signifie those precepts of awe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50918:46"/>
an reverence, so frequently repeated, as well in the Gospel, as under the Law? The numerous Catalogues of such, as with speedy vengeance have paid the forfeiture both of Impiety and sawcy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion? Those Characters of his wrath, with so much terrour recorded, unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their watchings and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? their self-revenge and violence done even to nature? What do they all teach us? but this, That God will be served with industrious fear, and not with lazy love?</p>
            <p>But, if any yet seem to doubt, let him reflect upon himself, How he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, not with the rigour of the Law, but the latitude of the Gospel; What he hath deserved at the hands of God, and what will certainly befall him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Ocean of mercy, He shall then find far greater ground of distrust, then of confidence, If not, yet let him not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce

            <p>Religion is like a curious Watch, soon out of frame, And Discipline is as the case that preserves it; Religion is like the Apple of the eye, tender and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to every dust, And Discipline is as the eye-lid that shelters it.</p>
            <p>I see not, why any should hate Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but such as resolve to abuse their liberty; There is no enemy to Lawes, but the lawless, and such as think they have more interest in their punishments, than their protections, or hope, that in a general medley and Chaos of disorder, their evil manners will passe unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, nay uncontroled, For what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint is left for those sins, which stand in awe, neither of justice nor shame?</p>
            <p>Not of Justice, For how wickedly do many live, even to the reproach of that holy faith which they profess, and yet either satisfie, or delude the Law?

Not of shame, For in a general disorder, none is censured, And whilst every one is scandalous, no man is scandalized.</p>
            <p>The sarcedotal, and Apostolical Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces indeed, are ceased, But the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call function still survives, Nor are those ordinary jurisdictions lost, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles held, not as Apostles, but Bishops, whereof none ever seemed to have so much need, as this latter and perillous Age, which is prophetically entituled to such a Catalogue of enormous sins, as the simplicity of primitive times was scarcely acquainted with: We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to expect no miracles, But shall vve submit to no Government? because vve cannot have <hi>Moses,</hi> shall vve admit of no Magistrates?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50918:48"/>Long lay the primitive Christians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the grievous yoak of Heathenish Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, enjoying neither toleration, nor connivence; They had then no Lawes, but of their own admission, No Governours, but of their own permission; They lived rather by Examples then Lawes: It was then but necessary, there should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, to supply the defect of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary powers; Now that Christians are our Magistrates, It may justly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that what was planted by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, should be cherished by Lawes: But no persecuted Church can be in so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable a condition, as that which wants Apostles, and rejects Pastors.</p>

            <p>Truly, as the Civil Sword protects the Church, so again, the Church being armed with convenient Discipline, may add much force and vigour to the Civil Powers, and even protect its own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector; By planting in mens hearts the awe of Religion, which is the main pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>HAving briefly treated of single Life, It remains now to take a survey of Conjugall. The first concerns few, and those esteemed but a kind of Anchorites, and looked upon as the Schismaticks of humane Society; The second is of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral extent, And whatsoever is said upon that subject, seems to touch Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: Give me leave therefore to offer somewhat by way of Essay only (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Argument or reproof) in relation to Duties, so vast and publick as those of Matrimony; And let not any marvail, That being neither in Act, nor Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, as yet a Husband, I am so busie to thrust my self into the Charge, and instruct the maried; For I conceive, That as a third Party, uninteressed, I were the fitter, if need required, to interpose; However, since I undertake to state no

Controversies, but deliver Truths, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received, and favourable alike to both sides, My forwardnesse in this kind, if it deserve no commendation, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure no just offence.</p>

            <p>This is the disguise, that renders those Actions plausible, which if naked and uncouched, would not be patdonable, This is the dresse, which favours defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and the boot which hides the crookedness of the Leg; For whilst Hypocrisie p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This is that Mock-Authority, which gives a counterfeit passe-port to all our Vices, And affords a safety to guilt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the security of the innocent; which by its false marches, and continual tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses, leads the Lawes a Dance, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven harasses the Magistrate, with the frequency of its Alarms, The only good it hath, is this, That it proclaims the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a Resurrection, when simplicity shall triumph over Craft.</p>
            <p>Truly, Nothing doth so fatally evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the declining of our Manners, as to see Craft in such Reputation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exalted with all the Panegyricks due to wisdom; As if we were to be train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Vertue, like the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Children to the Warres, In whom the dexterity of Stealing, and impudence of Lying were held presages of heroick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; Craft, which dares not look o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor its own Conscience, in the

            <p>Yet, let it passe, It may shift for a while, But for the most part, it owes an account, even in this life; Oft times its imbecillity betrayes it, But seldom it outlives the countermine of a greater subtilty than its own; In the mean time, let it enjoy its self-hatred, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light (if it can) in those perplexities &amp;

reasonably date the time of our being, as <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth was wont to reckon his Age, onely from the day of his Retreat. It is a seasonable interval of perfect lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, wherein the soul, being no longer biassed &amp; diverted with present amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, seriously reflects upon things Past, and diligently prepares her self for things to come; Till then, she was wholly laid aside, the Body kept her, as it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hatches, and she lived, but like slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Coals raked up in vast Embers. Now, being delivered from her bondage, she appears in Equipage, like worthy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, recalled from banishment, to be invested with Supreme Authority.

            <p>VVHen I consider, how true Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing improves every faculty of the Soul, how it refines the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reforms the Mind; In fine, how it makes almost as vast a difference betwixt men and men, as betwixt Men and Animals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet withall Observe, what slender homage is performed to the Gown, And what silly advantages most men reap from their Studies; mine ears cannot but tingle at that unhappy, yet true Proverb: Physicians get the wealth, and Lawyers the Honor, whilst Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy walkes in <hi>Quirpo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely, It was otherwise of Old; When seven Cities bandied for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Homers</hi> nativity, When the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Socrates</hi> was attested by Oracle, When Philosophers were Princes Peers, at least their Co-adjutors and Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50918:70"/>
substituted, like great Clerks, to supply the non-residence of Cardinals; When the Consulship of <hi>Rome</hi> was the daily Guerdon of Eloquence.</p>
            <p>But, indeed, the Cause of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is too apparent, such only were then accounted Learned, as lived more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly then they spake or dictated; And those were thought illiterate, though never so prompt and subtle, whose halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Practices betrayed the lameness of their Minds; Sophistry was not yet in Credit, nor any of those Superficial Arts, which prove abortive of Wisdom, and fruitful onely of Ostentation; There were not many that had Confidence to usurp a title so envious as Philosophy, such as then wore the Venerable Gown, having purchased fame by degrees and Methods, and so attaind to Maturity, needed no other Characters of Honor, then those that were written in their foreheads.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Learned of our Age are so far from challenging reverence or true applause, that they even fall into contempt, and are become the onely
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50918:70"/>
persons in Comoedies; They may well pretend to Learning, but their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our proclaims them strangers to liberal Science; Though their tougues speak Greek, yet their manners savour of the Barbarian.</p>

            <p>IT seems to be an Argument, alone suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to perswade thrift, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, no man is rich or happy; For Luxury, as it tends to ruine at last, so, in the mean time, it exposes to all the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

            <p>But let us withall consider, That the Riotous are no better than Vermine,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50918:77"/>
born to consume and devour, Drones, which making no Hony themselves, eat up that which the industry of the Bees hath gathered; For though some will object, that vast expence serves to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en commerce, and with some equality distribute wealth; Yet it were too bold a Paradox to maintain, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth hath need of Vice to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it.</p>
            <p>Let us remember, that for a man to sacrifice his Estate to his present Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, savours of the meer Epicure, and is a more then brutish improvidence, That it hath lesse excuse, then the prophaness of <hi>Esau,</hi> which would plead extremity of hunger; Indeed, how can he be thought to contemplate eternity, that neglects posterity, and looks not beyond an instant of time?</p>
            <p>Certainly, There is much Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, nay Divinity in true thrift; It is the equiballance of the soul betwixt Lust and Avarice; For thrift is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with, but neer of kin to Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, preserving it both from vice and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; since it is seldom seen, That

            <p>The vertue of Frugality dwells not in the hand, but in the mind; Else we must ascribe much Vertue to our Iron Chests; <hi>Parsimony</hi> therefore is a foul imposture; For though it want not its pretence, The exorbitancies and mischiefs of Luxury

            </p>
            <p>Indeed the Valour of our times seems to be the most irregular of all the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, subject to much Intemperance, and Transportation, Very apt to degenerate into Rashness and Insolency. Patience
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50918:78"/>
is a Quality composed of Religion and Reason, Free from the Neighbourhood of Vice.</p>
            <p>Valour resembles the leaves and blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms of the Tree, most agreeable, indeed to the fight, but flourishing only in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; Patience is like the root or sap, which though secret, and concealed to the eye, yet keeps it alive in Winter, and preserves it from the injuries of Winds and Blasts.</p>
            <p>Valour is so much seated in the Liver and Veins, Tha sometimes it appears to have more of Complexion then Vertue. Patience dwells in the upper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>egion of the soul, and hath no Commerce with the blood or humours of the body.</p>
            <p>Valour is exposed to many surprisals, and is observed to have its gayeties and intermissions, It is not alwayes at hand, nor alwayes useful, For it rusts in peace. But Patience is an Armory, alwayes ready, alwayes necessary, We have not greater use of the Elements, than of it.</p>
            <p>Alas! Who can fight against his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny? Or what will it avail men to dare,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50918:79"/>
when they are called to Suffer? When we come to grapple with death, or close with afflictions, more grievous than it, A dram of Patience is then worth an ounce of Valour: Valour like a stone Wall is broken with obstinate resistance, whilst Patience, like a Rampart of Mud, damps the violence by yielding.</p>
            <p>Valour is a Vertue, that hath cost the World dear, Mankind is thought to have payd for it, more than it is worth; It carries, like <hi>Sylla,</hi> wrath and ruine in its countenance, And no Comet hath had so fatal an influence, upon humane affaires, Witness the subversions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and Corruptions of manners, which it daily and every where effects, introducing for Justice &amp; Modesty, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot and Rapin, for the Arts and Learning of <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Ignorance and Barbarism of <hi>Gothes</hi>; These are the fruits of this tyranical Vertue, which knowes no end of booty and Conquest. Patience was never injurious to any, but as it is happy to it self, so it is alwayes innocent to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ambitious of nothing but Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:50918:79"/>Yet, in regard we are fallen into those latter times, when he that wants a sword, is advised to sell his Cloak, and buy one: Swords, I confess, are now become as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary as Lawes, And we can no more want Valour, than Justice, For how shall that protect others, which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend it self; Justly therefore doth the World do homage to a Vertue, which is at once both terrible, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, since from it we fear our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and to it we owe our Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; It oppresses indeed, and that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heavily, But withall, it rescues us from all Oppressions; save its own: Truly it hath an excellent use; But then like strong Minerals, it must be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and refined from its Crudities; It must be steered by a better Pilot, For like fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now this Vertue in men, is parallel to one of the greatest Excellencies of the Divine nature, For as God, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves our wants, exercises his Mercy, so doth he, when he forgives o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Policy, in this sense, is as a corrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Maxime he layes as the basis of all his Justice, That it were better many great offendors should escape, than one hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

since it is superiour even to Justice, A vertue truly soveraign, and incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable.</p>

            <p>He is not easily scared out of honest Principles, nor are his sober and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous resolutions checked with any servile feare; For he hates that Providence, which, to the Prejudice of vertue, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees all possibility of hazard, and reserves his friendship then to appear, when all others are timorous, and withdraw themselves.</p>
            <p>He despises not Honour, in regard it is or ought to be the shadow of Vertue, yet weighs not himself by titles, since they adde not to his intrinsicall Value; He is rather content with the true honour of doing nothing unworthy of himself, and with the Greatnesse of a sincere heart, Thus he never seeks preferment, but it allwayes follows him, and he hath the refusall of it.</p>
            <p>He is cautious, in Promising, for he is rigorous in performing, and can give no greater assurance then his word, from which to recede, might perhaps do injury to others, but to himself vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>

            <p>Prosperity he suspects, as temperate men do sweet Wine, And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes it with sober recollection and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy, Adversity is more his Element, He is the same to the World in both E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, Onely to himself severer in the former, doing double duty, in regard his greatest enemies are then neerest.</p>
            <p>He is large in all his actions, noble in his entertainments, laying the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of magnificence, in discreet frugality, Careless of outward things, as his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will permit, And if he be rich, he is not in bondage, nor pupillage to his Estate.</p>

he esteemes a holy Mystery, and would as soon commit sacriledge it self, as wrong it. Of nothing, but God, and his own Conscience, he stands in awe, And therefore is as solicitous, in directing his thoughts, as wary, in framing his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, And provides, that his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be as well upright, and reasonable, as his actions morall.</p>

            <p>He will know, that his speech can hardly be sufficiently weighed, so as it neither ssavour of levity, nor give offence, especially in such an Age as this, wherein there may perhaps be as little safety in telling truths, as honesty in speaking falshoods, And prejudices are so many, That the veriest Sycophant findes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do to please all.</p>
            <p>He will consider, That the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Discourses, may be either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly

However, he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peremptory, nor loud in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; Not peremptory, For bold assertions proclaim either invincible ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or overweening prejudice, which is ever blind of one eye; Nor loud, because he directs his speech, not to Sense, but Reason.</p>
            <p>

            <p>He will be serious, even in his mirth, and wonderful choice in the subject of his Jests, so that they render him, neither faulty to himself, nor guilty to others, For unseasonable scoffes are sometimes as much resented, as solemn injuries, And friendship hath as oft been broken in jest, as in earnest.</p>

            <p>AMongst the Characters of heroicall Vertues, I may not omit one so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, as that of thankfulness, since, he that exhorts others to be thankful, pleads the Cause both of God and Man.</p>
            <p>A grear Vertue, said I, nay rather a great Duty, and but a little Vertue; since eminent Vertues are such only, as seem to supererogate, Or at least enlarge themselves, beyond the narrow Chanel of not offending.</p>
            <p>Yet, I cannot concur in Opinion, with those that would have Gratitude to be a limb of Commutative Justice, no more then I esteem Bounty, a species of Commerce. But this I dare not affirm, that the unthankful are but Galley-slaves to the Law, and cannot pretend to so much, as natural Conscience; for it is
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50918:90"/>
observable, That even Beasts of Prey, that have no bowels of mercy, nor sense of Justice, have yet a kind of Religion to remember benefits, Nothing is unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but evil Angels, and wicked men.</p>
            <p>An Ungrateful man is a Felon to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which recommends to him Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, (if possible) before Religion it self, And layes it as the Corner-stone o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
