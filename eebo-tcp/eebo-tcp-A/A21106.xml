            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But sith we liue in such a time, in which nothing can escape the enuious tooth and backiting tongue of an impure mouth, and wherein euery blind corner hath a squint-eyed <hi>Zoilus,</hi> that can looke aright vpon no mans doings, (yea sure there be some that will not sticke to call <hi>Hercules</hi> himselfe a dastard, because forsooth he fought with a club and not at the rapier and dagger:) therefore I thinke no man of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will iudge this my labour needlesse, in seeking to remoue away those slaunders that either the malice of those that loue it not, or the folly of those that vnderstand it not, hath deuised against it: for indeed as the old saying is, <hi>Scientia non habet inimicum praeter ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem:</hi> Knowledge hath no soe but the ignorant.<note place="margin">The diuision of the Apologie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Therefore against these three I must arme me with the best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue weapons I can: and if I happen to giue a blow now and then in mine owne defence, and as good fencers vse to ward and strike at once, I must craue pardon of course, seeing our law allowes that is done <hi>se defendendo:</hi> and the law of nature teacheth <hi>vim vi repellere.</hi> First therefore of Poetrie it selfe,<note place="margin">Of Poetrie.</note> for those few that generally disallow it, might be sufficient to alledge those many that generally approue it, of which I could bring in such an armie, not of souldiers, but of famous Kings and captaines, as not onely the sight, but the very sound of them were able to vanquish and dismay the small forces of our aduersaries. For who would once dare to oppose himselfe against so many <hi>Alexanders, Caesars, Scipios,</hi> (to omit infinite other Princes, both of former and later ages, and of forraine and nearer countries) that with fauour, with studie, with practise, with example, with honors, with gifts, with preferments, with great and magnificent cost, haue encouraged and aduanced Poets and Poetrie? As witnesse the huge Theaters and Amphitheaters, monuments of stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous charge, made onely for Tragedies and Comedies, the workes of Poets to be represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on: but all these aides and defences I leaue as supersluous, my cause I count so good, and the euidence so open, that I neither need to vse the countenance of any great state to bolster it, nor the cunning of any suttle lawyer to enforce it: my meaning is plainely
<pb facs="tcp:7215:3"/>
and <hi>bonafide,</hi> confessing all the abuses that can truly be obiected against some kind of Poets, to shew you what good vse there is of Poetrie. Neither do I suppose it to be greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houefull for this purpose, to trouble you with the curious definitions of a Poet and Poesie, and with the subtill distinctions of their sundrie kinds, nor to dispute how high and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall the name of a Maker is, so christned in English by that vnknowne Godfather, that this last yeare saue one, viz. 1589. set forth a booke, called the Art of English Poetrie: and least of all do I purpose to bestow any long time to argue, whether <hi>Plato, Zenophon</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus,</hi> writing fictions and dialogues in prose, may iustly be called Poes; or whether <hi>Lucan</hi> writing a storie in verse be an Historiographer, or whether Master <hi>Faire</hi> translating <hi>Virgil,</hi> Master <hi>Golding</hi> translating <hi>Ouids</hi> Metamorphosis, and my selfe in this worke that you see, be any more then versifiers, as the same <hi>Ignoto</hi> termeth all translators: for as for all, or the most part of such questions, I will referre you to Sir <hi>Philip Sidneys</hi> Apologie, who doth han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them right learnedly, or to the forenamed treatise, where they are discoursed more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and where, as it were a whole receit of Poetrie is prescribed, with so many new named fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, as would put me in great hope in this age to come would breed many excellent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, saue for one obseruation that I gather out of the very same booke. For though the poore gentleman laboreth greatly to proue, or rather to make Poetrie an art, and reciteth as you may see in the plurall number, some pluralities of patternes, and parcels of his owne Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, with diuers peeces of Partheniads and hymnes in praise of the most praise-worthy: yet whatsoeuer he would proue by all these, sure in my poore opinion he doth proue nothing more plainely, then that which M. <hi>Sidney</hi> and all the learneder sort that haue written of it do pronounce, namely that it is a gift and not an art; I say he proueth it, because making himselfe and many others so cunning in the art, yet he sheweth himself so slender a gift in it, deseruing to be commended as <hi>Martiall</hi> praiseth one that he compares to <hi>Tully:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Carmina quod scribis, musis &amp; Apolline nullo</l>
                  <l>Laudari debes, hoc Ciceronis habes.</l>
               </q> But to come to the purpose, and to speake after the phrase of the common sort, that terme all that is written in verse Poetrie, and rather in scorne then in praise, bestow the name of a Poet on euery base rimer and ballad-maker: this I say of it, and I thinke I say truly, that there are many good lessons to be learned out of it, many good examples to be found in it, many good vses to be had of it, and that therefore it is not, nor ought not to be despised by the wiser sort, but so to be studied and employed, as was intended by the first writers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisers thereof, which is to soften and polish the hard and rough dispositions of men, and make them capable of vertue and good discipline.</p>
            <p>I cannot denie but to vs that are Christians, in respect of the high end of all, which is the health of our soules, not onely Poetrie, but all other studies of Philosophie, are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner vaine and supersluous: yea (as the wise man faith) whatsoeuer is vnder the sunne is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of vanities, and nothing but vanitie. But sith we liue with men and not with saints, and because few men can embrace this strict and stoicall diuinitie, or rather indeed, for that the holy Scriptures, in which those high mysteries of our saluation are contained, are a deepe and profound studie, and not subiect to euery weake capacitie, no nor to the highest wits and iudgements, except they be first illuminate by Gods spirit, or instructed by his teachers and preachers: therefore we do first reade some other authors, making them as it were a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-glasse to the eyes of our mind; and then after we haue gathered more strength, we enter into profounder studies of higher mysteries, hauing first as it were enabled our eyes by long beholding the sunne in a bason of water, at last to looke vpon the sunne it selfe. So we reade how that great <hi>Moses,</hi> whose learning and sanctitie is so renowned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all nations, was first instructed in the learning of the Aegyptians, before he came to that high contemplation of God and familiaritie (as I may so terme it) with God.

If then we may by the example of two such speciall seruants of God, spend some of our yong yeares in studies of humanitie, what better and more sweet study is there for a yong man then Poetrie? specially Heroicall Poesie, that with her sweete statelinesse doth erect the mind, and lift it vp to the consideration of the highest matters; and allureth them, that of themselues would otherwise loth them, to take and swallow and digest the wholsome precepts of Philosophie, and many times euen of the true Diuinitie.<note place="margin">Plutarch de audiendis Poetis.</note> Wherefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> hauing written a whole treatise of the praise of <hi>Homers</hi> workes, and another of reading Poets, doth begin this latter with this comparison, that as men that are sickly and haue weake stomackes or daintie tastes, do many times thinke that flesh most delicate to eate, that is not flesh, and those fishes that be not fish: so yong men (saith he) do like best that Philosophie that is not Philosophie, or that is not deliuered as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie: and such are the pleasant writings of learned Poets, that are the popular Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and the popular Diuines.<note place="margin">Tasso.

            <p>But briefly to answer to the chiefe obiections,<note place="margin">Agrippa de vanitate scientiarum. cap. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> a man of learning and authoritie not to be despised, maketh a bitter inuectiue against Poets and Poesie, and the summe of his reproofe of it is this (which is all that can with any probablitie be said against it:<note place="margin">Foure obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s against Poetry.</note>) That it is a nurse of lies, a pleaser of fooles, a breeder of dangerous errors, and an inticer to wantonnesse. I might here warne those that will vrge this mans authoritie to the disgrace of Poetrie, to take heed (of what calling soeuer they be) least with the same weapon that they thinke to giue Poetrie a blow, they giue themselues a maime. For <hi>Agrippa</hi> taketh his pleasure of greater matters then Poetrie: I maruell how he durst do it, saue that I see he hath done it, he hath spared neither myters nor scepters. The courts of Princes, where vertue is rewarded, iustice maintained, oppressions releeued, he cals them a Colledge of Giants, of tyrants, of oppressors, warriors: the most noble sort of noble men, he termeth cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, bloudie, wicked, and sacrilegious persons. Noble men (and vs poore Gentlemen) that thinke to borrow praise of our auncestors deserts and good fame, he affirmeth to be a race of the sturdier sort of knaues, and licencious liuers. Treasurers and other great officers of the common wealth, with graue counsellers, whose wise heads are the pillars of the state, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth generally to be robbers and peelers of the realme, and priuie traitors that sell their Princes fauours, and rob wel-deseruing seruitors of their reward.

For in my opinion they are said properly to lye, that affirme that to be true that is false: and how other arts can free themselues from this blame let them look that professe them: but Poets neuer affirming any for true, but presenting them to vs as fables and imitations, cannot lye though they would: and because this obiection of lyes is the chiefest, and that vpon which the rest be grounded, I wil stand the longer vpon the clearing thereof.</p>
            <p>The ancient Poets haue indeed wrapped as it were in their writings diuers and sundrie meanings, which they call the sences or mysteries thereof. First of all for the literall sence (as it were the vtmost barke or ryne) they set downe in manner of an historie, the acts and notable exploits of some persons worthie memorie; then in the same fiction, as a second rine and somewhat more fine, as it were nearer to the pith and marrow, they place the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sence, profitable for the actiue life of man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Manie times also vnder the selfesame words they comprehend some true vnderstanding of naturall Philosophíe, or sometime of politike gouernement, and now and then of diuinitie: and these same sences that comprehend so excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we call the Allegorie, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> defineth to be when one thing is told, and by that another is vnderstood. Now let any man iudge, if it be a matter of meane art or wit, to containe in one historicall narration either true or fained, so many, so diuerse, and so deepe conceits: but for making the matter more plaine I will alledge an example thereof.</p>

The Historicall sence is this, <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> by the participation of <hi>Iupiters</hi> vertues that were in him; or rather comming of the stock of one of the kings of Creet, or Athens so called; slue <hi>Gorgon</hi> a tyrant in that countrey (<hi>Gorgon</hi> in greeke signifieth earth) and was for his vertuous parts exalted by men vp into heauen. Morally it signifieth thus much, <hi>Perseus</hi> a wise man, sonne of <hi>Iupiter</hi> endewed with vertue from aboue, slayeth sinne and vice, a thing base and earthly; signified by <hi>Gorgon,</hi> and so mounteth to the skie of vertue: It signifies in one kinde of Allegorie thus much; the mind of man being gotten by God, and so the childe of God, killing and vanquishing the earthlinesse of this Gorgonicall nature, ascendeth vp to the vnderstanding of heauenly things, of high things, of eternall things, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation consisteth the perfection of man: this is the naturall allegorie, because man, one of
<pb facs="tcp:7215:6"/>
the chiefe works of nature: It hath also a more high and heauenly Allegorie, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly nature, daughter of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> procuring with her continuall motion, corruption and mortalitie in the interiour bodies, seuered it selfe at last from these earthly bodies, and flew vp on high, and there remaineth for euer. It hath also another Theologicall Allegorie, that the angelicall nature, daughter of the most high God the creator of all things; killing and ouercomming all bodily substance, signified by <hi>Gorgon,</hi> ascended into heauen: the like infinite Allegories I could picke out of other Poeticall fictions, saue that I would auoid tediousnesse. It sufficeth me therefore to note this, that the men of greatest learning and highest wit in the auncient times, did of purpose conceale these deepe mysteries of learning, and as it were couer them with the veile of fables and verse for sundrie cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: one cause was, that they might not be rashly abused by prophane wits, in whom sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is corrupted, like good wine in a bad vessell: another cause why they wrote in verse, was conseruation of the memorie of their precepts, as we see yet the generall rules almost of euerie art, not so much as husbandrie, but they are of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ner recited and better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in verse then in prose: another, and a principall cause of all, is to be able with one kinde of meate and one dish (as I may so call it) to feed diuers-tastes. For the weaker ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities will feed themselues with the pleasantnesse of the historie and sweetnes of the verse, some that haue stronger stomackes will as it were take a further tast of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralisence, a third sort more high conceited then they, will digest the Allegorie: so as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it hath bene thought by men of verie good iudgement, such manner of Poeticall writing was an excellent way to preserue all kinde of learning from that corruption which now it is come to since they left that mysticall writing of verse. Now though I know the example and authoritie of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> be still vrged against this, who tooke to themselues another manner of writing: first I may say indeed that lawes were made for poore men, and not for Princes, for these two great Princes of Philosophie, brake that former allowed manner of writing, yet <hi>Plato</hi> still preserued the fable, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the verse. <hi>Aristotle</hi> though reiecting both, yet retained still a kinde of obscuritie, insomuch he answered <hi>Alexander,</hi> who reprooued him in a sort, for publishing the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred secrets of Philosophie, that he had set forth his bookes in a sort, and yet not set them forth; meaning that they were so obscure that they would be vnderstood of few, except they came to him for instructions; or else without they were of verie good capacitie and studious of Philosophie. But (as I say) <hi>Plato</hi> howsoeuer men would make him an enemie of Poetrie (because he found indeed iust fault with the abuses of some comicall Poets of his time, or some that sought to set vp new and strange religions) yet you see he kept stil l that principall part of Poetrie, which is fiction and imitation; and as for the other part of Poetrie which is verse, though he vsed it not, yet his maister <hi>Socrates</hi> euen in his old age wrote certaine verses, as <hi>Plutarke</hi> restifieth: but because I haue named the two parts of Poetrie, namely inuention or fiction, and verse, let vs see how well we can au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorise the vse of both these. First for fiction, against which as I told before, many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h, calling it by the foule name of lying, though notwithstanding, as I then said, it is farthest from it: <hi>Demosthenes</hi> the famous and renowned Orator, when he would perswade the Athenians to warre against <hi>Philip,</hi> told them a solemne tale how the Wolues on a time sent Ambassadors to the sheepe, offering them peace if they would deliuer vp the dogs that kept their folds, with all that long circumstance (needelesse to be repeated) by which he perswaded them far more strongly then if he should haue told them in plaine termes, that <hi>Philip</hi> sought to bereaue them of their chiefe bulwarks &amp; defences, to haue the better abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ouerthrow them. But what need we fetch an authority so far off from heathen authors, that haue many neerer hand both in time and in place?

and more godly vses: the graue Bishop answered it in this kinde of Poeticall parable: He said there was an axe that wanting a helue came to a thicke and huge ouergrown wood, and be sought some of the great okes in that wood, to spare him so much timber as to make him a handle or helue, promising that if he might finde that fauour, he would in recompence thereof, haue great regard in preseruing that wood, in pruning the branches, in cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e, he so laid about him, and so pared away both timber and top and lop, that in short space of a woodland he made it a champion, and made her liberalitie the instrument of her ouerthrow.</p>
            <p>Now though this Bishop had no very good successe with his parable, yet it was so farre from being counted a lye, that it was plainly seene soone after that the same axe did both hew downe those woods by the roots, and pared him off by the head, and was a peece of Prophecie, as well as a peece of Poetrie: and indeed Prophets and Poets haue bene thought to haue a great affinitie, as the name <hi>Vates</hi> in Latin doth testifie. But to come againe to this manner of fiction or parable, the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> reprouing king <hi>Dauid</hi> for his great sinne of adulterie and murther, doth he not come to him with a pretie parable, of a poore man and his lambe that lay in his bosome, and eat of his bread, and the rich man that had whole flocks of his owne would needs take it from him? In which as it is euident it was but a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, so it were vnreuerent and almost blasphemous to say it was a lye. But to go higher, did not our Sauiour himselfe speake in parables? as that deuine parable of the sower, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable parable of the Prodigall sonne, that dreadfull parable of <hi>Diues</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> though I know of this last, many of the fathers hold that it is a storie indeed, and no parable. But in the rest it is manifest, that he that was all holinesse, all wisedome, all truth, vsed parables, and euen such as discreet Poets vse, where a good and honest and wholsome Allegorie is hidden in a pleasant and pretie fiction, <note place="margin">

               </note> and therefore for that part of Poetrie of Imitation, I thinke no body will make any question, but it is not onely allowable, but godly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, if the Poets ill handling of it doe nor marre and peruert the good vse of it. The other part of Poetrie, which is Verse, as it were the clothing or ornament of it, hath many good vses; of the helpe of memorie I spake somewhat before; for the words being couched together in due order, measure, and number, one doth as it were bring on another, as my selfe haue often proued, and so I thinke do many beside, (though for my owne part I can rather bost of the marring a good memorie, then of hauing one,) yet I haue euer found, that Verse is easier to learne, and farre better to preserue in memorie, then is prose. Another speciall grace in Verse is the forcible manner of phrase, in which if it be well made, it farre excelleth loose speech or prose: a third is the pleasure and sweetenesse to the eare, which makes the discourse pleasant vnto vs often time when the matter it selfe is harsh and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable; for my owne part I was neuer yet so good a husband, to take any delight to hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This signifies the selfesame man to whom the tale is told, that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in plentie, and yet his miserable minde barres him of the vse of it: As my selfe knew and I am sure many remember Iustice <hi>Randall</hi> of London, a man passing impotent in body but much more in mind, that leauing behind him a thousand pounds of gold in a chest ful of old boots and shoes, yet was so miserable, that at my Lord Maiors dinner they say he would put vp a widgen for his supper, and many a good meale he did take of his franke neighbour the widdow <hi>Penne</hi>: but to come to the matter, this same great sinne that is laide to Poetrie of pleasing fooles, <note place="margin">

               </note> is fufficiently answered if it be worth the answering. Now for the bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of errours which is the third Obiection, I see not why it should breed any when none is bound to beleeue that they write, nor they looke not to haue their fictions beleeued in the literall sence, aud therefore he that well examine whence errours spring, shall finde the writers of prose &amp; not of verse, the authors and maintainers of them, and this point I count so manifest as it needes no proofe. The last reproofe is lightnes and wantonnes, this is indeed an Obiection of some importance, sith as Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> confesseth, <hi>Cupido</hi> is crept euen into the Heroicall Poemes, &amp; consequently maketh that also, subiect to this reproofe: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the beginning not partially to praise Poesie, but plainly and honestly to confesse that, that might truely be obiected against it, and if any thing may be, sure it is this lasciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse; yet this I will say, that of all kinde of Poesie, the Heroicall is least infected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. The other kindes I will rather excuse then defend, though of all the kindes of Poesie it may be sayd, where any scurrilitie and lewdnesse is found, there Poetrie doth not abuse vs, but writers haue abused Poetrie. And brieflie to examine all the kindes: First the Tragicall is meerely free from it, as representing onely the cruell and lawlesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Princes, mouing nothing but pitie or detestation. The Comicall (whatsoeuer foolish play makers make it offend in this kind) yet being rightly vsed, it represents them
<pb facs="tcp:7215:7"/>
so as to make the vice scorned and not embraced. The Satyrike is meerly free from it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholy occupied in mannerly and couertly reprouing of all vices. The Elegie is stil mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: as for the Pastorall with the Sonnet or Epigramme, though many times they sauour of wantonnesse and loue and toying, and now and then breaking the rules of Poetrie, go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to plaine scurrilitie, yet euen the worst of them may be not ill applied, and are, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, too delightfull, in so much as <hi>Martial</hi> saith,

               <hi>Lucrecia</hi> (by which he signifies any chast matron) will blush and be ashamed to reade a lasciuious booke: but how? not except <hi>Brutus</hi> be by, that is, if any graue man should see her reade it; but if <hi>Brutus</hi> turne his backe, she will to it againe and reade it all. But to end this part of my Apologie, as I count and conclude Heroicall Poesie allowable, and to be read and studied without all exception: so may I boldly say, that Tragedies well handled, be a most worthy kind of Poesie; that Comedies may make men see and shame at their owne faults, that the rest may be so written and so read, as much pleasure and some profite may be gathered out of them. And for mine owne part, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> writeth of <hi>Virgil,</hi> so I beleeue, that the reading of a good Heroicall Poeme may make a man both wiser and honester: and for Tragedies, to omit other famous Tragedies, that that which was played at Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> in Cambridge, of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, would moue (I thinke) <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tyrant, and terrifie all tyrannous minded men, from following their foolish ambitious humors, seeing how his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition made him kill his brother, his nephewes, his wife, beside infinite others; and last of all after a short and troublesome raigne, to end his miserable life, and to haue his bodie har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after his death. Then for Comedies: how full of harmelesse mirth is our Cambridge Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantius? and the Oxford Bellum Grammaticale? or to speake of a London Comedie, how much good matter, yea and matter of state, is there in that Comedie called the play of the Cards? in which it is shewed how foure Parasiticall knaues robbe the foure principall vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Realme, <hi>videl,</hi> the vocation of Souldiers, Schollers, Merchants and Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Of which Comedie I cannot forget the saying of a notable wise counseller that is now dead, who when some (to sing <hi>Placebo</hi>) aduised that it should be forbidden, because it was somewhat too plaine, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir Frances VValsingham.</hi>
               </note> and indeed as the old saying is, <hi>sooth boord is no boord,</hi> yet he would haue it allowed, adding it was fit that <hi>they which do that they should not, should heare that they wold not.</hi> Finally, if Comedies may be so made as the beholders may be bettered by them, without all doubt all other sorts of Poetrie may bring their profite as they do bring delight; and if all, then much more the chiefe of all, which by all mens consent is the Heroicall. And thus much be said for Poesie.</p>
            <p>Now for this Poeme of <hi>Orlando Furioso,</hi> which as I haue heard, hath bene disliked by some, though by few of any wit or iudgement, it followes that I say somewhat in defence thereof, <note place="margin">

            <p>This is a great praise, comming from so great a Prince. For later times, to omit <hi>Scaliger,</hi> whom I recited before, that affirmeth the reading of <hi>Virgil</hi> may make a man honest and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: that excellent Italian Poet <hi>Dant</hi> professeth plainly, that when he wandred out of the right way (meaning thereby, when he liued fondly and loosly) <hi>Virgil</hi> was the first that made him looke into himselfe, and reclaime himselfe from that same dangerous and leud course. But what need we further witnesse, do we not make our children reade it commonly before they can vnderstand it, as a testimonie that we do generally approue it? and yet we see old men studie it, as a proofe that they do specially admire it: so as one writes very pretily, that children do wade in <hi>Uirgil,</hi> and yet strong men do swim in it.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this to the praise of mine author, as I said before, so I say still, whatsoeuer is praise-worthy in <hi>Virgil,</hi> is plentifully to be found in <hi>Ariosto,</hi> and some things that <hi>Virgil</hi> could not haue for the ignorance of the age he liued in, you find in my author, sprinkled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all his worke, as I will very briefly note, and referre you for the rest to the booke it selfe. The deuout and Christian demeanor of <hi>Charlemaine</hi> in the 14. booke with his prayer,
<q>
                  <l>Non vogliatua bonta per mio fallire</l>
                  <l>Ch'l tuo popol fidele babbia a patire, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the beginning of the 17. booke that would be seeme any pulpit:
<q>
                  <l>Il giusto Dio quando i peccati nostri.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But aboue all, that in the 41. booke of the conuersion of <hi>Rogero</hi> to the Christian Religion, where the Hermit speaketh to him, containing in effect a ful instruction against presumption and despaire, which I haue set downe thus in English,
<q>
                  <l>Now (as I said) this wise that Hermit spoke,</l>
                  <l>And part doth comfort him, and part doth checke:</l>
                  <l>He blameth him that in that pleasant yoke</l>
                  <l>He had so long deferd to put his necke,</l>
                  <l>But did to wrath his maker still prouoke:</l>
                  <l>And did not come at his first call and becke,</l>
                  <l>But still did hide himselfe away from God,</l>
                  <l>Vntill he saw him comming with his rod.</l>
                  <l>Then did he comfort him, and make him know,</l>
                  <l>That grace is nere denide to such as aske,</l>
                  <l>As do the workmen in the Gospell show,</l>

                  <l>The pardon of his sinnes, yet nere the later</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:7215:8"/>These and infinite places full of Christen exhortation, doctrine and example, I could quote out of the book, saue that I hasten to an end, and it would be needles to those that wil not read them in the booke it selfe, and superfluous to those that will: but most manifest it is and not to be denyed, that in this point my author is to be preferred before all the ancient Poets, in which are mentioned so many false Gods, and of them so many fowle deeds, their contentions, their adulteries, their incest, as were both obscenous in recitall, and hurtfull in example: though indeed those whom they tearmed Gods, were certaine great Princes that committed such enormous faults, as great Princes in late ages (that loue still to be cald Gods of the earth) do often commit. But now it may be and is by some obiected, that although he write Christianly in some places, yet in other some, he is too lasciuious, as in that of the bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Frier, in <hi>Alcina</hi> and <hi>Rogeros</hi> copulation, in <hi>Anselmus</hi> his <hi>Giptian,</hi> in <hi>Richardetto</hi> his meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosis, in mine hosts tale of <hi>Astolfo,</hi> and some few places beside; alas if this be a fault, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him this one fault; though I doubt to many of you (gentle readers) will be too exorable in this point; yea me thinks I see some of you searching already for these places of the book, and you are halfe offended that I haue not made some directions that you might finde out and read them immediatly. But I beseech you stay a while, and as the Italian saith <hi>Pian pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> fayre and softly, and take this caueat with you, to read them as my author meant them to breed detestation and not delectation: remember when you read of the old lecherous Frier, that a fornicator is one of the things that God hateth. When you read of <hi>Alcina,</hi> thinke how <hi>Ioseph</hi> fled from his intising mistres; when you light on <hi>Anselmus</hi> tale, learne to loath beastly couetousnes, when on <hi>Richardetto,</hi> know that sweet meate will haue sowre sawce, when on mine hosts tale (if you will follow my counsell) turne ouer the leafe and let it alone, although euen that lewd tale may bring some men profit, and I haue heard that it is already (and perhaps not vnfitly) termed the comfort of cuckolds. But as I say, if this be a fault, then <hi>Virgil</hi> committed the same fault in <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> entertainement: &amp; if some will say, he tels that mannerly and couertly, how will they excuse that, where <hi>Vulcan</hi> was inteated by <hi>Venus</hi> to make an armour for <hi>Aeneas?</hi>

            <p>Briefly, <hi>Aristotle</hi> and the best censurers of Poesie, would haue the <hi>Epopeia,</hi> that is, the heroicall Poem, should ground on some historie, and take some short time in the same to bewtifie with his Poetrie: so doth mine Author take the storie of K. <hi>Charls</hi> the great, and doth not exceed a yeare or therabout in his whole worke. Secondly they hold, that nothing should be fayned vtterly incredible.

Iohn</hi> is fayned to do, since the Church holdeth that Prophets both aliue and dead, haue done mightie great miracles. Thirdly, they would haue an heroicall Poem (aswell as a Tragedie) to be full of <hi>Peripetia,</hi> which I interpret an agniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on of some vnlooked for fortune either good or bad, and a sudd en change thereof: of this what store there be the reader shall quickly finde. 'As for apt similitudes, for passions well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, of loue, of pitie, of hate, of wrath, a blind man may see, if he can but heare, that this worke is full of them.</p>
            <p>There follows onely two reproofs, which I rather interpret two peculiar praises of this writer aboue all that wrote before him in this kind: One, that he breaks off narrations ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie abruptly, so as indeed a loose vnattentiue reader, will hardly carrie away any part of the storie: but this doubtlesse is a point of great art, to draw a man with a continuall thirst to reade ouer the whole worke, and toward the end of the booke, to close vp the diuerse mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters briefly and cleanly. If <hi>S. Philip Sidney</hi> had counted this a fault, he would not haue done so himselfe in his Arcadia. Another fault is, that he speaketh so much in his owne person by digression, which they say also is against the rules of Poetrie, because neither <hi>Homer</hi> nor <hi>Virgil</hi> did it. Me thinks it is a sufficient defence to say, <hi>Ariosto</hi> doth it; sure I am, it is both delightfull and verie profitable, and an excellent breathing place for the reader, and euen as if a man walked in a faire long alley, to haue a seat or resting place here and there is easie and commodious: but if at the same seate were planted some excellent tree, that not onely with the shade should keepe vs from the heat, but with some pleasant and right wholsome fruite should allay our thirst and comfort our stomacke, we would thinke it for the time a litle pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice: so are <hi>Ariostos</hi> morals and pretie digressions sprinkled through his long worke, to the no lesse pleasure then profit of the reader. And thus much be spoken for defence of mine Author, which was the second part of my Apologie.</p>
            <p>Now remaines the third part of it, in which I promised to speake somwhat for my selfe, which part, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The third part of the Apologie.</hi>
               </note> though it haue most need of an Apologie both large and substantiall; yet I will run it ouer both shortly and slightly, because indeed the nature of the thing it selfe is such, that the more one doth say, the lesse he shall seeme to say; and men are willinger to praise that in another man, which himselfe shall debase, then that which he shall seeme to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Certainly if I should confesse or rather professe, that my verse is vnartificiall, the stile rude, the phrase barbarous, the meeter vnpleasant, many more would beleeue it to be so, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would imagine that I thought them so: for this same <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or selfe pleasing is so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon a thing, as the more a man protests himselfe to be from it, the more we wil charge him with it. Wherefore let me take thus much vpon me, that admit it haue many of the forenamed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, and many not named, yet as writing goes now a dayes, it may passe among the rest; and as I haue heard a friend of mine (one verie iudicious in the beautie of a woman) say of a Ladie whom he meant to praise, that she had a low forhead, a great nose, a wide mouth, a long visage, and yet all these put together, she seemed to him a verie well, fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red woman: so I hope, and I finde alreadie some of my partiall friends, that what seuerall
<pb facs="tcp:7215:9"/>
imperfections soeuer they finde in this translation, yet taking all together they allow it, or at least wise they reade it, which is a great argument of their liking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir Thomas Moore</hi> a man of great wisedome and learning, but yet a litle enclined (as good wits are many times) to scoffing, when one had brought him a booke of some shallow dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and preassed him very hard to haue his opinion of it, aduised the partie to put it into verse; the plaine meaning man in the best maner he could he did so, and a twelue-month after at the least, came with it to <hi>Sir Thomas,</hi> who slightly perusing it, gaue it this <hi>encomium,</hi> that now there was rime in it, but afore it had neither rime nor reason. If any man had ment to serue me so, yet I haue preuented him; for sure I am he shal finde rime in mine, &amp; if he be not voyd of reason, he shal finde reason to. Though for the matter, I can challenge no praise, hauing but borrowed it, and for the verse I do challenge none, being a thing that euery body that neuer scarce bayted their horse at the Vniuersitie take vpon them to make. It is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that if I would haue employed that time that I haue done vpon this, vpon some inuep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mine owne, I could haue by this made it haue risen to a iust volume, and if I would haue done as many spare not to do, flowne verie high with stolen fethers. But I had rather men should see and know that I borrow all, then that I steale any: and I would wish to be called rather one of the not worst translators, then one of the meaner makers. Specially sith the Earle of Surrey, and <hi>Sir Thomas Wiat,</hi> that are yet called the first refiners of the English tong, were both translators out of Italian. Now for those that count it such a contemptible and trifling matter to translate, I will but say to them as <hi>M. Bartholomew Ciarke</hi> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent learned man, and a right good translator, saith in manner of a prettie challenge, in his Preface (as I remember) vpon the Courtier, which booke he translated out of Italian into Latin. You (saith he) that thinke it such a toy, lay aside my booke, and take my author in your hand, and trie a leafe or such a matter, and compare it with mine. If I should say so, there would be enow that would quickly put me downe perhaps; but doubtlesse he might bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say it, for I thinke none could haue mended him. But as our English prouerbe saith, many talke of <hi>Robin Hood</hi> that neuer shot in his bow, and some correct <hi>Magnificat,</hi> that know not <hi>quid significat.</hi> For my part I will thanke them that will amend any thing that I haue done amisse, nor I haue no such great conceipt of that I haue done, but that I thinke much in it is to be mended; and hauing dealt playnly with some of my plaine dealing friends, to tell me frankly what they heard spoken of it (for indeed I suffered some part of the printed copies to go among my friends, and some more perhaps went against my wil) I was told that these in effect were the faults were found with it. Some graue men misliked that I should spend so much good time on such a trifling worke as they deemed a Poeme to be. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Foure faults found in this worke.</hi>
               </note> Some more nicely, found fault with so many two sillabled and three sillabled rimes. Some (not vndeseruedly) reproued the fantasticalnes of my notes, in which they say I haue strained my selfe to make mention of some of my kindred and friends, that might verie well be left out. And one fault more there is, which I will tell my selfe, though many would neuer finde it; and that is; I haue cut short some of his Cantos, in leauing out many staues of them, and sometimes put the matter of two or three staues into one. To these reproofes I shall pray you gentle and noble Readers with patience heare my defence, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer to the first.</hi>
               </note> and then I will end. For the first reproofe, etiher it is alreadie excused, or it will neuer be excused; for I haue I thinke suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proued, both the art to be allowable, and this worke to be commendable: yet I will tell you an accident that happened vnto my selfe. When I was entred a prettie way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the translation, about the seuenth booke, comming to write that where <hi>Melissa</hi> in the person of <hi>Rogeros</hi> Tutor, comes and reproues <hi>Rogero</hi> in the 4. staffe:
<q>
                  <l>Was it for this, that I in youth thee fed</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:7215:10"/>
Straight I began to thinke, <note place="margin">

               </note> that my Tutor, a graue and learned man, and one of a verie au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere life, might say to me in like sort, Was it for this, that I read <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> to you, and instructed you so carefully both in Greek and Latin? to haue you now becom a transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Italian toyes? But while I thought thus, I was aware, that it was no toy that could put such an honest and serious consideration into my minde. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The second.</hi>
               </note> Now for them that finde fault with polysyllable meeter, me thinke they are like those that blame men for putting suger in their wine, and chide too bad about it, and say they marre al, but yet end with Gods blessing on their hearts. For indeed if I had knowne their diets, I could haue saued some of my cost, at least some of my paine; for when a verse ended with <hi>ciuillitie,</hi> I could easier after the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient manner of rime, haue made <hi>see,</hi> or <hi>flee,</hi> or <hi>decree</hi> to answer it, leauing the accent vpon the last syllable, then hunt after three syllabled words to answer it with <hi>facillitie, gentillitie, tranquillitie, hostillitie, scurrillitie, debillitie, agillitie, fragillitie, nobillitie, mobillitie,</hi> which who mislike, may tast lampe oyle with their eares. And as for two syllabled meeters, they be so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued in other languages, that the French call them the feminine rime, as the sweeter: and the one syllable the masculin. But in a word to answer this, and to make them for euer hold their peaces of this point; <hi>Sir Philip Sidney</hi> not onely vseth them, but affecteth them: <hi>signifie, dignifie: shamed is, named is, blamed is: hide away, bide away.</hi> Though if my many blotted papers that I haue made in this kinde, might affoord me authoritie to giue a rule of it, I would say that to part them with a one syllable meeter betweene them, would giue it best grace. For as men vse to sow with the hand and not with the whole sacke, so I would haue the eare fed but not cloyed with these pleasing and sweet falling meeters. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The third.</hi>
               </note> For the third reproofe about the notes, sure they were a worke (as I may so call it) of supererogation, and I would wish sometimes they had bin left out, and the rather, if I be in such faire possibilitie to be thought a foole or fantasticall for my labour. True it is, I added some notes to the end of euery Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, euen as if some of my friends and my selfe reading it together (and so it fell out indeed many times) had after debated vpon them, what had bene most worthie consideration in them, and so oftimes immediatly i set it down. And whereas I make mention here and there of some of mine owne frends and kin, I did it the rather, because <hi>Plutarke</hi> in one place spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Homer,</hi> partly lamenteth, and partly blameth him, that writing so much as he did, yet in none of his workes there was any mention made, or so much as inkling to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of what stocke he was, of what kindred, of what towne, nor saue for his language, of what countrey. Excuse me then if I in a worke that may perhaps last longer then a better thing, and being not ashamed of my kindred, name them here and there to no mans offence, though I meant not to make euerie body so far of my counsell why I did it, till I was told that some person of some reckening noted me of a little vanitie for it: and thus much for that point.</p>
            <p>For my omitting and abreuiating some things, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The fourth.</hi>
               </note> either in matters impertinent to vs, or in some too tedious flatteries of persons that we neuer heard of, if I haue done ill, I craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; for sure I did it for the best. But if any being studious of the Italian, would for his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderstanding compare them, the first sixe bookes saue a little of the third, will stand him in steed. But yet I would not haue any man except, that I should obserue his phrase so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an interpreter, nor the matter so carefully, as if it had bene a storie, in which to varie were as great a sin, as it were simplicitie in this to go word for word. But now to conclude, I shall pray you all that haue troubled your selues to read this my triple Apologie, to accept my labors, and to excuse my errors, if with no other thing, at least with the name of youth (which commonly hath need of excuses) and so presuming this pardon to be granted, we shall part good frends. <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are peraduenture many men, and some of those both graue and godly men, that in respect they count all Poetrie as meerly tending to wantonnesle and vanitie, will at the very first sight reiect this booke, and not onely not allow, but blame and reproue the trauel taken in letting forth the same in our mother tongue. And surely for such censurers as will condemne without hearing the cause pleaded, I can be well content to haue them spare the labor in reading, which they thinke I haue lost in writing; and appealing from them, if not to higher at least to more indifferent iudges, namely such as wil vouchsafe to heare what can be spoken in defence of the matter, and then will yeeld (as wise men euer should do) to the stronger reason: I do to them direct this my short aduertisement, which (because all that may reade this booke are not of equall capacities) I will endeuor to explane more plainly, then for the learned sort had haply bene requisite.</p>
            <p>And first if any haue this scruple, that it might be hurtfull for his soule or conscience, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of the matter of the book tending to vertue.</hi>
               </note> to reade a booke of Poetry, as though it might alien his mind from vertue and religion, I referre him (beside many other excellent mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, both in defence and praise thereof) to a litle briefe treatise in the beginning of this booke, written by me generally in defence of Poemes, and specially of this present worke, which I dare affirme to be neither vicious nor profane, but apt to breed the quite contrary effects, if a great fault be not in the readers owne bad disposition.</p>
            <p>Secondly I haue in the marginall notes quoted the apt similitudes, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The marginall notes.</hi>
               </note> and pithie sentences or adages, with the best descriptions, and the excellent imitations, and the places and authors from whence they are taken.</p>

               </note> I haue set directions in the margent, where to find the continuance of euery such storie, though I would not wish any to reade them in that order at the first reading, but if any thinke them worthy the twise reading, then he may the second time not vnconueniently vse it, if the meane matter betweene the so deuided stories (vpon which commonly they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend) be not quite out of his memorie.</p>
            <p>Also (according to the Italian maner) I haue in a staffe of eight verses comprehended the contents of euery Book or Canto, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The contents of euery booke.</hi>
               </note> in the beginning thereof, which hath two good vses, one to vnderstand the picture the perfecter, the other to remember the storie the better.</p>
            <p>As for the pictures, they are all cut in brasse, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The pictures.</hi>
               </note> and most of them by the best workmen in that kind, that haue bin in this land this many yeares: yet I will not praise them too much, because I gaue direction for their making, and in regard thereof, I may be thought partiall; but this I may truly say, that (for mine owne part) I haue not seene any made in England better, nor (indeed) any of this kind in any booke, except it were a treatise set forth by that profound man master Broughton the list yeare, vpon the Reuelation, in which there are some three or foure pretie pictures (in octauo) cut in brasse very workmanly. As for other bookes that I haue seene in this Realme, either in Latine or English with pictures, as Liuie, Gesner, Alciats emblemes, a booke <hi>de Spectris</hi> in Latine, and in our tongue the Chronicles, the booke of Martyrs, the booke of hauking and hunting, and M. Whitneys ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Emblemes, yet all their figures are cut in wood, and none in metall, and in that respect inferiour to these, at least (by the old prouerbe) the more cost, the more worship.</p>
            <p>The vse of the picture is euident, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The vse of the picture and the perspectiue.</hi>
               </note> which is, that (hauing read ouer the booke) you may reade it (as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine) in the very picture; and one thing is to be noted, which euery one (haply) will not obserue, namely the perspectiue in euery figure. For the personages of men, the shapes of horses, and such like, are made large at the bottome, and lesser vpward, as if you were to behold all the same in a plaine, that which is nearest seemes greatest, and the fardest shewes smallest, which is the chiefe art in picture.</p>
            <p>If the name of any man, <note place="margin">

               </note> woman, country, towne, horse, or weapon seeme strange to any, I haue made a table where to find it. And in the same table, a direction for the seuerall tales, where to begin and end, those that may conueniently be read single, of which kind there are many, and those not vnpleasant.</p>
            <p>Lastly, at the end of euery Book or Canto, because the Reader may take not only delight, but profit in reading, I haue noted in all (as occasion is offered) the Morall, the Historie, the Allegorie, and the Allusion.</p>
            <p>The Morall, that we may apply it to our owne manners and disposition, to the amendment of the same. <note place="margin">

And whereas first <hi>Bradamant,</hi> and after <hi>Renaldo</hi> interrupt <hi>Sacrapant</hi> of his lasciuious purpose, may be noted, both the weake holdfast that men haue of worldly pleasures, as also how the heauens do euer fauour chast desires. Lastly, in the two fountaines may be noted the two notable contrarieties of the two affections, of loue and disdaine, that infinite sorts of people daily tast of, while they runne wandring in that inextricable labyrinth of loue.</p>
            <p>Concerning the historie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Historie.</hi>
               </note> we find that in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the great (called <hi>Charlemaine</hi>) sonne of <hi>Pepin</hi> king of France, the Turkes with a great power inuaded Christendome, Spaine being then out of the faith, (as some part thereof was euen within these four score yeares, namely Granada, which was held by the Moores.) And one <hi>Marcus Antonius Sabellicus</hi> writeth, that for certaintie there liued in that time of <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> many of those famous Palladines, that are in this worke so often named, and especially he maketh mention of <hi>Renaldo</hi> and <hi>Orlando,</hi> affirming that they were indeed very martiall men, and how <hi>Charles</hi> obtained great victories by their seruice; and namely he talleth of one <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raw</hi> a Spaniard of great stature and strength, who tooke certaine Frenchmen prisoners, afterward rescued by <hi>Orlando,</hi> which <hi>Orlando</hi> fought with him hand to hand two whole dayes, and the second vanquisht him. Further, the same author affirmeth, that the same <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> for his great fauour shewed to the Church of Rome, was by <hi>Leo</hi> the third named Emperour of Rome: and that he was a iust, a fortunate, and a mercifull Prince, and one that within Europe as well as without did attaine great conquests, suppressing the violent gouernement of the Lombards, and taming the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saxons, Huns and Baudrians, and conquering a great part of Spaine: all which testimonies shew, that the ground of this Poeme is true, as I shall haue particular occasion in sundry of the books ensuing to note: and thus much for the story.</p>
            <p>For the allegory,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Allegorie.</hi>
               </note> in this Canto I find not much to be said, except one should be so curious to search for an allegory where none is intended by the author himself: yet an allegory may not vnfitly be gathered of the description of Bayardos follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Angelica,</hi> which may thus be taken. Bayardo a strong horse, without rider or gouernor, is likened to the desire of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that runs furiously after <hi>Angelica,</hi> as it were after pleasure or honor, or whatsoeuer man doth most inordinately affect.</p>
            <p>Likewise in that <hi>Angelica</hi> flieth from <hi>Renaldo,</hi> we may take an allegorical instruction, that the temtations of the flesh are ouercome, chiefly by flying from them, as the Scripture it selfe teacheth, saying, Resist the diuel, but fly fornication.</p>
            <p>Further, in that Bayardo striketh at <hi>Sacrapant,</hi> but yeeldeth to <hi>Angelica,</hi> it may be noted how the courage of our minds that cannot be abated with any force, are often subdued by flatterie and gentle vsage, till they be in the end euen ridden as it were with slauerie.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Renaldo</hi> followes <hi>Angelica</hi> on foote, some haue noted thereby to be meant sensualitie, that is euer in base and earthly, or rather beastly affections, neuer looking vpward.</p>

By <hi>Renaldos</hi> obedience to <hi>Charles</hi> in going on embassage notwithstanding all his priuat affaires and affections, we may take example of dutiful obedience to our lawfull Prince.

            <p>For the Historie of this Canto,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Storie.</hi>
               </note> I will not affirme too precisely, for I find not in any credible author of <hi>Renaldos</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage into England, neither is it very likely, if the King of England were then in Paris, (as in another place of this worke is affirmed) that a Peere of France should be sent hither, and not rather some English noble man sent from the King to his other subiects in England, with directions and instructions from him.</p>
            <p>That Paris and <hi>Charles</hi> himselfe were in some distresse about that time, is not vnprobable, and that the Turkes at their first arriuall preuailed very farre against the Christians, though it lasted but a while.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Rogero,</hi> whom he toucheth in this booke, and that is so much spoken of in this w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Allegorie.</hi>
               </note> as I noted in the first booke of Bayardo, so the same is still continued or rather repeated, namely, that the horse, by which is meant mans feruent and furious appetite, which is more plainly signified where it is said of the horse:
<q>
                  <l>His going onely was to this intent,</l>
                  <l>To shew his master where the damsell went.</l>
               </q> So that still this vnbridled desire figured by Bayardo, leades <hi>Renaldo</hi> on foote, whereby is vnderstood sensualitie to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue <hi>Angelica,</hi> with a base desire of the most base pleasure.</p>
            <p>In the shield, whose light amazed the lookers on, and made them fall downe astonied, may be Allegorically meant the great pompes of the world, that make shining shewes in the bleared eyes of vaine people, and blind them, and make them to admire and fall downe before them, hauing indeed nothing but shining titles without vertue, like painted sheaths with leaden weapons, or like straw without the graine: either else may be meant the flaring beauties of some gorgeous women, that astonish the eyes of weake minded men, apt to receiue such louing impressions, as <hi>Atlantas</hi> shield did amaze their senses that beheld it.</p>
            <p>For the Allegorie of the horse, what is meant thereby, I reserue to another place, where I will follow it more at large then this little space will giue me leaue, and in that booke where he is more treated of.</p>
            <p>The Allusion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Allusion.</hi>
               </note> to which this flying horse is referred, and from whence it is taken, is from <hi>Pegasus,</hi> the flying horse that <hi>Pindar</hi> writes of, bred of the bloud of <hi>Medusa,</hi> on which beast <hi>Bellerophon</hi> was wont to ride, flying the false accusation of <hi>Pretus</hi> wife.</p>

            <p>Concerning the victorie that this <hi>Hippolito</hi> had of the Venetians, I shall haue more occasion to speake of it in the 40. booke.</p>
            <p>The two that <hi>Bradamant</hi> asketh <hi>Melyssa</hi> of, were brothers to <hi>Alfonso</hi> Duke of Ferrara, their names are <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Lulio</hi>: the storie is this. It happened that being all yong men, <hi>Hippolito</hi> and one of these yonger brothers fel both in loue with one Curtesan, but she entertained the loue of the yonger with most kindnes; whereupon <hi>Hippolito</hi> asked her one day very instantly, what it was that moued her to prefer his brother asore him; and she said it was his beautifull eie: wherupon <hi>Hippolito</hi> made some of his pages to thrust out his eies. Notwithstanding he afterward recouered his eies, and finding no redresse by complaining to <hi>Alfonso,</hi> he and one other brother conspired to kill him; but at the time of the execution, their hearts failed them, or their minds altered: and after the conspiracie being discouered, they were kept in perpetuall prison.</p>
            <p>And in this he alludes to that of <hi>Marcellus</hi> in <hi>Virgil, Luctus ac quaeretuorum.</hi>

            <p>In this fourth booke, whereas dissembling is praised, we may note in what sort and with what persons it is allowable,<note place="margin">Morall.</note> seeing generally in it selfe it is a most vnnoble and vnworthy qualitie. In that <hi>Bradamant</hi> by the ring doth discouer <hi>Atlantas</hi> inchantments, and frustrate all his purpose, we nay note, how reason tempered with courage, prevailes to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of all deceits and subtill practices. In <hi>Rogero,</hi> that was caried away vnawares by the winged horse, we haue an example to make vs take heed of rash &amp; vnaduised enterprises. In <hi>Renaldos</hi> speech, condemning the rigor of the law, that adultery was punished by death in women rather then in men, as we may with him instly mislike such partialitie in lawes: so we may note the manner and phrase of speech of yong gentlemen (as <hi>Renaldo</hi> was) that make so light of their sweet sinne of lechery, as they call it, not regarding how sower heauy punishment hangs over it, and what a foule repr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch it is to both sexes. And so much for the Morall.</p>
            <p>For the Historie of this booke, little is to be said of the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, because the booke digresseth to other<note place="margin">Historie.</note> matters: but whereas mention is made of Calledon forrest in Scotland, and of King <hi>Arthur</hi> his knights, I thought it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, as in the former booke I told you, what I thought of <hi>Merlin</hi> that was <hi>Arthurs</hi> great counseller, so now somewhat to touch, as the space will permit, the reports that are true and probable of king <hi>Arthur.</hi> It is generally written and beleeued that this <hi>Arthur</hi> was a notable valiant and religious Prince, and that he governed this Iland in that rude age with great love of his people, and honour of forraine nations, he instituted an order of the knights of the round table onely (as it seemes) of some meriment of hunting, or some pleasant exercises. He was himself of stature very tall, as appeares by the proportion of him left (as they say here in our countrey of Somerset) in a doore of a Church by the famous Abbey
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7215:26"/>
of Glassenbury, in which Abbey his wife Queene <hi>Gueneuer</hi> was buried, and within our memory taken vp in a coffin, with her body and face in shew plainly to be discerned, saue the very tip of her nose, as diuers dwelling there about haue reported. But what manner of death king <hi>Arthur</hi> himselfe died, it is doubtfull, and that which they report seemes meerly fabulous, namely that he was caried away in a barge from a bridge called Pomperles, neare the said Glassenbury, and so conueyed by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ne persons, (or by the Ladie of the Lake) with promise to bring him backe againe one day! vpon which it seems the foolish people grounded their vaine saying (King <hi>Arthur</hi> comes againe.)</p>
            <p>For my part I confesse my selfe to haue bin more inquisitiue of such trifles then a wiser man would, and viewing that bridge and all that countrey about Glassenbury, I see good reason to guesse, that all that countrie which now we call our moores (and is reduced to profitable and fertill ground) was sometime recouered from the sea, and might be nauigable vp to Glassenbury in those times: and so I suppose the said King being drowned there by some mishap, and being well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of the people, some fained (to content their minds) that he was but gone a little way, and would come again: as the Senate of Rome, hauing killed <hi>Romulus</hi> for his tyrannie, deuised a tale of I know not what <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>M. Camden</hi> the best antiquarie of our time, writeth that king <hi>Arthurs</hi> body was taken vp at the foresaid Glassenbury in the time of king <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, which indeed is most credible, as he there proueth. But this I conclude, that this Prince was so worthy a man in his time, as not onely true histories haue greatly recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the posteritie, but almost all Poeticall writers that haue bin since, haue mentioned this famous Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> of England, as a person of whom no notable exploit was incredible. And thus much for king <hi>Arthur.</hi>

            <p>For the Allegorie of this booke,<note place="margin">Allegorie.</note> much might be said of <hi>Atlant,</hi> of his horse and his shield, but I will onely touch what I thinke will be thought most worth the noting, and let passe the rest for each mans priuat conceit. <hi>Atlant</hi> by many of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures and actions here specified, may signifie Cupid, or that fond fancie that we call loue: and whereas he takes vp such braue captains and souldiers, as well as women and weaklings: it seemes consonant to that pretie fantastik verse of Ouid:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Militat omnis amans &amp; habet sua castra Cupido.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>All louers warriers are, and Cupid hath his campe.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Further, the wings of this strange beast called the Griphith horse, agree with <hi>Petrarks</hi> description of Cupids wings:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Sopra gli homeri hauea sol due grand'ali, di color mille.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Vpon his shoulders were two mightie wings, of thousand colours.</l>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Atlant</hi> takes, and imprisons those he takes. Loue is as close and inextricable a prison as his.</p>
            <p>The wayes to <hi>Atlants</hi> castle are described to be craggie, headlong, and vnpleasant. Such be the wayes of that passion. The castle is said to be placed in the middle of a rockie mountaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This is that wandring wood, of which the dolefull <hi>Petrarke</hi> complaines so often in those his sweete mourning sonets, in which he seemes to haue comprehended all the passions that all men of that humour haue felt. And this he saith of it:

                  <l>Thus I am growne a sauage beast and vyld,</l>
                  <l>That still with wandring steps and solitarie,</l>

            <p>Also whereas it is said what plentie of all pleasures they had in <hi>Atlantas</hi> castle, it signifieth, that delicious fare and such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <l>I will declare it in another booke.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The very beginning of this booke being as it were a morall of it selfe,<note place="margin">Morall.</note> were sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the point it treats of without any more speech to that purpose: but because the matter is such as cannot be too much spoken of, namely to perswade me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in matrimonie, I must needs adde a word or two thereof. And first for mine opinion, I professe that I think it a vertue for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be kind to his wife, &amp; I am of the Censor <hi>Cato</hi> his mind, who being a maruellous ausiere ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwise; yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced flatly that a man could not be an honest man, that was not to his wife a kind man. And I wil go thus much farther, that you shall hardly find a discreet louing husband, I mean (without dissimulation or flattery) but is withal a vertuous good mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be they of what calling they list: wherfore I honor matrimonial loue in my superiors, I loue it in my equals I praise it in my inferiors, I commend it in all, and to all of what sort or sex soeuer, &amp; I wish them but to call to mind his comparison before set down in verse, and to this effect in prose, that if the male &amp; female in beasts and foule, for the most part, liue in concord &amp; agreement, what a foule and worse then beastly thing is it, for man &amp; wife to be euer bralling &amp; snarling, (for as for smiting) I count it more then mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strous: &amp; let al sorts embrace this honest loue, not only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended but commanded by God, in holy Scriptures, where they are called both one flesh, to giue vs thereby to vnderstand, that as we would not willingly breake our owne shins, nor let our finger ake if we could remedie the same, &amp; if we see one strike him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or knocke his head to the wall, we thinke him Bidlem mad. So he that shall willingly grieue the wife of his bosome, or wickedly hurt her, we may thinke him far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a sober, &amp; farther fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an honest man. And euen as if one haue an ach or any grief in his toe or finger, straight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he doth lap that part in warm cloth, &amp; ea
seth it al he can, &amp; cherisheth it more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore til it be sound again: so if any thing either il don, or il take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </gap> perhaps though not il ment, (haue bred a litle powting or lowring toward vnkindnesse, we must lap vp the part thus grieued in warm imbracements, &amp; heale it with sweet words. And if it be but a greene wound, annoint it with the precious balsamu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which all good surgeons know to be a soueraigne medicine for such griefes) and so we shall soundly cure it without any maime or scarre, but we must neuer come to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of cutting or searing, except the disease grow to a <hi>Gangrena</hi> or some cankred malice vnpossible to be cured.</p>
            <p>Another good morall obseruation to be gathered in this ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, is the choise of <hi>Cencuta,</hi> who being a great Lady by birth yet chose rather a gallant faire conditioned gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great Duke. For first it is no disparageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the greatest Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>presse in the world to marie one that is a gentleman by birth, according to the old prouerb, <hi>A gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may make a king and a clarke may proue a Pope.</hi> Secondly, if we marke generally the successe of all mariages, we may find the saying of <hi>Themistocles</hi> true, <hi>Better is a man without mony, then mony without a man.</hi> To many and toto pitifull are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that we haue hard of, I will not say seene, of those Ladies that to match the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues or their daughters on step higher nay but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the higher end of the same step higher the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they might otherwise haue don, haue with that ambition vndon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, making them liue with great discontent, or to say the truth, flat misery, with their proud &amp; vnkind Lord. And yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not such euident &amp; neare examples moue some both fair, &amp; modest, &amp; vertuous, to keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of such gilded gyues. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Be a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (saith he) neuer so diseased, deformed, decrepit, vnwholsome, vnsauorie, yet if he haue bene either so good a storer for mony, that he may leue his wife wealthy; or be so great in titles though a begar in liuing, that she may take her place the higher, they wil (saith he) be contented to lay their so delicate and daintily preserued morsels, in such lothsome dishes to be daily smackt &amp; slauered, binding themselues to suffer such a penance God knowes how long, only to satisfie those humors of coueteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and pride, staruing to their griefe, the third humour (if they be so vertuous) that is by some thought the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant humor in that sex, and many times dwels vnder the same roofe with the other two. Yet surely I could rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his curtesan that he writes of in his <hi>Decameron,</hi> who hauing bargained with a Dutchman, one <hi>M. Bruffaldo,</hi> for seuen dayes boord and lodging at a great rate, hauing found him for one or two nights to be but an vnsauorie bed fellow, she chose rather to leese those two nights hire, then to endure fiue more at so painful a price. But I doubt I grow too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous while I shoot out such blots out of a <hi>Boccas.</hi> Now to go forward in the morall. You may note in <hi>Polynesso</hi> an enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and trecherous mind: in <hi>Ariodant</hi> the hurt of a credulous ielousie: in <hi>Lurcanio</hi> the vehemencie of a wrong surmise.

            <p>In <hi>Ariodants</hi> combat with his brother, we may note how the loue of kinred often giues place to the loue of carnalitie. In <hi>Dalindas</hi> going into religion, after she had her pardon, we may note, that amendment of life is necessary after true repentance. In <hi>Rogeros</hi> travelling three thousand miles, and then resting at <hi>Alcynas,</hi> we may obserue how the thoughts of men ranging abrode into a thousand matters, lastly abide in the pleasantest.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Astolfos</hi> metamorphosis into a myrtle tree (which tree is said to be dedicated to <hi>Venus</hi>) we may note, how men giuen ouer to sensualitie, leese in the end the verie forme of man (whch is reason) and so become beastes or stockes: but these two last notes will be more aptly considered in the Allegorie.</p>

First therefore of <hi>Rogero,</hi> (as we have in part touched before) we may understand the Griffeth horse that carried him, to signifie the passion of the minde contrarie to reason, that caries men in the aire, that is in the height of their imaginations, out of Europe, that is, out of the compasse of the rules of Christian religion and feare of God, vnto the Ile of <hi>Alcyna</hi>; which signifieth pleasure and vanities of this world.</p>
            <p>The example of <hi>Astolfos</hi> mishap, and his good counsell which <hi>Rogero</hi> followed so slenderly, shew how neither the counsels of friends, nor no examples, can for the most part stay a man in his youthfull course, from that which he shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter surely repent. <hi>Rogeros</hi> offring to go to <hi>Logestilla,</hi> which betokens vertue, signifies the good motiues that men haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, by reading good bookes, or hearing good sermons to amend their liues: but then the monstrous crew that stoppeth <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gero,</hi> signifying the base conceits of men, and foule desires that assaile them, as namely those sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>: now whereas it is said in this booke that <hi>Alcynas</hi> man or her faulkner with his horse hauke and dog did impeach <hi>Rogeros</hi> passage, I take it that by these foure are ment the foure passions that most trouble the minde when it begins to encline to vertue, namely by the seruant feare may be vnderstood, which is euer seruile and base, by the hauke couetousnesse that is euer seeking new prey and is neuer satisfied: by the dog griefe and discontentment that is alway byting and enuying and greeuing at others well doing: by the horse is vnderstood inordinatioy, which is in another kinde an enemie to vertue and constancie, for as soone is a temperat and moderate minde discouered in prosperitie as in aduersitie, and (as <hi>Tully</hi> saith) a wise man is neither <hi>Aduersis rebus oppreslus nec elatus secundis</hi>: to which effect I remember a verse of my fathers, written to an Earle many yeares since.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Such one is ware by what degrees he clymes,</l>
               <l>Rather pleasant then proud in high estate,</l>
               <l>Rather bold then abasht in lowring times,</l>
               <l>And can in both so well vphold his state,</l>
               <l>As many would, but few can do or none,</l>
               <l>Of which few sort, I wish your Lordship one.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But to proceed in the Allegorie, these impediments that disturbe men in their good course, are all but like owls or batts driuen away with sunne shine: for the light of vnderstanding and the shining of true worthines, or (as <hi>M. Dyer</hi> in an excellent verse of his termeth it) the light that shines in worthines, dissolueth and disperseth these dustie impediments, that let a man in his iourney to <hi>Logestillas</hi> Court, that is, to the court of vertue, of temperance, of pietie, where all good lessons are taught, as shalbe showed more plaine in that part of this booke, where <hi>Rogero</hi> comes to <hi>Logestilla</hi>

            <p>By <hi>Melyssa</hi> that recouers from <hi>Alcyna Astolfos</hi> armour and the <hi>Lancia d'oro</hi> or Goldelaunce, and likewise restores <hi>Astolfo</hi> to his former state and shape by vertue of the ring, in the absence of <hi>Alcyna,</hi> by her (I say) we may vnderstand some graue and ghostly counseller, that with strong reasons and godly perswasions, hauing driuen away for the time, a mans sinfull thoughts and desires, takes occasion vtterly to extinguish them and deliuer a man from them with the same reasons, and to draw him to vertue and Religion. <hi>Alcynas</hi> forces she prepares by sea and by land, signifie the meanes our ghostly enemies vse to bring vs backe againe to our old vices (like the dog to his vomit) by land she followes him, and after by sea she encounters him, which briefely showes, that the remembrance of passed pleasures make a man often in perill to be drawen backe as it were by land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In <hi>Byreno</hi> that abandoned his kind <hi>Olympia</hi> in a desolate Iland,<note place="margin">Morall.</note> and fell in loue with another, we may note an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ingratitude, the monsirous fault of all faults, and most odious before God and man: and herein learne to abhor and detest this vice in him and in all others, that hauing received preferment or aduancement, either by men or women, when they haue done, shake them off like horses that be lame, or garments that be old, preferring one to the mill, the other to the dunghill: or as our <hi>Stukley</hi> said, make as much of his wife as he could, and if any could make more of her, they might take her, after he had gotten many thousand pounds by making much of her. In the spiteful words that one of <hi>Alcynas</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men spake of <hi>Rogero,</hi> we may obserue the maner of want on worldlings, that if they see a young man live temperatly, or go plainly, or speake deuoutly, straight they say he is a base fellow, and one that knowes not what belongs to a Gentleman: which foolish maner of phrase, by <hi>Rogeros</hi> example we must learne to contemne, and know that such men are indeed base as thinke temperance, and sobrietie, and deuotion base qualities. Finally in <hi>Rogeros</hi> trauell about the world, we may see how commendable it is for a yong gentleman to trauel abrode into forrain nations, but yet we may note withall an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience that comes many times with it, to see some <hi>Angelicas</hi> naked, that will tempt men of very stanch gouernment and staid yeares to that which they shall after repent, as <hi>Rogero</hi> did this his wantonnesse, as appears more plainly in the next booke, where you shall find he lost both his horse and the ring by the vngratefulnesse of <hi>Angelica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the matter historicall of this tenth booke,<note place="margin">Historie.</note> there is litle to be said, and nothing to be affirmed: for the succors sent to France from England, Scotland, Ireland, and many places thereabouts, though I cannot affirme precisely of the time, yet sure it is that many have bin sent hence against the Turk to France and elsewhere. And whereas he speakes of <hi>S. Patrick</hi> the Irish Saint, I would haue them that would know the story of him to look in <hi>Surius de vitis Sanctorum,</hi> and there they may see it at large: for mine owne part, at my being in Ireland, where I taried a few moneths, I was inquisitiue of their opinion of this Saint, and I could learne nothing, other then a reuerent conceit that they had of him, as becomes all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to haue of deuout men, and chiefly of those by whom they are first instructed in the Christian faith: but for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, I found neither any that affirmed it or beleeued it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Logestillas</hi> castle,<note place="margin">Allegorie.</note> the ornaments thereof, the herbs of the garden, all these figure the true magnificence, glory, comfort, and vtilitie of vertue.

And so whatsoeuer else is spoken of <hi>Logestilla</hi> in Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory is taken for vertue.</p>

            <p>In the beginning of this eleuenth booke is a notable morall of temperance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Moral.</hi>
               </note> with two comparisons, one of the horse, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Beare, which I iudge fit for this place rather to be repeated then expounded. If (saith he) a horse, with a little snaffle, may be stopt in his full carrire, what a shame is it for a man not to bridle his disordinate affections with reason, but to be like a Beare so greedie of honie, that he breakes downe the hiues, and deuoureth the combes, till his tongue, eyes and iawes be stong, readie to make him runne mad: so do young men deuoure with extreme greedinesse, these sensuall pleasures, of venerie, surfetting, drinking, pride in apparrell, and all intemperance, till in the end they are plagued with sicknesse, pouertie, and many other inconueniences to their vtter ruine and confusion. Wherefore in the person of <hi>Rogero</hi> young men may weigh the losses he had by following his present fancie to <hi>Angelica</hi>; namely his ring and his horse: by the tone is vnderstood reason, by the other courage. In <hi>Angelica</hi> whose beutie so exceedingly shined in her poore apparel, you great Ladies may see, that your true natural beauties becom you best, beside that it hath euer bene counted a great signe of modestie and chast disposition in women, to be rather cleanly then sumptuous in apparrell, for the vaine expence therin hath bene often occasion both to corrupt the minds and manners of many not ill disposed. And therefore that excellent verse of <hi>Sir Philip Sidney</hi> in his first <hi>Arcadia</hi> (which I know not by what mishap is left out in the printed booke) is in mine opinion worthie to be praised and followed, to make a good and vertuous wife.
<q>
                  <l>Who doth desire that chast his wife should bee,</l>
                  <l>First be he true, for truth doth truth deserue,</l>
                  <l>Then be he such as she his worth may see,</l>
                  <l>And alwayes one credit with her preserue:</l>
                  <l>Not toying kind, nor causlesly vnkind,</l>
                  <l>Not stirring thoughts, nor yet denying right:</l>
                  <l>Not spying faults, not in plaine errors blind,</l>
                  <l>Neuer hard hand, nor euer rayns too light:</l>
                  <l>As far from want, as far from vaine expence,</l>
                  <l>Tone doth enforce, the tother doth entice,</l>
                  <l>Allow good companie, but driue fro thence,</l>
                  <l>All filthie mouths that glorie in their vice.</l>
                  <l>This done, thou hast no more but leaue the rest,</l>
                  <l>To nature, fortune, time, and womans brest.</l>

                  <hi>Historie,</hi>
               </note> as I somewhat touched two bookes before, so here you see how he affirmath in a manner that they were inuented in Germanie. And so I haue read, that the first time they were vsed was in the yeare 1391. in the Venetians war against the Genoas, but it is maruell that the inuentors name of so monstrous a thing is not knowne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baken</hi> the great English necromancer wrote many yeares before that time, that he knew how to make an engin, that with salt peter and brimstone wel tempered together should proue notable for batterie, but he said he would not discouer it, for feare it would be a meane to destroy all mankinde.</p>
            <p>In the destruction of the Ile of <hi>Ebuda,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Allegorie.</hi>
               </note> and all that hath bene sayd of it before, with the monsters that are said to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure women naked and forsaken, this Allegoricall sence is to be picked out (though to some perhaps it will seeme greatly strayned.) By the Iland is signified pride, and loosnesse of life, that they are brought to (by pirats) which signifie flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that go rouing about to tise them hither, robbing them indeed of all their comely garments of modestie, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie, and at last leaue them naked vpon the shore, despised and forsaken, to be deuoured of most vgly and misshapen monsters signified by the Orke, as filthie diseases', deformities, and all kinde of contemptiple things, which monsters, a good plaine friend, with an anker of fidelitte will kill, as <hi>Orlando</hi> did this, and so cloth againe the nakednesse, that before pride and flatterie made vs lay open to the world.</p>
            <p>And whereas is it said that <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Proteus</hi> fled from <hi>Orlando,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Moral</hi>
               </note> that though they make choise of most worthie men (as <hi>Isabella</hi> did) yet if it be without their parents good will, it seldome prospers, but is full of diuers misaduentures and hazards, that many times be the cause of their vtter ruine. In that <hi>Oderike</hi> giueth place to his disordinate lust, forgetting all faith and loyalty, we may note the frailtie of young men, and what vnfit tutors they are for such charges, who when they haue broken all the bands of faith and honestie, they think notwithstading they haue made a sufficient excuse for the matter, if they may lay the fault vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (sauing your reuerence) <hi>Cupid</hi> In <hi>Corebo,</hi> that would not be wonne to consent to his frends desire in so foule a matter, we may take good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of faith and loyaltie, that must neither for frendship nor kindred yeeld to any dishonorable act.

The first he speakes of is the <hi>Duchesse</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> whose husband had a great victorie at Tare a riuer of Italie, against <hi>Charles</hi> the right of France. <hi>Ariosto</hi> therefore compares her chastitie with this victorie, according to that excellent wise saying, it is a greater vertue to conquer ones owne affections then to win cities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beatrice</hi> wife to <hi>Lodwick Sforze</hi> of whom in the three and thirtith booke there is more said, only here he notes (which was true indeed) that during his wiues life he liued more happy then he did after: for at her death began his miserie</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hercules</hi> of Este married <hi>Alfonsos</hi> daughter, of whom he had <hi>Alfonso Hippolito</hi> and <hi>Isabella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Renata, Lewis</hi> the xij. king of France maried the Duchesse of Brittaine, and had by her issue this <hi>Renata,</hi> one of whose ofspring was after matched into the house of Austria, so as that Dukedome is in great danger to be gotten by the Spaniards, now that line of France that came of the elder sister is extinguished. But this is beside the booke, onely I thought good to touch the particular stocke of some of these famous women, that my Author so much extolleth: as I haue my selfe read of some of them in <hi>Guicciardin</hi> and <hi>Frances Vlloa</hi> that wrote the life of <hi>Charles</hi> the fist in Italian: and this I will note withall, that my author doth with great discretion commend three speciall vertues in the women of the house of Este. First deuotion, for he alledgeth that many of them entred into religion, and liued all their time denoutly, which he praiseth chiefly, though in the last place, saying. <hi>I passe all those that passe all these some deall.</hi> Next cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie. <hi>Penelope in spending chast her dayes, as worthie as Vlysses was of praise.</hi> Thirdly education of children, as is likewise touched before in another place.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The vertues that in women merit praise,</l>
               <l>Are sober showes without, chast thoughts within.</l>
               <l>True faith and due obèdience to their make,</l>

               </note> is still ready to hazard his person for more honor, may be obserued, that ambition is as vnsatiable as any other humour of man. In his woing of <hi>Doralice,</hi> we may see how loue makes men many times, not onely valiant, but eloquent. In the assaulting and defending of Paris, is set downe what sundry accidents happen when such populous cities come to so great extremitie. In <hi>Charles</hi> that first makes his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, and after makes all prouident preparation for defence of the towne, we see a liuely patterne of an excellent and worthy Prince, both for deuotion and policie.</p>
            <p>Concerning the historie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Historie.</hi>
               </note> I haue quoted many things in the margent, as the straightnesse of roome would permit, that the simplest reader may vnderstand what is meant by the fourth staffe: here onely I will ad a word of Rauenna, referring the reader that is desirous to be better informed hereof, to <hi>Guicciardin,</hi> who sets it downe at large. Rauenna was besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the French vnder the conduct of one <hi>Fois,</hi> a notable captaine of so young a man. The Spaniards and Pope <hi>Iulio</hi> tooke vpon them to defend it, but in the heat of that assault <hi>Fois</hi> was slaine: yet the souldiers either by force or by parlee gat into the towne, and being within, they committed the notablest outrages that haue bene heard of, neither abstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from rapes nor sacriledge. Concerning the Catalyns, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he nameth formost in the musters, they are the chiefe house in all Spaine: and it is to be noted, that Spaine is deuided into fiue kingdomes, Nauar, Castill, Catalogna (which is now called Aragon) Portugall, and Granata. For Gallicia is counted none, because it had a king but a while. The rest of the strange names you may find in the table.</p>
            <p>In the description of Discord and Fraud,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Allegorie.</hi>
               </note> and finding Silence in the house of sleep, being long since banished from philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers and diuines; the allegorie is so plain, as it were time lost to spend time to expound it, because it expounds it selfe so plainly: only I will obserue one thing, in which mine Author is thought to keep an excellent decorum. For, making Discord and Fraud of the feminine gender, he still makes Silence the masculine; as the like pretie conceit is in our Cambridge Comedie <hi>Pedantius,</hi> (at which I remember the noble Earle of Essex that now is, was present) where the <hi>Pedantius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, examining the Gramaticall instruction of this verse: <hi>Caedant arma togae, concedat laurea linguae,</hi> vpon speciall consideration of the two last words, taught his scholler <hi>Parillus,</hi> that <hi>laurea, lingua sunt vtraque foemininae generis, sed lingua potissimum,</hi> and so consequently silence might not by any meanes haue bene of the feminine gender.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Mandricardos</hi> rape of <hi>Doralice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Allusion.</hi>
               </note> he alludes euidently to a notable villany in the like kind, done by <hi>Caesar Borgia</hi> son to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt. For one <hi>Caraccio</hi> a captaine of Venice, hauing bene lately contracted to a gentlewoman of good account, she came with an honorable train neare to a citie called Cesenna in Romagna: here <hi>Borgia</hi> with a band of men, set vpon her company, and took her away by force, and neither by threats nor intreatie of the Venecian Ambassador would restore her again: the allusion holds in many parts, as first where he saith in the 29. staff. That <hi>Marsilio</hi> had giuen <hi>Mandricardo</hi> an horse.
<q>
                  <l>Of colour bay, but blacke the taile and maine,</l>

                  <l>The sier was a villan braue of Spaine.</l>
               </q> This notes <hi>Borgia,</hi> whose father was a Spaniard, his mother a Flemming, and he a mungrel bastard. In the one an thirtith staffe, in the simile of the Wolfe, he noteth his crueltie: in the eight and fortith staffe where he saith,
<q>
                  <l>If state may stand insteed, who can denie,</l>

                  </l>

            <p>In the beginning of this booke was an excellent morall (if you obserued it) shewing how hurtfull it is for a captain to be prodigall of his men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Moral.</hi>
               </note> and rash or headlong in his attempts: the former of which faults (that worthy and valiant gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) sir <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> hath very grauely and iustly reproued in some captains of our time, in that treatise that he wrote in defence of the vse of long bowes: and indeed it cannot be denied but bloudy conquests are no praise to the conquerour: In token whereof the Lacedemonians appointed, that he that wan a bloody victory should sacrifice a cocke; but he that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame by policie without bloudshed, an oxe: so much they preferred wisedome that is peculiar to man, before strength that is common to beasts. In <hi>Charles</hi> is to be noted the prouidence of a wise and valiant Prince: In <hi>Astolfo,</hi> that by the power of his horne rids the country of theeues and malefactors, we may learne to apply the talents are giuen vs, to good vses: In <hi>Griffin,</hi> that after all his deuotion at Ierusalem, comes againe to <hi>Origilla,</hi> we may note the frailtie of flesh, and withall, that outward holinesse without inward zeale auaileth nothing.</p>

And for the Indian voyages, we need not so much admire the captains of forren nations, hauing two of our owne nation that haue both as forwardly aduentured, and as fortunatly performed them, namely, sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> whom I touched before, and yong Master <hi>Candish.</hi>

               </note> by the booke is signified wisedome, whereby all charmes and toyes are discouered: and by the horne is vnderstood iustice, that indeed brings terror to all misdoers, and driues them out of the country.

Also whereas <hi>Astolfo</hi> looks first in his booke ere he take vpon him the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise to fight with <hi>Orillus,</hi> it is to be vnderstood, that good aduice is to be taken before men vndertake dangerous exploits.</p>

The fatall haire of <hi>Orillus,</hi> though it be meerly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous, yet hath it allusion to some truth: for besides that, diuers Poets haue written of some, whose life lay in their haire, as <hi>Nysus</hi> killed by his daughter, and <hi>Alcest</hi> that could not die til <hi>Mercury</hi> cut off one haire: and of <hi>Dido</hi> likewise is said that <hi>Iris</hi> was sent to cut her haire to rid her out of her paine: besides these (I say) the Scripture testifies of the vertue of <hi>Samsons</hi> strength to haue bin in his haire, which is as strange for reason as any of the rest.</p>

               </gap>plameth of the misery of Italie, oppressed by tyrants, so contrariwise I might take occasion to magnifie the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of our realme of England for the gracious and mild gouernement of our Soueraigne, saue that so high and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull a matter, requires an entire treatise, and not so broken a discourse as I vse in these briefe notes, and therefore Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it wholy for another worke of mine owne, if God giue me abilitie to performe it: but now to the matter of this booke.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7215:78"/>
In that <hi>Rodomont</hi> kils and massacres the people, without resistance, or without any man to make head against him, we may marke how fitly and properly the multitude may be likened to sheepe, not onely in that they be shorne, and flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed euery yeare for their wooll, and sometime pinched to the quicke by the greedie shearers, but also that when they should come to defend themselues, their houses, and children, from inuading of the enemie, they runne away like sheepe, from the noise of the barking of a little curre, vntill their shepheard come and defend them.</p>
            <p>In the tale of <hi>Norandine,</hi> that for his faire <hi>Lucinas</hi> sake did hazard his life so manifestly, and after was contented to Lap himselfe vp in a goates skin, and to noynt himselfe ouer with goates suet, we may note how hartie loue and affection, will make a man disdaine nothing, be it neuer so base. In <hi>Martanos</hi> cowardise, and craftie vndermining of <hi>Griffino,</hi> we may marke how cowardly fellowes be commonly trecherous, and priuie vnderminers. And in that <hi>Norandine</hi> (a good natured and affable Prince) did condemne <hi>Griffino</hi> to prison, without once calling him to answer for himselfe, we may take an excellent good note (as my authour hath done vpon this matter in the next booke) how hurtfull a thing it is in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth when a magistrate (and specially a Prince) shal heare such a Martanist as <hi>Martano,</hi> or such a Gil as <hi>Origilla</hi> was, whisper them in their eares, &amp; giue malicious and vntrue (though probable) informations against well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing men: And sure, though some hold opinion that these kinde of people (called informers) be to be cherished, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie seruants of the state, though defamed otherwise, and euen confessing themselues, that it is no honest mans office; yet for my part, I haue heard wise men say, that such men are hurt full to the state in pollicie, and make more malcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, then they discouer; and I am sure it is far from the rules of Christen charitie, and to be controld euen by heathenish ciuillitie. <hi>Tully</hi> speaking of the like men saith, <hi>Anseribus cibaria publicè locantur &amp; canes aluntur in Capitolio.</hi> Likening them, to be as necessarie to keepe in the common wealth, as geese and doggs in the Capitoll: yet as <hi>Tully</hi> there noted, if the doggs barkt without cause, at such as came of deuotion to worship the Gods, then their legs ought to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: And euen so these doggs, these bloodhounds, nay bloodyhounds, that bite in their barking, if they shall at any time snap at such as come to honor and serue their Prince, it were pittie their leggs should be broken; for though they fal lame, yet they can be carried in coaches and horslitters; marrie if their neckes were broken, the Realme should (I thinke) haue a fair riddance of them. But I wil end this note with a verse of that pleasant Poet <hi>Martiall,</hi> written aboue 1500 yeares since to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who had then banished promooters out of Rome: the which verse (I confesse) concurs with my opinion.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Turba grauis paci, placidae\'que inimica quieti,</l>
               <l>Quae semper miseras sollicitabat opes,</l>

               <l>Impensis vitam, Caesaris annumeres.</l>

            <q>
               <l>The vile Promooters, foes to peace and enemies to rest,</l>
               <l>That with false tales, do neuer cease, mens goods from them to wrest,</l>
               <l>Are banisht hence full many a mile, to barren place and wast,</l>
               <l>And he that others did exile, that selfe same cup doth tast;</l>

               <l>But Caesar was at too much cost, to let them scape aliue.</l>

            <p>And thus much for the morall.</p>

(<hi>Tempora tempora quod monstrum aluistis?)</hi> Oh times what a monster haue yee bred? how far is this doctrine from his, that taught to forgiue, not seuen times, but seauentie times seuen times?</p>
            <p>Lastly in <hi>Medoro,</hi> we may note a notable example of gratitude towards his masters dead corse, in hazarding his own life to burie it; which is indeed (though he were a heathen) a most Christian act, and one of the works of charitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Scripture, as namely in <hi>Tobia</hi>; who was greatly rewarded and blessed for it: And further we may note in all ages, buriall hath bene thought a most necessarie thing, and religious: but of <hi>Medoros</hi> gratitude I shall speake more in the next booke.</p>

That wise and honorable counseller <hi>Sir Walter Mildmay,</hi> as in all other things he shewed himselfe an vncorrupt man to his end, so his writings and sayings were euer spiced with this reuerent feare of God: for <hi>ex abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantia cordis os loquitur</hi>: and among other of his (worth the noting) of which he himselfe gaue me a little volume when I was a boy of Eaton college (the which since his death haue bene published in print) but one speciall verse he had to that effect in Latin, and was by me put into English at the request of that honorable Gentleman his sonne in law, <hi>Master William Fitzwilliams.</hi>

In <hi>Zerbinos</hi> happie deliuerance, from a shameful death, by <hi>Orlandos</hi> meanes, we may obserue that which can neuer be too much obserued, namely how diuine prouidence neuer failes the innocent.

               </note>my author hath (in mine opinion) shewd himselfe his crafts master, setting it out, verie pathetically, or (to speake English) passionatly. Furder there is in it a notable <hi>Peripetia,</hi> which signifies the agnition, or taking knowledge of a sudden mutation of fortune, either good or bad to a contrarie extreame: of which kind there be many examples, but specially one, to which mine author seemes to allude. Namely that of <hi>Oedipus</hi> in <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi> for when a messenger came to him, to tell him how by the death of <hi>Polybus</hi> he was elected king of Corinth, <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> refused to come thither, for feare of committing incest with his owne mother (of which the Oracle had foretold him) the messenger thinking to cleare him of that scruple; vnaduisedly told him whose sonne he was (which he knew not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) and thereby now knew certainly that, which before he mistrusted, namely that he had laine with his mother, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in deed he fell starke mad, and was after recured as appeares in the storie.</p>

               </note> in <hi>Rogeros</hi> valiant proceeding for the deliuerie of <hi>Richardetto</hi> (though as then not knowne to him what he was) may be noted a wonderfull courage and promptnes to honorable exploits: In the great likenes of face of <hi>Bradamant</hi> and <hi>Richardetto</hi> (though this be but a fiction) yet we may obserue the rare, and (as it were) cunning workmanship of nature; admirable, as well in making so many sundrie countenances, one vnlike another: as also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in making some so exceeding like, which indeed though it seldomer fortunes, and sooner alters in brother and sister; yet in two brothers, it is seene many times, and therefore not improbable to be written, as it is here for the forenamed couple. I have heard in England of the two <hi>Tremaines</hi> not many yeares past: I haue knowne myselfe two of the <hi>Wrothes</hi> in Eaton schoole, and lately in her Maiesties court two <hi>Tracies,</hi> two proper and valiant young Gentlemen; whom my selfe being familiarly acquainted with, yet I could verie hardly know one from the other. But to come to the tale of <hi>Richardetto</hi> and <hi>Fiordispina,</hi> (which name signifieth as much as the flowre of thorne, and not vnapt for her prickling condition) I must confesse my author sheweth in the tale, rather pleasant wit, then any sober grauitie, and the best I can say is this, that it is a bad matter not verie ill handled. But as I vndertooke in the beginning to make speciall note of all she good matters by which the honest reader might take profite, so I thinke it as conuenient, where any light and lasciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter fals (as this is surely one) to temper it in such sort, or at least to salue it so, as it may do least hurt. Namely, I would not haue that xxv. staffe by misapplying it, made worse: being perhaps bad enough at the best.

This taken, as many will take it, may seeme but lewd doctrine, but thus it ought and may be honestly taken, that he that in good honorable sort (as put the case in the way of marriage) may obtaine the loue of some worthy Ladie, and stands in her high sauour, and then will be so bashfull, either for want of wit or heart, to leese that oportunitie, he may be in good reason indued with those gentle titles; neuerthelesse to vnderstand it generally were vngoodly, considering the Scripture commendeth to vs the example of Ioseph, that refused his mistres kindnes. But to conclude the morall of this tale, we may note how full of doubts and feares these vnlawfull pleasures are, how soeuer some men like better, to hunt by stealth in another mans walke, then to haue the fairest course that may be at game of their owne.</p>

               </gap>urder, in <hi>Iocundos</hi> wife, that after all the great protestations of kindnesse, was taken in bed with his man, we may note the fraud as well as frailtie, of some of that sexe.

            <p>In the Queene of Lombardie, that bestowed her loue so basely, we may see that no state nor degree is priuiledged from shame and slander, except vertue and grace from aboue, do keepe them from such enormous offences. Further we may see it is a verie desper at enterprise, to thinke by any restraint, to keepe an vnchast woman from putting in practise her lewd desires. Lastly the defence of women, by the graue wise man, too truly proueth, that though many women are bad, yet many men are worse, and therfore if euery one would mend one (as the Prouerbe saith) al shal be mended. And as for <hi>Rodomonts</hi> new loue, it shews that no passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grows so strong by accident, to remoue &amp; take away a natural disposition.</p>

As I haue heard of one of honest calling <hi>(But namelesse he, for blamelesse he must be)</hi> that finding one in bed with his wife, and seeing euidently, that she had plaid false at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and borne a man to many, drew out his dagger resolutely, and sware a great oth, that if he had not bin his verie frend, he would at least haue killed him: and when he had done he put vp his dagger againe, and went about some other business. Another, hearing one was newly gone out of his house, that had done that for him, which no bodie desires to do by a deputie, tooke his sword and his buckler and followed in a great rage, and hauing ouertaken him, laid adultery to his charge: the man so hotly pursude, and so hardly charged, confessed it was true: with which the tother (being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied, as it seemed with his honest confession) left him, swearing if he had denied it, he would not so haue put it vp.</p>

            <p>And so may I as truly sweare these are mine for they were giuen me by my brother (<hi>Francis Harington</hi>) who made them for a proofe of his veine in this kind; and if his sloth had not bin as blame-worthy, as his skill is praise-worthy, he had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me of much of the paine that I tooke with the rest: and me thinks when I reade his and mine owne together, the phrase agrees so well, as it were two brothers. Though he (in his modestie) would needs giue his elder brother leaue to take all the paines, and praise (if there were any,) following herein the example of diuers, indeed studious and learned Gentlemen, that haue either disdained to bestow so much paines on another mans worke, or at least would not leese so much time from more graue or more profitable studies; or (which perhaps is the chiefest reason) because they feele, that though it is but a sport to write now and then a little odde sonet, yet it is some labour to write a long and setled stile: as <hi>Tullie</hi> saith of writing in prose; <hi>Stilus est optimus dicendi magister, sed laboris magni est, quem plerique fugimus.</hi> Writing is the best schoolmaster for eloquence, but (saith he) it is a painfull thing, and that most of vs cannot away withall. And yet I find (hauing written in both kinds now and then, as my slender capacitie would serue me) that prose is like a faire greene way, wherein a man may trauel a great iourney and not be weary; but verse us a miry lane, in which a mans horse puls out one leg after another with much ado, and often driues his master to light to help him out: but I shall trauell anon so far in this greene way, that I shal be out of my right way, or at least beside my matter; and therfore I now come to the moral.</p>

               <note place="margin">Morall.</note>In the Morall of this xxxij. booke, in the person of <hi>Agramant</hi> we may note, how a Generall must not vpon one foyle or one ill day (as they call it) despaire of his affaires, or abandon his enterprise, but betake him to some strong place of aduantage, till they may make head againe. In which kind, the old Romanes (conquerors of the world) aboue all other things showed their vnconquered minds; and specially then, when <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> had receaued that great foile and ouerthrow by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as <hi>Liuie</hi> noteth in the end of the xxij. booke. <hi>Quo in tempore ipso, adeò magno animo ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas fuit, vt Consuli ex tanta clade (cuius ipse magna causa fuisset) redeunti, &amp; obuiam itum frequenter ab omnibus ordinibus sit, &amp; gratiae actae, quòd de republica non desperasset. Cui si Carthaginiensium ductor fuisset, nihil recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandum supplicij foret.</hi> What time (saith <hi>Liuie</hi>) the citie was of so great courage, that the Consull returning from so mightie an ouerthrow (of which himselfe had bin a great occasion) yet was publikly and solemnly met by all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and had speciall thanks giuen him because he despaired not of the common state: who had he bin captain of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians, no punishment had bin too much for him. Further, in <hi>Brunello</hi> that had somtimes bin <hi>Agramants</hi> secretary, and yet now was hanged for iustice sake, we may note, that wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thought they be somtime aduanced by their Princes to great honors and wealth, yet when their oppressions and thefts shal be plainly boulted out and manifestly proued, law will haue his course, and iustice must be done. And yet wee see also in this booke, in <hi>Bradamants</hi> defence of <hi>Vllany</hi> against the law of sir <hi>Tristrams</hi> lodge, that for the most part lawes are but like Spiders webs, taking the small Gnats, or perhaps sometime the fat flesh flies, but Hornets that haue sharpe stings and greater strength, breake through them.</p>

               <note place="margin">Historie.</note>Of <hi>Iosuas</hi> day, which he toucheth in the xi. staffe, the holy Scripture speakes of, how he made the Sunne stand still. But for the false <hi>Amphittios</hi> night, though it seeme meere fabulous as it is told, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> made the night three nights long, to take the more pleasure of <hi>Alcmene,</hi> yet me thinke it is worth the obseruation, how the very prophane and vaine writings of old times do concurre with the sacred Scriptures; for whensoeuer the birth of <hi>Hercules</hi> was, which I dare not affirme to haue bin at that time, and yet by computation il wil not fall long after. For <hi>Hercules</hi> was a great while before the last Troian warres, and many old writers agree, that <hi>Priamus</hi> liued in <hi>Dauids</hi> time, and sent to him for succor: but howsoeuer that may be proued for the certaine time of his birth, certain it is, when the Sunne stood still in one part of the world, then in reason at their Antipodes and in the other Hemispheare it must needs be night all that while. And if the Sunne were almost downe when <hi>Iosua</hi> spake (as it may be coniectured) because he would not feare want of light to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue his enemies vntill the Sunne were neare setting, then it might be euen in the same Hemispheare within a few degrees. As for example, it is night one hundred miles Eastward sooner then it is so farre Westward by a good while: (as they that are Astronomers can easily resolue the simplest that is.) But to be short, it is verified by many writers, that there was one night obserued to be longer then her fellowes, which night either <hi>Hercules</hi> was borne vpon, or else was fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be begotten vpon, and therefore they sirnamed him <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> but the special drift that mine author hath in this book, is to note how those kings of France that haue come to inuade Italy, and to make a conquest thereof, or of any part thereof, haue had euer ill successe, and bin either taken or foyled: and of the other side, those that haue come to rescue them, and take their parts, haue many times brought backe honour and victory. Now first mine author for the finer bringing in of the matter fathers it vpon <hi>Merlin</hi> our English prophet (as they terme him) of whom I haue spoken before in the notes of the third booke, alledging that he by Magicke framed that sumptuous hall, and therein painted vpon the skreen thereof all these stories of the time to come.</p>
            <p>First he recites all the excellent drawers of the time past, taking by that, occasion to praise the excellent workmanship of some of his owne time: their names he reciteth hudling together; but here I will particularly touch them for their sakes that haue not read of them, and are desirous to know of whence they are.</p>

               <hi>Michael Agnolo</hi> (we pronounce it <hi>Michel Angelo</hi>) was the rare man of this age for drawing and caruing both, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the excellency of the art very yong, and doing many notable works: but three be most famous, one was caruing of an Image of Pitie in Rome, another was a Giant in Florence, the third was a picture of certain naked men that went to wash themselues in Arno, and hearing of a sudden alarme in the camp, they made hast to put on their clothes: in which picture were contained all the gestures, lookes and motions that men could imagine would happen in such an accident: his father sirnamed him <hi>Angelo</hi> in his cradle, as a presage of some great excellencie aboue ordinary that he should grow to. <hi>Raphael</hi> and <hi>Sebastian</hi> were but his schollers, though both very perfect: all which I haue the more willingly noted, and at more length then I was wont in the former bookes in like matters so lightly touched, both because my selfe (I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) take great pleasure in such workes (as pleasing ornaments of a house, and good remembrances of our friends) as also to shew in what great reckning that science hath bin with Emperors and great Princes, and with Prelats and religious persons: howsoeuer some austere or rather vnciuil persons, will seeme either to condemne it or contemne it. And though indeed this Realme hath not bred any <hi>Michel Angelos,</hi> nor men of such rare perfection as may deserue his title:

                     <hi>Michel</hi> (more then a man) Angell diuine.</l>
               </q>
Yet I may say thus much without partialitie, for the honor of my country, as mine author hath done for the honour of his, that we haue with vs at this day one that for limming (which I take to be the very perfection of that art) is comparable with any of any other countrey.<note place="margin">

               </note> And for the praise that I told you of <hi>Parrhasius</hi> for taking the true lines of the face, I thinke our countryman (I meane <hi>M.

But now to the French storie.</p>

               <hi>Lodwike Sforse</hi> spoken of in the 28. staffe, for emulation of the king of Naples, first brought <hi>Charles</hi> the eight into I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, and made him so strong, that in the end he was not able to get him out againe. This <hi>Lodwike</hi> his manner was still to be plotting of new deuices, to set other Princes at variance: now taking part with one side openly, and feeding the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with money secretly; neuer fast friend to any, neuer so proud as when with his smooth tongue and faire promises he had beguiled some plaine and open man, not so fine headed as himselfe. Now though we might perhaps note some men of our time held for notable wise men, and leaning much to this kind of course, yet I see small incouragement, either by his beginning, or proceeding, or ending, why any should thinke him worth the following: he began an vsurper, he liued a dissembler, he died a begger, and (which is worse) a prisoner. Further it is noted in <hi>Guichiardine</hi> that he spent (as I remember) eight hundred thousand Duckets in that kind I spake of, setting Princes together by the eares: and he gat this for his labour, that no Prince loued him, as appeared when being ten yeares a prisoner in France, no man euer made sute in a manner for his libertie. Wherefore <hi>Tully</hi> saith to <hi>Anthonie</hi> in one of his Phillippiks, <hi>Te miror Antone, quorum acta imiteris corum exitus non perhorrescere.</hi> I maruell (saith he) friend <hi>Anthonie,</hi> that you are not afraid of their ends,<note place="margin">

at the assault of Castellnouo in Naples, being impatient of all stay, bargained with an Ethiopian slaue to burne the French nauie, and to let him in at the Church called Santa Croce, but the slaue hauing greater rewards giuen him of the Frenchmen, betrayed him, and shot him in with a forked arrow, and so killed him.</p>

But in the end (as commonly in songs of so many parts they cannot long keepe perfect harmony, but that some song out of tune) so it fell out, that in parting the spoiles, they of the league could not well agree among themselues, and so gaue breath to the Venetians, who thereby recouered much of their state againe.</p>

               </note> he mentions the battell of Pauia, where the king of France was taken, a thing so generally known as I need not stand long on it: onely mine author touches one chiefe ouersight of this kings, which was, that his muster masters deceiued him in the number of his men: but howsoeuer it was, sure it is this Prince was a most worthy man, and wanted no quality of an excellent king, valiant and bountifull and such a fauourer of learned men, that the Italians termed him, <hi>Padre e madre,</hi> the father and mother of learning and liberall sciences.</p>

The punishment of blindnesse laid vpon him for that his presumptuous assaulting Paradice, shewes that no men are in deed more blind, then those that thinke they see so much more then other men, specially when they enter into that wilfull blindnesse, of not seeing the way to their owne saluation. Italie had bin noted long to haue had many irreligious men in it, and no maruel, for our old En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish prouerbe is, the nearer the Church, the furder from God: yet surely those despisers of religion, are themselues dispised of many: in so much as it is growne
for a by word among them; when they speake of such a man, they will say, Oh, he is grown a profound wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he begins now not to beleeue in Christ, therby Ironically noting his passing folly. I would stand longer in applying al the particulars of this Allegorie, but that I doubt I am somewhat to tedious in these notes already.</p>

               </note> booke, is to be noted in the tale of <hi>Lydia,</hi> the punishment of ingratitude, and what an odious sin the same is, in the sight of God and the world: also here are to be obserued many kinds of ingratitudes: as first of her despising of <hi>Alcestes</hi> long seruice, and approued good will, and secondly of the fathers ingrate recompences, for his great deserts by seruices in the wars, in which kind, it is not onely slanderous, but dangerous for a Prince to show a niggardly mind, and much more a contemptuous disposition. For though indeed no subiect (rightly considering his duety) ought to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by any ingratitude or iniury of his seueraigne, to forget his allegeance, yet seeing the nature of most men, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of braue and resolute minded men, is subiect to the passion of reuenge, and can hardly bridle the same when they shall find themselues (as they thinke) disdained, or their seruices not well regarded: therefore the wisest and safest way, and sittest for the Maiestie of a Prince, is to be liberall in rewarding, or at least thankfull in accepting such mens ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, and to consider that loue and bountie, are stronger bands of allegeance, then feare and dutie.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Historie of this booke,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Historie.</hi>
               </note> I have quoted some briefly by the side, and some is so plaine it expounds it selfe: onely I meane to ad a word or two what at I have read, concerning that which is here deliuered by mine author, about the Assumption of <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> First, how far the Scripture toucheth the same in the Gospell, euerie one knoweth, and how vpon the speech of our Sauiour (if I will be tary till I come, what is that to thee) it was noysed among the Disciples, that that Disciple should neuer see death. After this, as other of good credit haue deliuered, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> liued till he was an hundred yeare old, and then made himselfe a tombe, and entred thereinto aliue in presense of many, and on the sodaine, a light shone all about the place, and tooke the tombe for the time, quite from their sights: but the light being gone, the coffin was found empty, and the body of that Saint was no more seene vpon the earth. Whereupon it was certainly thoughtthat he was taken vp into heauen or Paradise, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were. Though this of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> be not recorded in the Scripture (nor no more is the assumption of the blessed virgin) and consequently, no man is bound to beleeue it, as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Creed: Yet for mine owne opinion, I thinke it may be verie true, and I would in such cases beleeue a great deale more then I need, rather then anything lesse them I ought; for the tone (if it be a sinne) is surely pardonable, but the other doubtles is verye damnable. But I will briefly note the Allegorie that is meant hereby.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Allegorie.</hi>
               </note> whereas <hi>Astolfo</hi> washeth himselfe in a christ all well of cleare water, before he can fly vp to Paradise, it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that after a man shall by remorse, and deuout consideration, weigh and behold the filthinesse of his sinne, he must then wash himselfe with the cleare spring water of prayer and repentance; and then and not before, be may mount to Paradise: which may here be vnderstood the comfortable peace of conscience, the onely true Paradise of this world. And whereas <hi>Astolfo</hi> commeth to <hi>S. Iohn</hi> (whose name signifieth grace) to receiue by his helpe <hi>Orlandos</hi> lost witts, for so it is set downe that that was the secret cause why he was guided thither, though vnawares to himselfe: thereby it is to be vnderstood, that no hope nor means is left for any man that hath lost his wit, with following the vanities and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of this world (as diners carelesse christians do, in forgetting and omitting their duties to God, which is the verie highest point of follie,) I say there is no meane for them to recouer their wit againe, but onely by the helpe of this <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> that is this, grace of God, which can miraculously restore it againe.</p>
            <p>In the description of <hi>S. Iohns</hi> apparell (<hi>His gowne was white, but yet his Iacket red, The tone was snow, the tother lookr as blood, &amp;c</hi>) by the red is signified charitie, which burneth with Zeale and seruentinesse of loue; by the white is meant virginitie and purenesse of life.</p>
            <p>All those things that he saines to have beene showed <hi>Astolfo</hi> in the circle of the Moone, are but similitudes, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of such follies, as he that will marke them well, shall easily discerne.</p>
            <p>The old man that ran away so fast with the Printed names of men, and flang them in the darke streame, figureth time, as in the next booke mine author verie artificially explanet bit: affirming in the person of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> as if it were (as our prouerbe faith) as true as the Gospell, that the onely defence against the malice of time, is the pen of the learned: and that same out lasteth, and out styeth all things: as the well learned Gentleman, and my very good frend <hi>M. Henrie Constable</hi> wrate in his Sonnet to the now king of Scotland.

                  <hi>Morall.</hi>
               </note> after the excessiue prayses of <hi>Hippolito,</hi> he returnes to the former matter of the force of time, the Allegorie whereof I will continue in this place: onely for the Morall, I will touch two speciall faults, which mine authour reproues in men of the better sort, one is the great account they make of Parasites, Promoters, and Iesters, and such like; for their basenes and filthines, likened to the asse anporke: and other is their venerie and drunkenes, which he noteth by these words, <hi>anzi venere e bacco</hi>: I Englsh it, <hi>by their owne surffeting and lust</hi>; because surfeting contains both kinds of excesse in meat and drinke. And surely I must grant, that our Realme of England hath bin noted sorriot in meats, many yeares since, and not without cause (though not alone) for <hi>Plato</hi> found the like fault with Italie in his time. but for this other vice of drinking, which, with the name of a health,
ouerthrowes all health and sobrietie, it is nor growne as vsuall and more dious then the tother, and I doubt it will not so easily be driuen out, as it is sodainly crept in. I haue beard a prettie tale not impertinent to this matter, of a Gentleman that had his sonne at the Vniuersitie, who being be like of so good a conscience (as most of vs are in that kind) to take but a little for his money, and growing (as it seemed) more in yeares, then either in learning, or good manners: his tutor to discharge his dutie, sent his father word, how he misdoubted the young mans well doing, because he found him giuen to dycing and gaming: the father was sorry, but yet answered, that he hoped when his sonne grew to haue more wit, he would leaue that, or at least not lose by it. The next news he heard of his amendment, was that now he began to follow women: this touched the father somwhat nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, yet he replied againe, that he made no question but he would leaue that ere long for his owne ease, and therefore yet he
would not dispaire of him. The last newes he heard, was that he began to mend his former two faults; but that now he fell to bilbing and drinking. Out vpon the villan (said the father) I will surely disinherit him: for that fault the elder he waxeth, the more he wilbe subiect to it. Wherefore I conclude this Morall with this exhortation: that if wit cannot make men leaue play, nor their owne ease make thee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eschew venerie; at least let the vglynes, openesse, and beastlines of this sin make them leaue it; which hath no defence, nor no praise: I say praise, because the Scripture saith, <hi>The wicked man i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> praised in his wickednes</hi> But I neuer heard praise ascribed to a drinker, but the well bearing of drinke; which might be a good praise for a brewers horse, or perhaps a brewers man, but sure it is a small bost for a Gentleman.

            <p>True it is that one <hi>Dion</hi> an Historiographer, writeth to that effect, and inforceth verie far to proue, that the Greeks had the worse end of the staffe, and onely that <hi>Homer</hi> fauoring the Greeks, wrate the contrary. Further some haue carped at <hi>Penelopes</hi> chastitie (for what may not a mallicious with carpe at?) and they say <hi>Homer</hi> himselfe insinuateth somewhat of her lightnesse; where he saith in his <hi>Odisseas,</hi> that she obiected vnto her suters that none of them could shoot so strong a shoot as her husband: but howsoeuer it is, for my part, seeing it hath beene receiued so long for a truth, that <hi>Penelope</hi> was a chast and vertuous wife, I will not take vpon me (by <hi>S.

                  <hi>Morall.</hi>
               </note> the most vnnoble thing that can be vsed in peace or warre: for though warre of it selfe is and must needs be bloudy in the heate thereof, yet hath it euer bene detested and contrary to all warlike discipline, to kill those that haue no weapon in hand. Wherefore noble Princes will euer make faire warres, as <hi>Pirthus</hi> said in <hi>Ennius</hi>:
<q>
                  <l>Quorum virtuti belli fortuna pepercit:</l>
                  <l>Horundem me libertati parcere certum est.</l>

               </q>

            <p>Crueltie euer proceeds from a vile mind, and often from a cowardly heart, that haue nothing in their minds nor mouthes but <hi>Mortui non mordent,</hi> which beside it is vnchristen, is also false: for the Scripture saith, <hi>The blood of</hi> Abel <hi>cried for vengeance</hi>; and it is a better approued prouerbe in England, blood will haue blood.</p>

               <hi>Arpalice</hi> or <hi>Harpalice</hi> a woman of Thrace, whose father being taken prisoner by the Geties, a nation of Scythia, with great courage and expedition recovered him from their hands, of whom <hi>Virgil</hi> speakes in his <hi>Aeneads</hi>:

               <hi>Tomeris</hi> Queene of the Massagetians. <hi>Cyrus</hi> became a suter to her, to marry her but she thinking (as it was most likely) he wooed not her, but her kingdome, refused him: hereupon <hi>Cyrus</hi> made warre on her. <hi>Tomeris</hi> sent her son against him, who was taken by <hi>Cyrus</hi> with an ambushment, and slaine. But she faining as though she fled for feare, drew <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the straits of the hils, where (they write) she slue his whole army, being two hundred thousand men, and left not a man aliue to carry newes; and after in reuenge of her son, she put <hi>Cyrus</hi> head into a great boule of bloud, vsing that wel knowne speech: <hi>Satia te sanguine quisanguinem</hi> sitijsti, Fill thy selfe with bloud that didst thirst for bloud.

            <p>This place M. <hi>Alexander Neuell</hi> imitated, in his verses vpon Sir <hi>Philip Sidneys</hi> funerals, with farre sharper conceit then mine author here vseth it. For whereas the now King of Scotland had written among, that pretie Epitaph of the foresand Knight:
<q>
                  <l>Vidit vt extinctum nuper <hi>Citherea Philippum,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Fleuit, &amp; hunc <hi>Martem</hi> credidit esse suum,</l>
                  <l>Abripuit digitis gemmas, collóque monile,</l>
                  <l>Martriterum nunquam seu placitura foret:</l>
                  <l>Mortuus humana qui lusit imagine diuam,</l>
                  <l>Quid faceret iam sivideret ille rogo?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <pb n="315" facs="tcp:7215:167"/>
            <p>To this effect in English,
<q>
                  <l>When <hi>Venus</hi> saw the noble <hi>Sidney</hi> dying,</l>
                  <l>She thought, it her beloued <hi>Mars</hi> had beene:</l>
                  <l>And with the thought thereof she fell a crying,</l>
                  <l>And cast away her rings and carknet cleene,</l>
                  <l>He that in death a goddesse mockt and grieued,</l>
                  <l>What had he done (trow you) if he had liued?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The verse hath a fine conceipt, and perhaps better then it showes for. Now (as I say) <hi>M. Neuell</hi> praising Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> in the like manner, vseth the like application, as mine author doth in this place, preferring his fortunatenesse in this kinde, before his, whom <hi>Alexander</hi> enuieth: for he saith (as I remember)
<q>
                  <l>Plectra canant alios, cecinerunt sceptra <hi>Philippum,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Ista coronatis sunt carmina digna cothurnis.</l>

                  <l>Of crowned Poet, and of Laureat king.</l>

            </p>
            <p>Concerning the tale of <hi>Drusilla,</hi> it is taken out of <hi>Plutarke,</hi> and thought a true Story: it is both in the Courtier of Castaglion and in <hi>Apuleius</hi>; but somewhat amplified by mine author.</p>

            <p>Concerning the Orations of <hi>Agramant, Marsilio,</hi> and <hi>Sobrino,</hi> a man might make a long, &amp; not vnnecessary discourse of the matter, but that I haue taken vpon me to note, and not to discourse: First therefore in <hi>Agramant</hi> we may obserue how young couragious Princes (such as he is described to have bin) are egged on by their grand minions (to whom peace is a penance) to warre vpon other mens countryes, and many times leaue their owne vnguarded: In which kind, fooles sometimes giue wiser counsell then they. As in the time of that good king of France <hi>Francis</hi> the first, they report that when he inuaded Italy, he consulted with his counsell, where he were best to enter Lombardy: some aduising one way, some another, a foole standing by, and hearing their consultation, came in amongst them and sware that they were all fooles: for (saith he) here is euerie man that aduiseth the king how to enter into Italy, but none of you takes care how he shall get out againe: this though accounted (as it was) but a fooles bolt for the time, yet proued too true afterward: for in that iourney the king was taken, and was sent prisoner to a Castle in Spaine called Madrillo.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Marsilio</hi> and <hi>Sobrino,</hi> we may see the qualities of a good counseller to a Prince, and a bad, one hauing only a regard to his owne priuat, the tother plaine and faithfull, and carefull for his Princes best safetie. In that <hi>Sobrino</hi> the good and faithfull counseller, aduiseth to make an end of the war one way or other, either by taking or paying tribute, one may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue that indeed it is no policie for Princes, but the vtter ruine &amp; beggering of their Realmes, to prolong their wars, &amp; to trifle away money &amp; time in such serious causes, &amp; be as vncertain in the end as in the beginning. The saying of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; wise councellor (another <hi>Sobrino</hi>) in England, is worthy to be remembered, that with a prety tale he told, vtterly conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned such lingring proceedings. The tale was this, a poore widow (said he) in the country, doubting her prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wood would not last all the winter, &amp; yet desiring to rost a ioint of meat, &amp; a hen one day to welcome her frends, laid on two sticks on the fire, but when that would not scarse heat it, she fetched two more, &amp; so stil burning them out by two and two (wheras one fagot laid on at the first would haue rosted it) she spent foure or fiue fagots more then she needed; &amp; yet when all was done, her meat was scorched of one side, and raw of the tother side: her frends ill content with their fare, and she enforced ere winter went about, to borrow wood of her poore neighbours, because so many of her owne fagots were spent.</p>

               <hi>Cresus</hi> was the king of Lydia, who thought himselfe happie for his riches: but <hi>Solon</hi> was of another opinion, and therefore thought a foole by him, till in the end <hi>Cresus</hi> being bound at a stake, to be burned by his victorious enemy, he cryed out on the name of <hi>Solon,</hi> and through that thicke and darke smoke, he could see that wisedome, which before his eyes dazled with foolish wordly felicitie could not see.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crassus</hi> called also the rich <hi>Crassus,</hi> a Citizen of Rome, his saying was, that no man was rich that could not with his bare reuenue maintaine a Royall army: which if it be a true saying, I doubt whether any Prince Christened at this day be rich. <hi>Crassus</hi> in reproch of his couetousnesse, had molten gold poured into his mouth by the Parthians, who tooke him prisoner and slew him. <hi>Cambises</hi> sonne of <hi>Cyrus</hi> king of Persia hauing conquered Egipt, inuaded the Ammonians with a great armie, but for want of victuals was forced to giue ouer his enterprise.

Concerning the Owles of Athens, <hi>Tully</hi> vseth the phrase <hi>Hoc est Athenas noctuam mittam.</hi> But the saying rose not so much for the plentie of those birds, as because they had a coigne stamped with the same; as appeares in <hi>Plutarke</hi> in the life of <hi>Lysander,</hi> where it was laid to the charge of a grèat officer named <hi>Gilippus,</hi> that he roosted too many Owles in the penthouse of his house, which was indeed, money that he had stole in that kinde of coigne, and hidden there.</p>

In that <hi>Rogero</hi> in his extremity of danger, feeleth a remorse of conscience, &amp; straight hath recourse to God by prayer and vow, it is a good president for others to do the like, though indeed most men are apt to do so, but all the matter is, to performe the effect of their vow &amp; promise to God after, for that few care for, according to that saying, made a prouerb in Italian,
<q>
                  <l>Scampato il pericolo giabbato il santo,</l>
                  <l>When danger is scaped, the Saint is — mocked.</l>
               </q>
But the example of <hi>Rogero</hi> may moue vs to more true deuotion; and this speech of the good old Hermit, let euerie one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to himselfe that hath need of it, and it may fortune do him as much good as a sermon; for indeed it is most sweet and comfortable and verie true doctrine, and well beseeming the person of a deuout old man (as I called him in the <hi>54</hi> staffe) for seldome goeth deuotion with youth, be it spoken without offence of our <hi>Peckedeuanted Ministers</hi>: as there goes an old tale of three things that a blind man could see, for when his boy told him that there was brought a verse braue horse, then saith the blind man, I see he is far: the boy maruelled how he knew it; next he told him, there came by a passing faire woman, then I see she is young (quoth the blind man) well guessed Master said his boy. Lastly, came by a deuout preacher: Sir quoth the boy, here comes a good Priest, then he is old said the blind man, and that guesse was so right, the boy was affraid his Master had had his eyes againe. For indeed age and bodies chastised with fasting and studie, are companions of deuotion: as a frend of mine was wont to say in Italian,
<q>
                  <l>Dio mi guarda Da medico rognoso,</l>
                  <l>Dio mi guarda Da alchumista stracciato,</l>
                  <l>Dio mi guarda Da monacho ingrossato.</l>
               </q> God defend me from a mangie Phisition, (for the Phisition that cannot cure the itch in himselfe, will hardly cure other greater diseases in another.) From a ragged or beggerly Alcumist, for he that cannot get himself good clothes, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turne lead into gold. From a corpulent or fat fed Frier: for he that feeds his owne bodie fat, is not likely to giue of the best spirituall food of the soule.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Brandimart</hi> that laboreth to perswade <hi>Agramant</hi> to peace, we may note a noble disposition, and excellent good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that being verie stout, and treating of peace (as they say) with his sword in his hand, yet endeuoured to take up the qûarrell before it came to bloud, which though it be a thanklesse office many times (as here it hapned to <hi>Brandimart</hi> to be scorned for his labour) yet ought not that to terrifie a good mind from so honest an office. And sure the cause why great quarrels rise vpon small matters, betweene great personages, and are afterward so long ere they be reconclied, and so hollowly reconciled at last; is that some of a wicked pollicie, seeke to keepe them at variance, thinking it (as the prouerbe saith) best fishing in troubled waters: but neither <hi>S. Peter</hi> that was the good fisher of men nor his Master, were of that opinion, but do say contrarily, <hi>Beati pacifici.</hi>

            <p>In this kind we haue had many in our time, as the happie <hi>17.</hi> day of Nouember can witnesse, that haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of deuice: of which if I should speake at large, it would aske a volume by it selfe. My selfe, have chosen this of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuero</hi> for mine owne, partly liking the modestie thereof, partly (for I am not ashamed to confesse it) because I fancie the spaniell so much, whose picture is in the deuice, and if any make merrie at it. (as I doubt not but some will) I shall not be sorrie for it: for one end of my trauell in this worke, is to make my frends merrie, and besides I can alledge many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of wise men, and some verie great men, that haue not onely taken pictures, but built cities in remembrance of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable beasts. And as for dogges, Doctor <hi>Caynes</hi> a learned Phisition and a good man, wrote a treatise in praise of them, and the Scripture it selfe hath voutchsafed to commend <hi>Tobias</hi> dogge.</p>

Wherefore first he proued his wiues, and after diuers other great Ladies, but he found none did him good but one poore gentelwoman, wherefore being recouered of his fight, he put all the other to death, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried that one: but because the matter of the cup is continued in the next booke, I shall speake more to this effect, in my notes vpon the same.</p>

            <p>In the tale of the Mantuan knight may be gathered this good morall,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Morall.</hi>
               </note> that it is no wisedome to search for that a man would not find: and how the first breach commonly of the sweet concord of matrimonie, groweth of iealousie, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, these be two knauish tales that be here in this booke, and yet the Bee will picke out hony out of the worst of them. For mine owne part I haue euer bene of opinion, that this tale of the Mantuan knight, is simply the worst against women in all the booke, or rather indeed that euer was written. The hosts tale in the xx viij booke of this worke, is a bad one: M. <hi>Spencers</hi> take of the squire of Dames, in his excellent Poem of the Faery Queene, in the end of the vij. Canto of the third booke, is to the like effect, sharpe and well conceited; in substance thus, that his Squire of Dames could in three yeares trauell, find but three women that denyed his lewed desire: of which three, one was a courtesan, that reiected him because he wanted coyne for her: the second a Nun, who refused him because he would not swear secreacie, the third a plain coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Gentlewoman, that of good honest simplicitie denyed him: which also hath some liknes with that of <hi>Pharao</hi> I spake of in the notes vpon the 42. book: but this of the Mantuan knight passeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, if you marke the secret drift of it: shewing how a woman of so excellent education, so great learning, so rare beautie, so fine wit, so choise qualities, so sweet beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, so aboundant wealth, so dearly beloued by her husband, could so easily be conquerd with the sight of three or four iewels: and then for his comfort, how for ten yeares after, he being a great house keeper, all his married guests that came to him spilt the drinke in their bosomes. This tale (admitting it to be true or probable) would argue women to be of exceeding couetousnes, but loe how easily all this is not onely to be excused for them, but retorted vpon men: for assuredly it is onely the couetouseness of men, that maketh women (as we interpret it) to sell their chastities: for women indeed care for nothing but to be loued, &amp; where they assure themselues they are loued, there of their kind and sweet dispositions, they bestow loue againe. Now because men can protest and sweare, and vow that which they thinke not, therefore no maruel if women are hard of beliefe, and thicke listed to heare them: but when they come to giue things that cost money, and that the coyn begin to walke, which they are sure men esteeme so dearly, as they venter both body and soule for it many times, then no maruell if they belieue them, and thinke them to be in good earnest, and consequently yeeld to that they denyed before. But to go forward with the rest of the morall, both men and women may gather this morall out of both these tales; that as all vice is odious and base, so that which a bodie is hired vnto, is most shamefull and detestable.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Codrus</hi> dyed thus, the Dorians hauing warre with the Athenians, the Oracle told them of Athens, that if <hi>Codrus</hi> were slaine by the enemies, then the Athenians should haue the victorie: this newes being noised in the Dovians campe, they gaue straight charge that none should kil <hi>Codrus</hi>; but he minding to dye for the defence of his countrie, countersaited himselfe like a Pedler, or such like, and came to the campe of enemies, and picking a quarrell there of purpose with some of the souldiers, was slaine among them.</p>

               </note>This booke began with an excellent Moral, of the vnstablenesse and varietie of Fortune, which as it is plainly set downe and notably proued by examples, so if a man will rightly apply it to his owne state, I know not whether any thing in this whole worke hath bene, yea or can be said to better purpose, not onely for humanitie, but in some sort for diuinitie. For in matters of the world who knoweth not, that the wisest counsell a man can giue, and the wisest course a man can take is this, <hi>Vtnecoppressus sis aduersis rebus necelatus secundis,</hi> neither to be abasht with aduersitie, nor puffed vp with prosperitie: and in diuinitie (as the most learned diuines haue written) the two onely rocks at which our vessells make shipwrade, the <hi>Silla</hi> and <hi>Caribdis</hi> that drown so many thousand Christians in this their worldly passage, are these two extreames, of presumption and dispaire: betweene which two, he that can keepe his course euen, it is vnpossible be should miscarrie, but by wonderfull, and euen most wilfull negligence.</p>
            <p>In the great curtesie vsed by <hi>Leon</hi> toward <hi>Rogero,</hi> and afterward by <hi>Rogero</hi> toward him, as is shewed both in this booke and the next, we may note first the wonderfull effects of vertue, that breeds loue, not in strangers onely, but euen in enemies: secondly we may see that a man of a true noble nature, thinks himselfe more bound to requite a benefit, then to reuenge an iniurie. For to fayle in reuenge often proceedeth of vertue, but to be vnthankfull, is a most hatefull thing euen in the greatest, and can neuer proceed but from a most vile nature.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Charles</hi> may be noted the iust and moderate proceeding of a wife and discreet Prince, who when the controuersie about <hi>Bradamant</hi> began to grow so intricate, that it was hard to discouer where the right was, in the hearing of the matter, he shewd no maner of partialitie, and in the end referred <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the determining of the free Court of Parliament, thereby shewing, that he presumed not too farre of his owne wit, and that he meant to haue the matter heard openly and indifferently; and yet he did wisely remoue from himselfe, the enuie and grudge that might grow to him by giuing a definit sentence in a cause so ambiguous, which a wise Prince will eschue as much as may be, specially when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall concerne great personages.</p>

               <hi>Dionysius</hi> a tyrant of Sicilie (and sonne of that tyrant that spoiled the Churches, and tooke away a cloke of gold from <hi>Iupiter,</hi> saying, a cloth cloke was lighter for summer, and warmer for winter: and tooke away <hi>Aesculapius</hi> golden beard, saying, it was a sawcie part for him to haue a long beard, and his father <hi>Apollo</hi> to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e none.) This <hi>Dionysius</hi> (that we may see how well the children of them prosper, that scorne the false gods and beleeue not in the true) continued his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tyrannie in Syracusa, and was by them inforced to flye the Realme; so as being a runnegate hauing no meanes to liue, he went to Corinth, and liued there a priuate and meane life: as in the life of <hi>Tymoleon</hi> in <hi>Plutarke</hi> is set downe at large, and is verie well worth the reading, for the many prettie sayings and pleasant scoffings that were giuen him, and some returned by him againe: as that, of one that in derision comming into the roome where <hi>Dionysius</hi> sat (in a blinde tauerne, or alehouse) shooke his gowne, (so they vsed to do, that came to the presence of tyrants, to show they had no wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons about them) tush saith <hi>Dionysius,</hi> this was needlesse at your comming in, but at your going out it would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, to see if you steale nothing with you. Yet this vertue <hi>Dionysius</hi> had, (if a tyrant can haue any vertue) that he bare his aduersitie not onely patiently, but euen pleasantly, which is surely praiseworthy, according to that I spake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Morall, not to be abashed with euill fortune, which also <hi>Dionysius</hi> himselfe confessed he had gotten by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy: and sure it is a point of good courage to be able to beare aduersitie, according to that saying:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Fortiter ille facit, qui miser esse potest.</hi>

            <p>Of <hi>Marius</hi> I need not speake much, considering how largely his whole life is set downe in the forenamed <hi>Plutarkes</hi> liues, onely I will adde a word of <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> opinion of his fortune. Nothing in the world (saith he) could be more variable then the state of <hi>Marius</hi>: For if you will place him among the vnfortunate, you shall find him most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if among the happie, you shall finde him most fortunate.</p>
            <p>Two examples are alledged by mine author of this age. <hi>Lewes</hi> the <hi>12.</hi> of France, and <hi>Mathia Coruino</hi> of Hungary. Of these two a word: <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. king of France conceiuing some displeasure against the Duke of Orleans, father to to this <hi>Lewes,</hi> cut off his head, and was in some doubt and mammering if he should not do as much to his sonne, yet after many hard aduentures, it was his hap at last to be king of France.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mathia Coruino</hi> was kept in close prison by <hi>Vladislaus</hi> king of Hungarie, because his elder brother had slaine the Earle of Cyglia, vnckle to the said king, but the king dying young and without issue, this <hi>Mathia</hi> was made of a priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a Prince: but of this kind of sodaine change, our Realme hath one example, that passeth not onely these, but all (I thinke) that haue bene heard of, or written: and that is the Queenes most excellent Maiestie that now is, who from the expectation of a most vndeserued death, came to the possession of a most renowned kingdome: for what greater extremity could one come from? or what greater felicitie might one come to? She that was sent for from Asbridge, with comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to be brought either aliue or dead, she that was committed to the Towre of London, she that was so often and so straightly examined: she that demanded if the Lady <hi>Ianes</hi> scaffold were taken downe, doubting to play on the same such another Pageant; she that doubted murdering if her keeper had bene an ill disposed man, she that sent word to her seruants that came to know how she did <hi>(tanquam ouis:)</hi> lastly, she that wrate in the window at Woodstocke with a Diamond:
<q>
                  <l>Much suspected by me, <hi>quoth</hi> Elizabeth <hi>prisoner</hi>:</l>
                  <l>Nothing proued can be, <hi>quoth</hi> Elizabeth <hi>prisoner</hi>:</l>
               </q>
Became of the sodaine a crowned Queene, with greater applause, then either <hi>Lewes</hi> in France, or <hi>Coruino</hi> in Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and not onely hath raigned, but doth raigne most happily. All which her highnesse troubles, my selfe haue the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cause to remember, because the first worke I did after I could write Latin, was to translate that storie out of the booke of Martyrs into Latin,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>This little booke was given to her Maiestie.</hi>
               </note>as <hi>M. Thomas Arundell</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Hobby</hi> can tell, who had their parts in the same taske, being then schollers in Eaton as I was, and nmaely that last verse I remember was translated thus:
<q>
                  <l>Plurimi de me malè suspicantur,</l>
                  <l>Attamen de me mala non probantur.</l>
                  <l>Elizabetha</l>
                  <l>carcere clausa.</l>
               </q>
And thus much for example of the change of fortunes.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Bradamants</hi> fight against <hi>Rogero,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Allegorie.</note>we may see how our opinion blinded with a false supposition, striveth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times most vehemently against that it would be loth to ouerthrow, if it were rightly informed.</p>

For this was not a malicious taunt of a wry-looking <hi>Zoylus,</hi> but a graue reprehension, and commination of a deuout and diuine writer; Now though the Epithetons of <hi>Dissolute</hi> and <hi>Loose,</hi> make me partly presume, that mine author is out of the foresaid danger, whose worke cannot iustly be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med lasciuious, wanton, nor carnal, and though I haue spoken as I thinke sufficiendy in my Apologie, to satisfie all indifferent readers, both for mine authors defence and mine owne excuse, yet because I know in mine owne conscience, that all the verses in this worke be not so full weight, but if they shalbe tryed in so seuere a ballance, some will be found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny graines too light: I would endeuour all I might to supply that detect, with the more weightie and sober consideration of the Allegorie; which, as I haue partly touched in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seuerall booke, so now I intend to present to your consideration the whole bodie of the same, to make as it were a rehearsal Oration of it, which I haue placed in the latter end,

and as it were for a farewell, as men do at a great dinner, in which they haue almost surfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon sundrie sorts of meats,<note place="margin">

Also I do the rather place it in the end of my booke, because commonly, that which men reade last stickes best in their memories, and so I wish this to do, being as it were the verie kyrnell and principall part, or as the marrow, and the rest but the bone or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable shell; or according (as I said in my Apologie, vsing <hi>Tassoes</hi> comparison) like to the pill that is lapped in suger, and giuen a child for a medicine, who otherwise would not be drawne to take the simple drugge though it were to saue his life. But to come to the matter, mine author (as you may see from the beginning) applyeth his whole worke, and referreth all the parts thereof to two principall heads and common places: namely,<note place="margin">

For these two faults of wantonnesse and wilfulnesse, are so coupled commonly with youth, that they seeme to be borne at a burthen therewith, and as it were accidents insepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and a man might almost canonize him for a Saint, that hath passed the heat of his youth, and not offended in one of these: but many doubtlesse offend in them both. And this is the cause that mine authour hath propounded many examples, but speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally two,<note place="margin">

               </note>in the which men may see their frailtie in the latter of these (which I will handle first) namely in the passion of loue.

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:7215:214"/>
Wherefore the auncient fathers haue not without great iudgement and iust cause placed slouth among the seauen deadly sinnes, being so precise in the confideration thereof, that they haue deliuered their opinion thus farre of it, that though simply to be idle is not a mortall sinne (as they terme it) yet so to be idle as to be kept thereby from some good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, as hearing of Gods word, or helping out brother that wanted out assistance, may make it mortall. But now, because in common sence it had not bene fit nor probable, that a man of a high spirit and noble courage (as his <hi>Rogero</hi> is described to be) should be daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with such a shamefull and base companie as these were, therefore you see he defends himselfe against them most resolutely, though their assault seeme terrible, and their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber infinite,<note place="margin">

               </note>and in despight of them he proceedeth towards the house of <hi>Logestilla</hi> (by which is meant vertue) by that craggie and painfull way, and shunneth the other way to <hi>Alcyna,</hi> by meanes of the good warning <hi>Astolfo</hi> had giuen him of the daunger thereof. But loe two faire yong Ladies sent from <hi>Alcyna,</hi> which as I noted in the seuenth booke, caried a shew of honourable and chast loue; these wanne him without any resistance, and make him of a resolute warriour, a dissolute louer: but trow you he can come to <hi>Aleyna</hi> with the bare name of a louer? no, if he be poore, there is no place for him in dame Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures court;<note place="margin">

               </note>he must spend, he must giue, he must lash it out. <hi>Erifila,</hi> a couetous wretch, keeps the bridge, by which is vnderstood that many men are stopt from this course of folly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great charge and expence thereof, and so stay at this bridge; and though no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of vertue withhold them, yet feare of the charge doth terrifie them. But when <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifila</hi> is once ouerthrowne, then they are presently receiued into the bosome of <hi>Alcyna,</hi> then all the cheare, sporting, dauncing and courting that can be imagined is applied to the welcoming of this youthfull <hi>Rogero.</hi> Thus he is drowned and viterly ouerwhelmed in this gulfe of pleasure, which mine author hath set downe so liuely, as it were the very picture of the Prodigall sonne spoken of in the Scripture, giuen ouer to all vnthristinesse, all loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life and conuersation. But because the Poet knew very well, that youth of it selfe hath many good gifts of nature, if the same were applied, and that many yong men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to themselves againe, haue become notable members of their countreys, and worthy patternes of prowesse and vertue; therefore he deuiseth most excellently a meane whereby <hi>Rogero</hi> vnwindeth himselfe out of the bonds of <hi>Alcyna,</hi> shewing how one day being got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from her (a thing that seldome happened vnto him) <hi>Melissa</hi> recalled him againe, and gaue him that Ring that discouered all <hi>Alcynas</hi> trumperies, and made here odious in his sight: so as now he cursed her in his heart, and was ashamed that euer he had set his loue so basely. This is to be vnderstood, that a man besotted in the fond pleasures of this world, entring into godly consideration with himselfe of his owne estate,<note place="margin">

            <p>Therefore not without verie good cause doth the notable writer (I recited in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this treatise) lay downe in the very first chapter of his booke the daunger and inconueniences that grow to men for lacke of consideration, vsing also in another place among many his diuine similitudes this one, that men are caried by inconsideration to their euerlasting ruine without any striuing;<note place="margin">

            <p>The Faulkner, the horse, the hawke, the dogge, that do all assaile him after a strange fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, the particular Allegorie whereof, I touched in the eight booke, though to say truth
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:7215:215"/>
I needed not so curiously to haue sought for such a hidden meaning in them, when as the verie things themselues are so vntemperatly vsed by many, that they keepe them from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and more honorable actions: How many men giue themselues so extreamely to these hunters, haukes, hounds, and horses, that they cannot scarse affoord an houre to the studie of wisedome and temperance? though I do not vtterly condemne the honorable vse of them all, for recreation, so as a man would remember, <hi>Ne quid nimis,</hi> or as our English Prouerbe saith, Too much of one thing is good for nothing.</p>
            <p>Now when these difficulties be ouercome, then yet for a great while the way is paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the weather is hot, the Sunne parcheth, <hi>Rogero</hi> rideth solitarie without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or good fellowship; and by and by another temptation assailes him: Three Ladies sporting themselves by the seaside would stay him; one offers him wine increasing his thirst with the sight of it, another inuites him to alight, the third railes vpon him for his inciuilitie: The first of these is our concupisence, that with a perpetuall thirst still ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs couet things hurtfull for our selues: the second is ease, that is loth to sustaine too much labour, but is still perswading vs to giue ouer vertuous workes, because they are painfull: the third is the mockerie and lewd vse of the world, as I haue also noted in his place, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These three women though <hi>Rogero</hi> fled away, yet they followed him, which signifieth, that our owne imperfections euermore follow vs, neither can we be ridde of them, and it suffiseth not to ouercome them once, but that we must wage continuall battell with them. Now against this perpetuall miserie we are strengthened by discipline, &amp; made able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them, which is signified by the wise and graue Pilot, that transports <hi>Rogero</hi> by sea, from <hi>Alcyna</hi> to <hi>Logestilla</hi>; and in sooth it may well be called a sea, in which euerie waue is readie to ouerwhelme vs, and euerie storme able vtterly to discourage vs, if we had not a good Pilot both safely to guide vs, and chearfully to encourage vs, by telling vs what enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment we shall finde, if we come once into her harbour.</p>

            <p>These be the Captaines of that Armie Royall, that can ouercome legions, nay millions of vices: and sure if you will not allow the last of them for a principall leader, yet you must at least, make him treasurer and paymaster, or else it is great doubt that for lacke of pay, you will be driuen to Cassyre your bands. But to proceede, perhaps it will seeme strange to some, as it did to my selfe at the first reading, how it comes to passe that <hi>Logestilla</hi> and <hi>Alcyna</hi> are sisters, the one legitimate, the other a bastard; and that the bastard hath vsurped vpon the others state, and hath scarce left her aboue one strong hold. The exposition is this.</p>
            <p>The nature of man (by which is vnderstood our appetite or affection,) which ought to be subiect to reason, and to be gouerned thereby, this nature (I say) was at the first a lawfull child of God, and was by the spirite of God framed to his owne likenesse, there to gouerne and rule by reason and wisedome, so that afore nature was corrupted, all the partes of our minde were in a perfect accord and harmonie, vnder the gouernement of reason, or rather euerie one setting forward itselfe to vertuous actions: but when this first perfection was lost, and that same great rebellion was made, to the ouerthrow of that quiet and setled state, the heart became so weake, as it was not able to endure the continuall assaults of the passions that assayled it, and in the end was content to take part with them, against the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable part of the minde. And now euery part of the body engenders such seeds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, that nature is become a bastard sister to reason, and vsurpes that gouernement that is due onely to her, and leaueth her onely one castell, which was so strongly situated that it was impregnable: so that now reason is retired as it were to her principall fortresse, to the head, the rest of this kingdome being possessed (by <hi>Alcyna</hi>) by pleasure and fond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. Now then, what maruell is it, if this new <hi>Hercules,</hi> described by mine author, do with so great difficultie, and through so many impediments, cla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer vp to this stately seate of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestilla,</hi> built with such rare workemanship, and of such pure stuffe, that a man may in the walls thereof, see euen into his very soule and conscience:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>In these men see the vertue, and the vice,</l>
               <l>That clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth to their inward soule and minde,</l>
               <l>Who lookes in such a glasse may grow so wise,</l>
               <l>As neither flat'ring praises shall him blind,</l>
               <l>With tickling words, nor undeserued blame,</l>
               <l>With forged faults, shall worke him any shame.</l>
            </lg>
            <pb n="410" facs="tcp:7215:216"/>
            <p>As for those gildings and paintings, that were in the Pallace of <hi>Alcyna,</hi> though the show of it were glorious, the substance of it was drosse, and nothing but Alcumie, and cosenage: but these of <hi>Logestilla,</hi> be precious stones indeed, of inestimable vallue: The looking glasse and mirrour, that will shew vs how our soule and our minde is spotted; oh he that would vse such a glasse, what a notable Antidoton it would be against the poyson of flatterie?</p>
            <p>You faire Ladies, that spend so many houres in looking and prying in a glasse to see if this shadow sit handsomely, if your rebatoes be well set, if your wyers stand euen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your heads, and the pendent iust in the middle of your forheads, and in the least of these matters you will not beleeue your maids eyes, but you will see it your selues, why are you so credulous to beleeue lyers and flatterers, that tell you your chastities and other womanlie vertues be extolled and praysed, and will not looke in that true glasse, to see if you deserue it or no?</p>
            <p>It is true, that men are no fit iudges of themselues, because commonly they are parciall in their owne cause, yet is it as true, that he that will dispose him to iudge indifferentlie of himselfe, can do it better then any bodie else, because a man can see further into his owne minde and heart, then any one else can. But now, to come to this faire house of <hi>Logestilla,</hi> to which I would so fayne inuite you all, both Lordes and Ladies, that reade this discourse, here be sweete gardens, here be wholesome herbes, here is the continuall spring: Here that vnbridled horse, that bare away <hi>Rogero</hi> so farre out of Europe, is taught to obey the rodde and the rayne, and made seruiceable and at commaundement. Further, by the helpe of the ring (as was touched before) manie that had bene transformed into brute beastes, were restored to their shape againe: these were such as were so drowned in vice, and in beastlie pleasures, that no part of the reasonable man was left in them. <hi>Astolfo</hi> was restored to his shape, that had bene turned into a myrtle, (now the myrtle was said euer to haue bene <hi>Venus</hi> tree;) and because he was so entangled in Venerie, that he could not get himselfe out of it, therefore he is fayned to haue taken roote in the ground as the tree doth, and so was fastened, that without <hi>Melyssas</hi> assistance he could not haue stirred from thence. Thus, as you see mine Authour vnder a prettie fiction, hath brought you to behold the whole miserie of the life of man, and there in the beginning of the seuenth booke, he exhorteth men to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meaning of his tale,
<q>
                  <l>Wherefore to some my tale may seeme a fable.</l>
                  <l>Whose wits to vnderstand it, are not able.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But now because there are diuers kindes of errours, in this laberinth of loue, and as diuers meanes by which men offen, as there are diuers sortes of men that offend; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may perceiue how my aut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our hath filled the whole booke with sundry exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples both of men and women: as beside <hi>Orlando</hi> of whom I spake before, whose mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse gaue the name to his worke, calling it <hi>Orlando Furioso,</hi> there is <hi>Sacrapant,</hi> that followes <hi>Angelica</hi> from the Indies, and is still foded out by her with faire wordes: There is <hi>Renaldo,</hi> that is extreamely in loue with her, till the water of disdaine draue away, and cooled the heat of his affection; and the whole booke is full of examples of men and women, that in this matter of loue, haue bene notable in one kinde or other, of which I will touch some speciall ones, and omit the rest, as not so much worth the standing vpon.</p>
            <p>The ordinarie kindes of loue are set downe to vs of the good and the bad in two couples: <hi>Angelica</hi> and <hi>Doralice</hi> of the worse kinde, and <hi>Olympia</hi> and <hi>Bradamant</hi> of the the better sort. In <hi>Angelica,</hi> the excellentnesse of her beautie bred such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding pride, that disdayning the greatest and worthyest Princes that liued in that
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:7215:216"/>
age, she cast herselfe away at last vpon a poore seruing-man, for a iust recompence of her too haughtie conceipt. In <hi>Doralyce,</hi> is set downe a patterne of great lightnesse of manners and behauiour, that first louing <hi>Rodomont,</hi> and being forciblie taken by <hi>Mandricard,</hi> yet in one night was so well pacified toward him, that she was content to tarrie with him, and in the end refused <hi>Rodomont</hi> openlie for him, (though in so doing one might make a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable excuse for her:) but after when <hi>Mandricard</hi> was slaine, she could haue found in her heart to haue loued <hi>Rogero</hi> also. In <hi>Olympia</hi> contrarie, we see an honest chast loue, though very hardly required, yet hath it in my opinion some reproofe, namely that it was too sodaine and violent. But in the worthy <hi>Bradamant</hi> is a perfect patterne of true honorable loue to <hi>Rogero,</hi> moued first by his value, by his courage, by his behauiour, by his worth, which made him worthie of her loue. In her you shall finde no rashnesse, no want of constancie, of faith, of all other due regards: for neither could her sundry ouerthwart chances neither the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and length of time, (which is wont to breed alterations,) nor the obstinate couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of her father, nor the vaine ambition of her mother, nor the state and Empire of <hi>Leon,</hi> with all the promised riches and treasures his Father and he possessed, once withdraw her minde from her first loue. Further, <hi>Bradamant</hi> did not rashlie fall in loue, as did <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> but the Prophetesse <hi>Melyssa,</hi> and tokens from aboue, did encourage her to her honest loue, for showing her of her noble posteritie, and of all those blessings that accompanie the same: so as indeed, in her onely we haue a patterne of honest and commendable loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marriage.</p>
            <p>Now there are in like manner two payre of marryed women, one worthie all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, the tother meriting all praise. The shamelesse <hi>Orygilla</hi> and her filchie <hi>Martano,</hi> are a patterne of base and filthie loue, grounded vpon ribauldrie, and continued with all fraudulent practises that may be; in which also the fond affection, and doting fancie of <hi>Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fino</hi> is to be pitied, that could not see her trecherie til with notable shame and scorne, he felt the fruits of it.</p>
            <p>Another patterne of lewdnesse in all kindes, is the tragicall life of the abhorni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>Gabryna,</hi> that for her filthie lust, brake all the lawes of hospitalitie and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: First tempting <hi>Fylandro</hi> most impudentlie, then accusing him most falselie, lastlie circumuenting him most subtillie, and making him with a most rare crueltie to kill her husband, and marrie her selfe; and finallie when she grew wearie of him, she found the meanes to poyson both him and the Phisition, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting there, spent all her life after in working all kinde of treason and mischiefe, euen to her last gaspe, which she fetcht on the gallowes. Such <hi>Gabrynas</hi> and <hi>Medeas</hi> as this perhaps there are in the world, that to effect their diuellish purposes, will not sticke to practise any kinde of trecherie and poysoning, yea and take a pride and felicitie when they can ouerthrow noble houses, set great men together by the eares, cause bloudshed, and ruine, and hurlyburlie in Cities and common wealthes, and cause bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to cut off one anothers head: whereupon that old verse may seeme to haue bene made vpon some ground:
<q>
                  <l>Non audet Stigius Pluto tentare, quod audet</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But now in recompence of these two passing lewd women, we haue two excellent vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous women: <hi>Fiordeliege</hi> married to <hi>Brandimart,</hi> and <hi>Isabell</hi> espoused to <hi>Zerbino.</hi> Which, I thinke mine author hath deuised to haue great aduersities, and to haue lost their husbands most vnfortunatly, to the end to lay before all chast and vertuous matrones an example, how the troubles that happen to their husbands, must be a meane to set foorth their praise the more. And indeed, to attribute to them the highest point of glorie in this kinde that may be, you see how he maketh them leese their husbands euen in the prime of their owne
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:7215:217"/>
yeares: <hi>Zerbyno</hi> slaine in France, and <hi>Brandimart</hi> in Barbarie, and both of them naming their wiues at their last houre, to shew how dearely they loued them; which causeth them to breake into such piteous lamentations, as would moue not onely a tender hearted Ladie, but euen a valiant hearted man, to shed teares with compassion. Further, the deathes of both these Ladies, in sundry kindes are most admirable: <hi>Fiordeliege</hi> builds her a little roome in the sepulcher of her husband, and there becomes an Anchorite: <hi>Isabella</hi> falling into the hand of the barbarous <hi>Rodomont,</hi> and hauing no way to saue her chastitie from his violence, deuised a meane to redeeme it with the price of her life: Oh worthy <hi>Isabella,</hi> that deseruest to be painted in Tables, and set foorth in clothes of Arres, for an example to all young Ladies of constant chastitie.</p>
            <p>But now to goe forward, we haue to consider likewise of the inchaunted Pallace, in which as it were in an infinite laberinth, so many braue young men of great vallour, loose themselues in seeking their loues, and when they would depart thence, they heare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues called backe, and thinke they see their faces; but when they come, thinking to finde them, they vanish out of their sights, and turne to shadowes. This inchantment is likewise referred to loue, that painteth forth in our fancie, the Image of the party loued, representing to vs the sweete speech, the seemely behauiour, the gracious lookes of our Idol that we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: but neither can we finde it when we seeke for it, neither doth the heart take any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, still labouring to attaine to the end which more do misse then hit, and yet when they do attaine to it, for the most part they grow as wearie, as before they grew fond. We may say that <hi>Dido</hi> was in this laberinth, when as <hi>Virgil</hi> describeth her:
<q>
                  <l>At Regina graui iamdudum saucia cura,</l>
                  <l>Vulnus alit vaenis, &amp; caeco carpitur igni,</l>

                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> recurrat,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore this passion may well be called <hi>That tickling wound, that flat'ring cruell foe,</hi> as it is in the first booke. And no maruell if <hi>Rogero</hi> once againe, hauing lost his ring of reason, he drawne into this inchaunted Pallace. Onely <hi>Astolfo</hi> (taught by a booke <hi>Logestilla</hi> gaue him, to take away a fantasticall Image, or some such witchcraft as lay vnder the threshold) dissolued the inchauntment. But whereas it is said that <hi>Atlanta</hi> did build it, thereby to keepe <hi>Rogero</hi> in an idle life, therein he toucheth the fond tendernes of diuers parents ouer their children, who bringing them vp in wantonnesse, ease and pride, make them the more apt to fall into this inchanting laberinth. Many more examples are alledged by mine author: as that prettie Comicall tale of <hi>Ariodant</hi> and <hi>Genewra</hi>: the fantasticall tale of <hi>Norandino</hi> and <hi>Lucyna,</hi> that were lapt in goates skinnes: the death of <hi>Marganorres</hi> two sonnes: the tale of the Mantuan knight that had the married mens cup. All which haue good Moralities, and may be fitlie applyed to this common place of loue.</p>
            <p>Now the other common place is of armes,<note place="margin">

               </note> which indeed is more pertinent to matters of state (as tother is to priuate life and manners,) and in this mine author hath carried his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention verie daintilie, and well worth the marking. For he propoundeth to vs the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of two mightie Emperours, one of which directeth all his counsels by wisedome, learning, and Religion; But the other being rash, and vnexperienced, ruined himselfe and his counttrie: and in this storie though much of it be fayned, yet are set downe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ordinarie causes, and the vsuall sequels of all such garboyls and troubles. It is almost an vsuall matter to reade of young Princes, that being left in peace and prosperitie, and hauing so much wealth they know not what to do withall, straight follow their youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full humour of reuenging some (I know not what) old iniuries, and be put in hope by such hare-brayne Counsellours as <hi>Rodomont</hi> and his fellowes, of great conquestes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7215:217"/>
and in the end ouerthrow indeed great armies, not of their enemies, but of their owne, as, the Oracle mocked <hi>Craesus</hi>:
<q>

            <p>So did <hi>Hanniball</hi> in Italie (though indeed he preuayled a great while) led thereto by a dreame, as some write. Now in these matters of warres, the chiefe fault commonly is, in those Counsellors that put a sword into a mad-mans hand, by putting such conceits into Princes heads. Yet we see <hi>Agramant</hi> hath his graue <hi>Sobrino,</hi> that aduised him at the first, not to inuade other mens countryes, but to keepe his owne; that aduiseth him to preuent mischiefe in time, and to sue for peace: that aduiseth him to put the matter to a combat of one man, and the partie ouercome to pay yearely tribute: and finally, that not onely with faithfull counsell, but with valiant seruice, sticketh to him to the last; but <hi>Agramants</hi> owne rashnesse and follie ouerthrowes all the good that could be done him. Further these youthfull Counsellours, on whom <hi>Agramant</hi> did so much relye, did not onely hurt him by their fond perswasions to his ill succeeding warres, but also in the middest of the heate thereof, when their seruice should haue stood him in most steed, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed him, and in a manner quite confounded him with their continuall iarring and squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring among themselues about matters of small or no importance: So that, as <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> was wont to wish for ten <hi>Nestors,</hi> and could haue bene content to haue spared <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi>: so <hi>Agramant</hi> had iust cause to haue wished for ten <hi>Sobrinos,</hi> and to haue spared <hi>Rodomount,</hi> and the other great champions. And by the way it is to be noted, how Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticallie mine author sendeth Discord among them, and where she was found, as you might reade in the fourteenth booke. Now to <hi>Agramant</hi> is on the other side opposed <hi>Charles,</hi> a graue and well stayed Prince, wise and valiant, not parciall in doing iustice, bountifull in rewarding seruices, and which is all in all, deuout without hypocrisie, and putting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his affiance in God, and consequently in his extremities is ayded by God; and in the end obtaining a most happie victorie, driuing both his enemies out of his countrie, and gayning from them a great part of theirs. Further my author hath set downe diuers formes (as I may call it) of valiant men, though not all in a sort to be imitated, but some rather greatlie to be reproued; <hi>Mandricard</hi> is described to be exceeding full of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and withall verie quarrelsome, and yet with good successe: He takes <hi>Doralyce</hi> from her guard, he fights with <hi>Orlando,</hi> with <hi>Rodomont,</hi> with <hi>Marsisa,</hi> and still he holds his owne, But this good fortune is a cause to fooles of their ouerthrow; for (as our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Prouerb saith) <hi>So oft goes the pitcher to the water, at last it comes broke home. Mandricard</hi> would needs quarrell with <hi>Rogero</hi> about their cognisaunce, and by him is slaine after all his brauerie. This is written for a warning to such as are of <hi>Mandricardos</hi> disposition, to take heed of <hi>Mandricardos</hi> end.</p>
            <p>Likewise in <hi>Rodomont</hi> there was exceeding strength of bodie, as well as courage of minde, but the same was gouerned with no deliberation; which caused him to attempt, and to giue ouer things attempted very sodainly, which finally turned to be hurtfull to himselfe as well as to others.</p>
            <p>On the other side, <hi>Renaldo</hi> was a franke natured man, valiant &amp; curteous, <hi>Ferraw</hi> stout, but too ful of cracking, and therby procuring himselfe enmities: <hi>Orlando</hi> ful of clemencie as well as courage: <hi>Zerbino</hi> a patterne of a most noble &amp; thankful nature, and though not fortunate, yet most famous in despite of fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rogero,</hi> the verie Idea and perfect example of a true knight, that will by no meanes break his faith and his honour, that seekes no aduantage of the inchanted sheeld, that to be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to <hi>Don Leon Augustus,</hi> would leese both loue and life. and finally, that in defence of his honour killeth <hi>Rodomont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, as I haue often noted in the seuerall bookes, it is a verie pleasing thing to see the due punishment of the wicked doers, and the procurers of euill, as besides those I haue noted, you may see that none scapeth of the xxxij. kings that came out of Affricke, but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7215:218"/>
               <hi>Rogero</hi> and <hi>Sobrino,</hi> the one a perswader to peace, the other, a iust warriour, and true of his word.</p>
            <p>Beside, in <hi>Astolfo</hi> is a praise of learning, who with his sounding horne, by which is meant eloquence, and with his booke (betokening wisedome) both the gifts of <hi>Logestilla,</hi> becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a tamer of monsters, as well as a conquerour of men, and accomplisheth greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alone, then all the rest do with their force and armes.</p>
            <p>Further, in the praise of learning, and to moue Princes to fauour learning, he shewes how onely the pen of the learned is that that preserues the good fame of Princes, as for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon foolish Pamphlet-writers he condemneth them, likening them to Vultures, carren Crowes, and chattering Pyes, that are not able to saue their friends names from the lake of obliuion, because their writings are not durable. Thus much I thought good to note of the generall Allegorie of the whole worke, to giue you occasion to ruminate, as it were, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to disgest that, which you before in reading, did perhaps swallow downe whole without chewing. Now me thinke it is euen high time to take away, and bid much good do it you, or at least no harme do it you, or if you thinke it will for all this, the best phisicke I can prescribe you, is to take a leafe or two of S. <hi>Matthewes</hi> Gospell, or of S. <hi>Paules</hi> Epistles, and it shall restore you to your perfect health.</p>

Now (as I say) this being a common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, and as it were a due reward to men of good desert, no maruell if this Poet, whose
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:7215:218"/>
worke hath bene acceptable to so many thousands, haue also found this fauour to haue his life written, which hath bene done by three Italians that I haue read, namely <hi>Giero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, Porro</hi> of Padoa, <hi>Gierolamo Garofala</hi> of Ferrara, and by <hi>Simon Fornari</hi> of Rheggio: out of whose three reports I haue gathered this compendious treatise, to satisfie such as are desirous to know who this <hi>Ariosto</hi> was, whom I haue so greatly extolled in my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, as a benefactor of all studious mindes, and on whose worke I haue employed so much time, to put it into English verse, and to bestow so many notes as I haue done vpon the expounding of his Allegories, and whatsoeuer else I iudged fit for the readers of weaker ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities.</p>
            <p>First therefore you must know,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariosto his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage.</hi>
               </note> that the house or name of the <hi>Ariosti</hi> came first out of Bologna, (not as some haue vainely surmised deriued of the <hi>Aristij</hi> or <hi>Ariouisti</hi>) for yet their name is remaining in Bologna in good account and reckning, and was long since of that reputation for gentrie and wealth, that <hi>Margues Obyso</hi> the third of the house of Este, thought it no disparagement to him to marrie a wife out of that stocke, called <hi>Lippa Ariosta.</hi> This Ladie was of excellent beautie and wit, and bringing with her vnto Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra some of the Ariosti of her kin and followers, by her fauour and countenance, they so well fethered their nests in Ferrara in her life, that they held euer since the account of Gentlemen of the better sort: But (admit their familie were of good reckning before) yet the excellencie of this famous man we now treate of, by the consent of all that write of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His father.</hi>
               </note> hath greatly increased the account and credit thereof. His fathers name was <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Ariosto,</hi> and both his father and vncles bare offices in their countrey of good va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew, his mothers name was <hi>Aria</hi> of the house of <hi>Malagutsie</hi> in Reggio,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His mother.</hi>
               </note> as appeareth in one of his Satyres where he nameth her. Now though this <hi>Lodowike Ariosto</hi> were his fathers eldest sonne, yet he had foure brothers and fiue sisters, the names of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers himselfe set downe in his second Satyre, <hi>Charles, Alexander, Galasso,</hi> and <hi>Gabriell,</hi> where also he complaineth that <hi>Mercurie</hi> was no great friend to his house,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His brothers</hi>
               </note> meaning that their wealth was but small, because none of them had vsed to increase it by traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke or merchandize. Now though his father were a man of good reckning, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene in his youth a companion of Duke <hi>Borso,</hi> and after that an officer to Duke <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> in a good place, namely his <hi>Maiordomo,</hi> which I take to signifie as much as great master or steward of his house, and often employed as Ambassadour from him to the Pope, and to the king of France, and consequently receiued of him great preferments, as well in dignities, as reuenewes and fees, yet it seemeth that he liued euer so at the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of his abilitie, that he pursed vp little to the increase of his stocke, and thereby left his heire no verie rich man.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His towardnes in his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>
               </note> But to speake of the sonne of whom I chiefly intend my discourse, certaine it is that from his verie childhood, he shewed great tokens of forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in all studie, but specially in Poetrie, in so much that his father yet liuing, he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the tale of <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbee</hi> into verse, making in a manner a Comedie of it, and so caused his brothers and sisters to play it. Howbeit his father being vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, and rather regarding what studie would be most profitable to be followed by his sonne, then what his nature and inclination did best serue him to, compelled him to studie the ciuill law, in which hauing plodded some yeares verie displeasantly, and with no great proofe, at last he left it vtterly, and fell to more sweete studies; for the barbarousnesse of the phrase agreed not with the sharpnes of his conceit, in so much that he writeth of himselfe (though rather pehaps of his modestie, then that it was so)
<q>

                  <l>Inteso haurei quel che tradusse Esopo.</l>
               </q> That is to say, that being twentie yeare old, he had need of a schoolamaster to conster
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:7215:219"/>
               <hi>Esopes</hi> fables; though I see not how that could be, considering that being verie young, they say he made and openly pronounced an Oration in Latine, that gaue euen then great hope of him: the best likelihood is, that when his father set him to the Law, which he had no minde vnto, that then he lost his Latine againe, which is soone done, and so was glad to fall to it freshly, after he came to mans estate, which he did verie studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reading manie bookes, and especially <hi>Horace,</hi> whom he studied so thorowly, that he was able to expound diuers hard and obscure places in his Odes, which were then not vnderstood, and it is obserued, that when <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth was Pope, both his holinesse and diuers great Prelates in Rome fauored him greatly, euen in that respect. Thus as I said, his naturall inclination carrying him chiefly to Poetrie, he gaue himselfe to reade those Poets that were of best account, both in Latine and Italian, as his worke well shewes, in his oft and excellent imitations of them, and his gift was such, that though his youngest brother <hi>Gabriel</hi> wrote reasonable well, and by meanes of a lamenesse he had, gaue himselfe wholly to studie, yet he came so farre short of him, that there was no comparison: so that as one said of <hi>Tully, Satis est non modo in vna familia, sed in vna ciuitate esse vnum Rhetorem</hi>; it is enough to haue one good Orator not onely in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but euen in a whole Citie: So one may say of <hi>Ariosto,</hi> it is enough that all Italy had one so excellent a Poet. Yet he was often woont to lament as before him <hi>Petrarke,</hi> and before them both <hi>Ouid</hi> is noted to haue done, that his father still draue him from Poetrie, as that verse witnesseth,
<q>
                  <l>Abi lasso, quando hebbi al Pegaseo melo</l>
                  <l>L'eta disposta, e che le fresche guancie,</l>
                  <l>Non si videan auchorfiorir, d'vnpelo</l>
                  <l>Mio padre mi caccio con spiedi e lancie</l>
                  <l>Non che con sprom, a volger testi e chiose.</l>
                  <l>Em'occupo cing anni in quelle ciancie.</l>
               </q> But to proceed, when he had prettilie entered himselfe in Poetrie, and was of the age of foure and twentie, his father departed his life, and as I in part noted before, left him no rich man, whether that the inheritance was deuided among all the brothers, as in some places of England and Wales, the custome of the Gauell kinde alloweth, or that his liuing stood most vpon offices and fees that dyed with him: but thus they write, that he was then greatly perplexed with the charge of so great a familie, and with bestowing his sisters, and prouiding for his brothers, that he was euen readie to haue giuen ouer all his studie, had not the emulation that he had with a Gentleman of his owne name and kinne, called <hi>Pandolfo Ariosto,</hi> still renewed in him his former disposition: but in processe of time this <hi>Pandolfo</hi> dyed, with which his friend and cosin were greatly discouraged, and for a time againe discontinued, but yet so as the world before that time had some conceit of his sharpenesse of wit, and of his gift in well writing: In the end being toward thirtie yeares old, he was for his good parts entertained into the seruice of Don <hi>Hippolito</hi> Cardinall of Este,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His seruice of Cardinall Hippolito.</hi>
               </note> a great fauourer of learning and good witts, and one that kept continually in his court great store of excellent learned men, among whom <hi>Ariosto</hi> was receiued in verie honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sort: and yet to this time he had not written any worke of fame, but some few Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets: forbearing belike to write till he were well stuffed with matter; as wise buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders beginne not their buildings till they haue brought their Lime and stone and timber in place, left one should stay for the other. At his very entrance into this Cardinals ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, he determined, as it should seeme, to make some Poem, finding his strength to serue him to it, and though he could haue accomplished it very well in Latine, yet he chose rather
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:7215:219"/>
his natiue tongue, either because he thought he could not attaine to the highest place of praise,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Why he wrote not in Latine</hi>
               </note> the same being before occupied by diuerse, and specially <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ouid,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he found it best agreed with his matter and with the time, or because he had a desire (as most men haue) to enrich their owne language with such writings as may make it in more account with other nations: but the first of these was the true cause indeed, for when <hi>Bembo</hi> would haue disswaded him from writing Italian, alledging that he should winne more praise by writing Latine, his answer was, that he had rather be one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and chiefe Thuscan writers, then scarse the second or third among the Latines: adding, that he found his humor (his Genius he called it) best inclining to it. Wherefore going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with that resolution, of all the Poems that were then in that kind in manner of history (they were called Romanzi, which in French signifieth briefe notes of occurrents) he chose <hi>Boyardo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>So did Virgil by Homer for the same cause</hi>
               </note> vpon whose worke he would ground, both because he said <hi>Boyardos</hi> worke was fresh in euery mans minde, as also because he would shunne the bringing in of new names, and of new matter, which he thought would be nothing so pleasant vnto his countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as that of which they had some tast alreadie, and yet withall a desire to know fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of being by <hi>Boyardo</hi> left vnperfect. Thus (as I said) he began this worke of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Orlando Furioso,</hi> being about the age of thirtie yeares, and being entred into the seruice of Cardinall <hi>Hippolito,</hi> howbeit he did not so wholly giue himselfe either to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for the inriching of his owne wit, or to writing, for the pleasure and profit of others, that he withdrew himselfe from such honorable seruices as he was called to.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </note> For when Pope <hi>Iulio</hi> the second had intended to make warre vpon the Duke of Ferrara (whose bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cardinall <hi>Hippolito</hi> was) master <hi>Lodowicke Ariosto</hi> was chosen as a most fit man to go of Ambassage to him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His ambassage</hi>
               </note> to pacifie his wrath; the which busines he managed so well, that he wan great reputation of wisedome and discretion at his returning: Howbeit, it was not long after his returne, but that the forenamed Pope, being indeed a man of an vnquiet spirit, and giuen all to the warres, leuied a great power against the Duke, and shipped ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his souldiers, to send them ouer Poe the great riuer that runnes by Ferrara, these were met by the forces of the Duke vpon the water, and in that seruice <hi>Ariosto</hi> himselfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned himselfe verie valiantly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His seruice by sea.</hi>
               </note> and tooke one of the best shippes and best stored with victuall and munition in all the fleete. But these armies being dissolued, the Duke thought good once againe to send to pacifie that same ouer terrible Prelat; and euerie man shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the office, knowing the furious nature of <hi>Iulio, Ariosto</hi> againe for the seruice and safetie of his countrie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His second am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage.</hi>
               </note> aduentured to go, indeed an exceeding aduenture, for neither were the wayes safe in time of warres to go so weakely guarded; neither was that Popes displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure supportable where he placed the same; yet through both these dangers he waded, and presented himselfe to the Pope; but finding by some priuie intelligence, that the place was too hot for him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His danger to haue bene put to death.</hi>
               </note> he gat home againe with great perill to haue mard all his fine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, with the losse of that head from whence it came. For this seruice notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he was greatly both praised and fauoured. Now when things after by the good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the Duke, grew to more quiet, then he also betooke him to his quiet studies, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently did proceede in his excellent Poem: But sodainly, when he had made so much thereof, as gaue great hope to all men, that it would proue an excellent peece of worke, he happened to fall into the Cardinals displeasure, by meanes that he refused to go with him into Hungarie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His troubles.</hi>
               </note> which though the said Cardinall tooke verie displeasantly; yet knowing the valew of the man, and his worth, he would not disgrace him openly, though he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no enemies to feed and further that ill conceit in him; which master <hi>Lodowicke</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, was so greatly discouraged, that he intermitted his writing many yeares: and to mend the matter, one taking occasion of this eclipse of the Cardinals fauour, put him in suit for a peece of land of his ancient inheritance, which was not onely a great vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his minde, but a charge to his purse, and trauell to his bodie; for vndoubtedly, the clattering of armour, the noise of great Ordenance, the sound of trumpet and drumme,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:7215:220"/>

            <p>One of his Comedies called Casseria, he beganne in the life time of his father (though he intermitted it many yeares after) and one prettie accident they haue noted about it, which shewes his notable gift that he had to apply to imitation in his Poetrie, all that might with good iudgement be vsed in it.<note place="margin">

               </note> the Potter fortuned at that time to sing some staffe or other out of <hi>Orlando Furioso,</hi> I thinke that, where <hi>Renaldo</hi> requesteth his horse to carrie for him, in the first booke, the 32. staffe:

                  <l>Che l'esser senza te troppo minuoce.</l>
               </q> Or some such graue matter fit for a Potter, but he plotted the verses out so ilfauouredly (as might well beseeme his dustie occupation) that <hi>Ariosto</hi> being, or at least making sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to be in a great rage withall, with a little walking sticke he had in his hand, brake diuers of the pots; the poore Potter put quite beside his song, and almost

beside himselfe, to see his market halfe mard before it was a quarter done, in a pitifull sowre manner, between railing and whining, asked what he meant to wrong a poore man that had neuer done him iniury in all his life: yes, Varlet, quoth <hi>Ariosto,</hi> I am yet scarce euen with thee for the wrong thou hast done me here afore my face, for I haue broken but halfe a dozen base pots of thine, that are not worth so many halfe pence; but thou hast broken and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled a fine stanza of mine worth a marke of gold.</p>

                  <hi>His manner of building.</hi>
               </note> and being demaunded why he did not build it in more stately manner, considering what sumptuous pallaces, what stately porches, what goodly fountaines he described in his <hi>Furioso</hi>: he answered, that words were cheaper layd together then stones. Vpon the front of his doore he wrote a verse, that few of the builders of this latter age can truly write, or at least if they could, I would say their houses were strongly built indeed, for more then the third heire:
<q>
                  <l>Parna, sed apta mihi, sed nulli obnoxia, sed non</l>
                  <l>Sordida, parta meo sedtamen are domus.</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>One fault in his building was, he would often set vp and pull downe many parts thereof, and he would say of himselfe, that he vsed his house as he did his verses, mend them so much, that he mard them quite. For indeed, as a tree planted in an orchard, if it be once or twise well pickt and pruned, it doth further the growing of it, but if a man be euer sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about it, it will leese the naturall beautie, and hardly keepe life: so is it with one of his stanzes or staues, as we call them, at the first conceiuing of it, one may mend that which he shall sodainly set downe, but if one will still be turning and wresting of it, he may make it leese the grace it had at the first. But what fault soeuer himselfe did finde with his owne Verses, certaine it is that to all the great Princes of Italie they were most acceptable, as witnesseth the diuers great and honourable gifts they gaue him, as namely a pension of twentie pound by the yeare in Millan with an office to it giuen him by <hi>Hyppolyto,</hi> many sutes graunted him by the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> with great rewards from Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, from Cardinall <hi>Farnese,</hi> from Cardinall <hi>Bybiena,</hi> and chiefty from Marquesse <hi>Vasto,</hi> and diuers other meaner stares that for breauities sake are omitted. And because now I would also draw to an end, I will a little runne ouer that the hath bene sayd, with somewhat that hath bene forgotten, and so conclude, beginning from his birth.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>He was borne 1474.</hi>
               </note> He was borne the yeare 1474, in the Castle of Rheggio, his father being then gouernour of the Castle, it stands in Lombardie; he was tall of person, of complexion melancholy, giuen much to studie and musing, and would therewith sometime forget himselfe, he was of colour like an Oliue, somewhat townie in his face, but faire skinned otherwise, his haire was blacke, but he quickly grew bold, his forehead was large, his eye-browes thinne, his eye a little hollow but very full of life and very blacke, his nose was lar

His counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit was taken by <hi>Tytiano</hi> that excellent drawer so well to the life, that a man would thinke yet it were aliue; he was honoured with the Lawrell by the hands of the renowned Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles</hi> the fist, in the yeare 1532, which was a yeare before hee dyed. Now for his disposition as we haue partly touched before, he was of nature assable, not proud, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king lesse vpon him then others did yeeld vnto him, yet putting vp no knowne iniurie not of his betters; somewhat amorous in his youth, very secret, passing studious, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

fearefull vpon the water, and therefore when hee went out of a shippe at any time he would see others go before him, vsing that saying, <hi>De puppo neunssimus exi</hi>: though for mine owne part I see no great reason for it. Further, he was not very venturous on horse-backe, for they say he would light at every place of danger, though others rode o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it. He loued not to go much abroad out of his owne countrey, in so much as he writes in one of his Satyres,

That very night that he sickned and tooke his bed, there happened a great mischance, that was (in the opinion of most men) a presage of his death. The goodly Hall that <hi>Alfonso</hi> had beautified with the most sumptuous Stage that had bene seene in <hi>Ferrara,</hi> (purposely for <hi>Ariostes</hi> Comedies) was fiered by mischance, and consumed a great part of the Dukes pallace beside.

He tooke his sicknesse not onely patiently but euen chearfully, affirming that he was willing to die, and so much the rather because he heard that the greatest Diuines were of opinion, that after this life we should k
now one another, affirming to his friends that were by, that many his friends were departed, whom he had a very great desire to visite, and that euery houre seemed to him a yeare till he might see them. In fine, he dyed in <hi>Ferrara</hi> the eight of Iuly, 1533, and though he were worthy of all honor,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:7215:223"/>
yet this was all the honour he had done at that time, that the Monkes of <hi>S. Benet</hi> buried him in their Church (and contrary to their custome, which is neuer to go to burials) went with him to his buriall, and that there was scarce a man that could write, but did honor him with an Epitaph, his bones were after taken vp by one <hi>Sygnor Augustino,</hi> and layd in a very faite tombe, with his statue from the girdle vpward, in the forenamed Church of <hi>S. Benet.</hi> And now to close vp this whole discourse of his life, with the greatest prayse, hee was a most cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and honest man, as appeared both by his great care he had of his aged mother (whom also he speakes of often in his <hi>Satyrs</hi> and other writings (saying in one place.</p>
            <q>
               <l>L'eta di cara madre, mi percuote, De pieta il cuore.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And also by this example that is recited of him, of an aged Priest that hauing three or foure fat benefices, was in great doubt to be poysoned for greedinesse of them, by some that had the next Aduowsons, and in respect of the great honestie of <hi>M. Lodowike Ariosto,</hi> he chose him before all his owne kinne or friends with whom he would soiorne, as himselfe bosteth, and indeed it was a good boost,
<q>
                  <l>Mane di voi ne de pui giunti a lui</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, his learning, his good behauiour, his honestie, made him both beloued of all good men in his life, and bewayled of all honest men in his death, so as me thinke rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ouer his life, I could find in my heart to wish (sauing for some very few things) <hi>Sie mihi countingat viuere fisq, mori.</hi>
