            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEing about to Publiſh this Sermon, I
could not bethink my ſelf how to make
a more ſeaſonable Dedication of it,
than to You All: being you are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually

Civil Intereſt, to maintain that greateſt of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
which Herein I have endeavoured to
defend. That the Well-being of this Church
and Kingdom depends upon this, Every one
knows; and I hope, we need not be admoniſhed
to look to the Corner-Stone. What it is that
ſome Men would have, God Almighty only, and
Themſelves (if Themſelves) do know: however
it is to be wiſhed, that whilſt They are decrying
of Ours (without doubt the Beſt of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)

They be not buoying of Theſe up in the

               <hi>May the Great GOD of Heaven and

of the Twelve Apoſtles bear record, that there
cannot be a ſurer note of a Schiſmatick, than to
<hi>deſpiſe Dominion,</hi> and to caſt Dirt in the face of
our Natural Lord.</p>
            <p>It is not only the Voice of our Law, but we
likewiſe have the unanimous Aſtipulation, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages,
of the Laws of God, Nature, and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<hi>That a KING</hi> (being <hi>Deo ſecundus, ſoloque
Deo minor,) can do no wrong;</hi> that is, no wrong
for which he can be accountable to any but God,
being only his (and not the Peoples) Vicegerent.
And that I may evince this (I hope) beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
I have made choice of Holy <hi>Davids</hi>
Caſe, as being the moſt appoſite (to the beſt
of my Judgment) of any that I could meet
withal.</p>
            <p>What St. <hi>Hierom</hi> hath obſerved in the front of
many of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> (which he probably had out
of <hi>Origen,</hi> with whoſe Volumes his Juvenile Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
abounded; and <hi>Origen</hi> confeſſeth, that he had
it by Tradition from the <hi>Jew</hi> his Maſter;) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
true: <hi>viz. Titulum Pſalmi eſſe Clavem,</hi>
That the Key of each Pſalm is the Title. Which,
if we do conſult, it directeth us to the Second Book
of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the <hi>12th</hi> Chapter, where we find the
Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> in his Meſſage from God to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi>
reproving him for his Sin in the matter of
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> Whereupon the relenting Prince (being
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48578:4"/>
filled with the aggravating Circumſtances of ſo
great a Crime) preſently falleth into that Pious
Confeſſion, in the <hi>13th</hi> Verſe of that Chapter; <hi>I
have ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as if that had been too ſmall a Pennance,
upon ſecond thoughts (which are always preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
to be the moſt ſound and ſearching) he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
this Pſalm; ſighing out his <hi>Miſerere mei
Deus, Have mercy upon me, O God: for againſt
thee only have I ſinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In doing right to this Text, I ſhall omit the
Gloſſes of ſome later Expoſitors, eſpecially thoſe of
the <hi>Geneva</hi>-Faction; and that I may the more
exactly ſhew you, what was the Judgment of the
Primitive Chriſtians in this weighty Point of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance;
I ſhall cite the <hi>Councils,</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> as
being the ſureſt Witneſſes in this Particular: and
having been approved by the Univerſal Church of
Chriſt, no good Man can have the leaſt occaſion to
doubt of their Fidelity. And to theſe Teſtimonies,
I ſhall add the Judgment of the immortal <hi>Hugo
Grotius,</hi> to whoſe Books, and Memory, for his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
in this Point, all the Princes of Chriſtendom
do owe Protection.</p>
            <p>And that theſe things may be the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible,
I ſhall move in this moſt eaſie, and natural
Method. Wherein I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the Defection of Nature is ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal,
that even Kings can plead
no Immunity from it, no Priviledge
againſt it.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48578:5"/>
2. That althô the Depravity of Nature
be general; yet it is the Sacred Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of Kings only for their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
to be exempted from all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Jurisdiction.</item>
               <item>3. That ſuch are the Impetuoſities of the
Vulgar, that notwithſtanding this
Sacred Reſerve, Majeſty it ſelf can
ſcarce any where be inviolable.</item>
               <item>4. That ſince the Perſons, and Power
of Kings are eſteemed Sacred, both by
the Laws of God, Nature, and all
Nations; I ſhall exhort all Men,
that they be to the utmoſt of their
Power careful, not to violate ſo great
a Priviledge.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>That the Defection of Nature is ſo univerſal,
that even Kings can plead no Immunity from it, no
Priviledge against it.</hi> The Empire of Sin, after
the Fall of Man, was ſo general, that no Man can
be excluded, that will not deny himſelf to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s
Off-ſpring. And thus we have the great
Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> aſſerting, that <hi>in Adam all
died:</hi> And Holy <hi>David</hi> confeſſing, <hi>In ſin was I
conceived, and in iniquity did my Mother bring
me forth.</hi> But it is needlefs to inſiſt upon Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
when as the Wiſe Man hath included all in
his Parentheſis, <note place="margin">1 King 8. 46.</note>
               <hi>There is no Man that ſinneth
not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48578:5"/>
The Nature of this Propoſition is ſuch, as you
hear it is univerſally granted: therefore needeth it
no further Proof. Neither will any one be ſo ſimple
as to go about to exclude Princes from it, till that
day approach, when both They and We (Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
being laid aſide) ſhall be equally exempted.
Till then both Gratitude and Intereſt, oblige us to
cover the Faults of our Superiours. And therefore
I ſhall proceed to ſhew,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That althô the Depravity of Nature be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
yet it is the Sacred Priviledge of Kings
only, for their offences, to be exempted from all
Humane Juriſdiction.</hi> In the former Propoſition
we have ſeen, that they by whom the Actions of
Men are weighed, and upon whom <hi>Proemium &amp;
Poena,</hi> the two Hinges of all Law do turn; are not
able ſo far to ſmother the <hi>Embryon</hi> of Original De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity,
but that it will (in ſpight of the utmoſt
care and vigilance) burſt from the Seed to the
Fruit, into actual Impiety and Tranſgreſſion. But
yet for all this are they not in the leaſt liable to the
Cenſure of any Man; No Tribunal under Heaven
hath power to take cognizance of them, or call
them into queſtion. The Prophet in our Text,
tho a King, confeſſeth his Tranſgreſſion: but it is
with Reſerve of Juſtice unto none, but to him,
whom alone he owned Superiour; and therefore he
crieth, <hi>Againſt thee only have I ſinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſome of our Moderns might evade this
plain ſence of the Text, they have invented one,
which as they think will do the buſineſs. Namely,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48578:6"/>
that <hi>David</hi> ſinned in a double reſpect; One, as a
King: Another, as a Private Perſon. (If theſe be not
the Notions of <hi>Forty Eight</hi> let the World judge.)
As he was a Private Perſon (ſay they) he was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
to his Neighbour, as well as to God, having
been injurious to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer: <hi>Davids</hi> Repentance here,
was either Feigned or Sincere; Feigned it could
not be, as appears by the circumſtances; neither
will they ſuppoſe it. And if Sincere, how cometh
it to paſs, that in his Confeſſion, he hath no reſpect
to his injured Neighbour? But here lieth the
bottom of the buſineſs; If they could juggle the
World into a belief, that <hi>David</hi> ſinned as a Private
Perſon, then the unavoidable conſequence would
be; That he muſt be obnoxious to that Law, which
he had offended: and no Man is ignorant, that the
puniſhment of that Sin whereof <hi>David</hi> was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
was Death, by the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Statute. What is
this, but to ſeek a pretence for Regicide?</p>
            <p>That <hi>David</hi> was injurious to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> I do fairly
and readily grant. But, that he was a Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
neither They, nor all the World will ever be
able to convince me, it being not only abſurd, but
impoſſible. To ſay, that ſuch a one is a King, and
a Private Perſon too, is a flat contradiction, which
can never be reconciled: for wherever the one is,
it is impoſſible for the other to be there alſo, at one
and the ſame time.</p>
            <p>But whether <hi>David</hi> were Private, or no, this
was not the thing they aimed at; which was, that
he might be liable to Terreſtrial Puniſhment: and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48578:6"/>
then, whatſoever looked (tho never ſo ill) like an
Argument, muſt be brought to maintain it.</p>
            <p>Thus do Men become the Patrons of Error, and
render themſelves contemptible to all diſcerning
Perſons. <hi>David</hi> was no Private Perſon after he
was Anointed: this was nothing therefore, but a
diſtinction they had invented, and fitted for their
purpoſe: and either it (as I have ſhewed) or our
Logic muſt be falſe, Let them ſhew us one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and it ſhall be enough, of any Law, either
Divine, or Humane, of any Civilized Nation in the
World that owneth it: but this they cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only ingaged to their own crazed Heads for
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> was a King, and as ſuch, was (as other
Kings) above the Law. Kings have Power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with the Law at their pleaſure: Neither is
there the ſevereſt Puniſhment the Law can inflict,
but it is in the Power of the King to remit it; of
this <hi>David</hi> could not be ignorant: nay, he ſeems
to imply as much here; and by how much the more
he knew himſelf exempted from the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law,
by ſo much the more earneſt here he ſeemeth to
be with God for a Pardon, to whoſe greater Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
only he could be accountable. And of this
his Earneſtneſs, the Original is a ſufficient witneſs,
wherein the Pronoun is twice repeated; <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>But I haſt to be more particular, wherein I
ſhall undertake to prove, That</p>
            <p>For Subjects to queſtion the Actions (tho Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive)
or the Authority of their Princes, is a thing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48578:7"/>
that is moſt clearly Repugnant to Primitive Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom:
Inconſiſtent with the nature of the Kingly
Office: And Diametrically oppoſite to the Liberty
of the Subject.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It is Repugnant to Primitive Cuſtom.</hi> That
which Men call Religion, will in no wiſe allow the
Prerogatives of Kings to be called in queſtion. Thus
the thing was amongſt the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> when they
requeſted for a <hi>King to rule over them,</hi> like as other
Nations had, the Prophet anſwereth them, that
<hi>they ſhould have a King; and that their King
ſhould take their Wives and Children, their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Cattel, for his uſe and ſervice;</hi> as you
may read at large <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 8. But that which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
obſervable, is, that the Prophet in the whole
deſcription of that their King, who we know was
none of the beſt, never ſo much as ſetteth the leaſt
bound or limitation to his Power, maketh no obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of the extent of his Authority. Whereas,
if either this, or any other of the Precedent, or
Succeeding Authors of the Old Teſtament, had
but made any caſes of Reſiſtance or Reſtraint; I
make no queſtion, but the <hi>Antimonarchical</hi> Spirits
of theſe Times would have been diligent in the
ſearch, and diſcovery of them. But ſo far was
this from the buſineſs of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the reſt of the
Prophets; that they enjoyn Obedience (even to
the worſt of Kings) tho it be not only to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of Goods, but Life. And we do find it twice
pronounced (to make the Obligation greater) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
one of the moſt Inſolent, and Unjuſt, of all
their Kings; <hi>Who can lift up his hands againſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48578:7"/>
Gods Anointed, and be guiltleſs?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 7. &amp; 25. 9.</note> That Golden
Sentence of the Pſalmiſt therefore muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
have a like Relation to all Rulers; <note place="margin">Pſal. 105. 15.</note>
               <hi>Touch not
mine Anointed.</hi> And as the Law, ſo the Goſpel,
runneth high concerning Majeſty. Our Saviour
prohibiteth us from doing any man Injury or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice:
but much more muſt we pay that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and Reſpect to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which himſelf paid,
and commanded us to do the like. You will never
find him controverting the Actions of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or
his Delegates; but willingly ſubmitting to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they impoſed: as you may clearly ſee in the
Caſe of <hi>Tribute,</hi> wherein he proved to St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
that ſuch as were Freeborn were not liable to Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation:
<hi>Nevertheleſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leſt we be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
go thou to the Sea, and taking up a Fiſh, in his
mouth thou ſhalt find a piece of Money, that give
them for thee and me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, ſo far was Chriſt ſatisfied of the Power of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, that he ſuffered Death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sentence of <hi>Pilate</hi> the Governour; not
becauſe he wanted Power to make Reſiſtance, as
<hi>Porphyrius, Julian,</hi> and ſome others, did vainly
affirm againſt the Primitive Chriſtians: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would not in the leaſt ſeem to make any
Exception from that General Rule of <hi>Obedience to
Superiours,</hi> that he had laid down; for otherwiſe,
(as he ſaid) he could <hi>pray to his Father, who could
ſend him more than Twelve Legions of Angels,</hi> to
be his Aſſiſtants, and to reſcue their Sovereign
Lord, and Creatour, from the violence of that
hour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48578:8"/>
Thus alſo we find the Diſciples treading in their
Maſters ſteps, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi>thoſe two
great Doctors of the Circumciſion and Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
aſſerting this Royal Prerogative; <hi>Submit
your ſelves unto every Ordinance of Man,</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Peter,</hi> whatſoever ſome of his Succeſſours have to
ſay to the contrary) <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13, 14, 15.</note>
               <hi>for the Lords ſake, whether
it be unto the King, as Supream, or unto Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
ſubſtituted by him, for the puniſhment of
Wickedneſs and Vice, and for the praiſe of them that
do well: for ſo is the will of God, that in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
ye may put to ſilence the Ignorance of fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwerably hereunto S. <hi>Paul</hi> clearly evinceth the
neceſſity of <hi>Obedience</hi> to Supream Powers; telling
us, that <hi>ſuch are ordained of God; for which very
reaſon</hi> (ſaith he) <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>
               <hi>ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only
for wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake; for he that
reſiſteth the Power, reſisteth the Ordinance of God.</hi>
But notwithſtanding all this, our Enemies keep
rubbing up the old Sore, and in defiance of all our
Perſuaſions, and good Councils to the contrary,
they will underſtand St. <hi>Paul,</hi> better than he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
himſelf. Juſt in another Caſe, like to
<hi>Andreas Althamerus,</hi> who having taken up an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
prejudicial to Obedience, and Good Works;
and being not able to reconcile it with the Doctrine
of St. <hi>James,</hi> doth fairly therefore give St. <hi>James</hi>
the Lio, in a Book printed, ſince Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of <hi>Geneva,</hi> at <hi>Strasbourg.</hi> So they tell
us, that they are willing to Obey Powers, could
they have ſuch Powers as the Apoſtle meant of,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48578:8"/>
when he writ this Epiſtle. Wherein, alas, they are
miſerably miſtaken, for the Apoſtle writ this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to his <hi>Romiſh</hi> Converts, when they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Government of a Cruel Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
Thus eaſily can Mens Fancies lead them to
aſſert they know not what: Both They and We
have the greateſt cauſe to bleſs God, that we are
not under ſuch a Power as then was.</p>
            <p>And that which claimeth the next degree of our
Aſſent, after our Saviours Doctrine, and the Apoſtles,
is the Suffrage of the Univerſal Church, together
with the Practice of Primitive Chriſtianity, the beſt
(if not only) Interpreter of the New Teſtament. He
that conſulteth theſe, will find them unanimouſly
aſſerting the Propoſition we have now in hand. And
what good Laws were made for ſecuring the Royal
Rights of Kings, I ſhall refer the more, Intelligent
to read in the Univerſal <hi>Code,</hi> wherein you have
the Four General Councils of <hi>Nice, Conſtantinople,
Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> with the Five Primitive
Synods, of <hi>Ancyra, Neoceſaria, Gangres, Antioch,</hi>
and <hi>Laodicea;</hi> all which have been all along re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and approved, by the Univerſal Church of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And as this was the Opinion of the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, ſo doth it ſtill remain, (and long
may it do ſo;) there being no one Church in the
known World aſſerting otherwiſe; nor any ſound,
and ſober Member of any Church, as far as I was
ever able to learn: Except a few deluded Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a handful of
Zealous Fools in the Reformed Churches, who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48578:9"/>
have made themſelves ridiculous, and contemptible,
in the Eyes of all thinking, and judicious Perſons;
by aſſerting that, which the uninterrupted Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and Univerſal Practice of the Chriſtian
Church for Fifteen Hundred years, and upwards,
hath flatly contradicted. And whether the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a few, and thoſe (it may be) for the moſt
part Ignorant; or the Opinions of Thouſands,
who (for their great Piety and exemplary Loyalty)
are of precious Memory; be in a Caſe of ſo great
moment as this, to be preferred, he muſt have
abjured his Reaſon, that cannot eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</p>
            <p>However it be, we need go no further to learn
Loyalty, than our own Church. All the Laws of
this Realm, both Sacred, and Civil, do teach us
what it is. The Oath of <hi>Fidelity,</hi> (which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
moſt Men have taken, is ſufficiently plain,
and obligatory; to which I remit you. And let
any Man conſult that, together with his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and Safety, and then let him be Diſloyal, if
he can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither did any of the Ancient Fathers recede
one jot from the Apoſtolical Doctrine, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi>
It is the greateſt wickedneſs in the World,
to reſiſt the Supream Power, <hi>ſaith</hi> Clemens <hi>in his

are Injurions to Majeſty, yet can you find no ſuch
Man amongſt us; for tho we have filled not only
the Country, but the Court, yet are we averſe to
Rebellion. Our Saviour hath taught us, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48578:9"/>

Julian) <note place="margin">Nazianz. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. 1. adverſus</hi> Julian.</note>not to reſiſt Lawful Authority, (<hi>meaning
the Emperour,</hi>) but rather to ſuffer; it is lawful
for us to flee, our Saviour hath permitted it, ſo
did St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> ſo did St. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> neither
have we any other Remedy left us, but Prayers
and Tears. <hi>And when an Emperour offered Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

your Tears; with theſe you may, but with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you may not reſist.</p>
            <p>And that which will be the glory of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World, to the end of the World, as it will
likewiſe be the ſhame of thoſe that contrived, and
acted that Tragedy, an-indelible Example of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Patience, is that of the <hi>Theban</hi> Legion;
which conſiſted of near Seven Thouſand Chriſtian
Souldiers, who being in the Field, and having
their Swords drawn in their hands, and of ſufficient
Power to defend themſelves, and rout the Forces
of the Emperour; yet ſuffered themſelves quietly
and calmly to be Martyred, rather than to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the ſevere and unmanly Edict of <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might give Examples in every Century down
to theſe very Times, and I might have done it
without going far from home. It is not long ſince
the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> was Martyred in
the Cauſe of her Sovereign Lord. Let thoſe who
were the Deſigners, and the Actors of that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evangelical
Zeal, live unparallel'd, and die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitied!
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48578:10"/>
But I ſhall content my ſelf, and (I hope)
ſatisfie every Honeſt man, and modeſt Chriſtian,
with that which St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> hath ſaid upon the
words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>Wherefore ye muſt
needs be ſubject, whoſoever ye be, tho an Apoſtle,
Evangeliſt, Prophet, or whoever elſe, you muſt
needs be ſubject; for, if Chriſt and his Apoſtles</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>thought it requiſite to be ſubject to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
how much more requiſite then muſt it needs
be, to be ſubject to Chriſtian Princes.?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the Fathers, I promiſed you the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Immortal <hi>Grotius,</hi> who hath been
miſerably miſunderſtood by ſome in this Point:
no man ever yet having aſſerted, and defended the
Prerogatives of Kings, with ſuch ſtrength of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
ſuch ſober, ſolid, and ſubſtantial Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as that Learned Man hath done. And his
Obſervation (amongſt many others of great worth)
is this;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grot.</hi> de jur.</note> 
               <q>That the Goſpel is a more exact Rule,
and a more pure Inſtitution than ever yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the World,<note place="margin">Belli, &amp;c. lib. 1. cb. 4. fuſiſſimè; &amp; in Annotat.</note> and conſequently doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a more perfect and intire Patience,<note place="margin">Sacris paſſim.</note> and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
and therefore we cannot without great
Sin, and the higheſt Injury to our Bleſſed Lord,
and his Goſpel, recede from that exact Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which he hath enjoyned, and whereof he
hath made himſelf our Example. And how he
behaved himſelf, the Apoſtle is the moſt credible
witneſs, who telleth us, that <note place="margin">1 pet. 2. 21, 22, 23.</note>
                  <hi>he did no Sin, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was Guile found in his mouth; that when
he was reviled, he reviled not again; that
when he ſuffered he threatned not, but committed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48578:10"/>
himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly, in all
things leaving us his Example, that we ſhould
tread in his steps.</hi>
               </q> Thus <hi>Grotius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Goſpel, and the
Laws and Practice of all Chriſtian Nations; ſo the
Law of Nature, and all Civilized (tho not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian)
Nations, do aſſert this Truth: whereof
<hi>Plato</hi>'s Books of his Common Wealth are an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Teſtimony. And in the Twelve Tables (which
are believed to be of <hi>Grecian</hi> extract, <hi>Greece</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
furniſhed all the Heathen World with Laws,
as it is probably ſuppoſed,) which contain the
Fundamentals of the Old <hi>Roman</hi> Law, <hi>Crimen lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae
Majeſtatis</hi> is the firſt, as being a guilt of the
higheſt nature.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have ſeen what Primitive Cuſtom
hath for this Aſſertion. It appears by what hath
been ſpoken, that we muſt be ſo far from queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Royal Prerogatives, that we are obliged
both by the Law of God, Nature, and all Nations,
to vindicate them though it be with peril of life.
And if our Superiours ſhould Command us any
thing (as God forbid they ſhould) contrary to any
of theſe Laws, you hear what is enjoyned us; We
muſt lay our hands upon our Mouths, and ſuffer
with that Meekneſs which becometh our Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
remembring the Examples of our Saviour and
the Primitive Chriſtians, whereof I have given
you a full (and I hope ſatisfactory) account.
However, I am aſſured that I have ſpoken the
Judgment of the beſt, and pureſt Ages of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48578:11"/>
neither can any thing be ſound in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to this Doctrine in all the whole Life, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or Sufferings of Chriſt; nor in the conſtant
and unerring Practice of the Primitive Chriſtians;
nor in any of the Writings of the Apoſtles, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick
Men. I proceed therefore to ſhew,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That for Subjects to question the Actions
(tho offenſive) or Authority of their Princes, is
inconſistent with the nature of the Kingly Office.</hi>
The Scepter is put into their hands by God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
alone: and with that the Power he giveth
them is ſo great, as that he maketh them capable
of being accountable to none, but Himſelf only;
Thus he ſaith, <hi>By me Kings Reign.</hi> Of this
Power King <hi>Solomons</hi> Sentence is very abſolute,
<hi>Who ſhall ſay to a King, what doſt thou?</hi> and of the
unqueſtionableneſs, and uncontroulableneſs of his
Authority, he further addeth, <hi>The wrath of a
King is as the roaring of a Lion; who ſhall ſtir
him up?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things depending on another, are governed by
that on which they depend: this is undeniable.
Thus the Lives, and Liberties of Subjects, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the good, or evil Will of their Prince.
And thus much <hi>Pilate</hi> could alledge to our Bleſſed
Saviour, that <hi>he had power to condemn him,</hi> and
that <hi>he had power to releaſe him;</hi> whereupon our
Saviour replied, without any denial, or refuſal of
the Power, that <hi>he had no power at all, but what
was given him from above;</hi> that is, that Power
wherewith he was inveſted, and which he then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed,
under the Roman <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was not only by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48578:11"/>
the permiſſion, but alſo by the Order, and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God.</p>
            <p>Were it ſo, that the Actions of Kings, or their
Authority, could be ſwayed, or byaſſed, by any
other Terreſtrial Power whatſoever, except their
own: how <hi>Proteus</hi>-like would Government be?
How would the Laws of Mercy, and Juſtice, which
are ſo eſſential to the Being of a Government,
that it cannot ſubſiſt without them, be either
wreſted, or quite antiquated, by the Prevalency of
a Party? Admit but this, and then we ſhould ſoon
be ſenſible of the Prophets complaint, <hi>Juſtice is
gone away backward;</hi> having inſtead of Law,
Rule, and Order, nothing but Noiſe, Diſtraction,
and Confuſion. Which brings me to ſhew.</p>
            <p>3. That for Subjects to queſtion the Actions, or
Authority of their Prince, is diametrally oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the Liberty of the Subject. <hi>We are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
unto lawful Earthly Powers,</hi> That under
them we may lead godly, and peaceable lives,
<hi>ſaith the Great Apoſtle. And that (according to
the Prophet</hi>) Every man might fit under his own
Vine, and that none might make him afraid. <hi>The
enjoyment of our Lives, and our Liberties too, as
well in Sacred, as Secular things, next under God,
we have from the Prudence of our Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That our Lives have not hitherto been made a
Prey to our Enemies, it is, becauſe his Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
maintaineth, and defendeth them. That our
Liberties, both in Religion, and State, have not
long ſince periſhed away in our boſoms, it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we have a King to actuate, and enliven them.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48578:12"/>
In a word, That the Allies of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi>
have not long ere this extirpated the beſt Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Church in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Church of <hi>England;</hi> it
is, becauſe his Sacred Majeſty, and his Predeceſſors,
(and long may He, and His Succeſſors be equally
proſperous,) have hitherto diſpelled all thoſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Miſts, of <hi>Schiſm, Sacriledge,</hi> and <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
which they raiſed amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have ſhewed you, That a KING
is the Greateſt of all Earthly Bleſſings, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of our Lives, the Bulwark of our Liberties.
Surely I need not long ſtand to recommend it to
you. How many Hundreds yet alive, have not
long ſince ſeen our tumultuous World; wherein
tho Religion, and Liberty were the Pretence, yet
Prophanity, Atheiſm, and Slavery were the Event?
Wherein our greateſt Enjoyment was the bleſſed
Hotchpotch of Democracy: and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of our
Devotion (inſtead of our pure, and Primitive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy)
was exerciſed in an halting Directory, not
only deſtructive of, and contradictory to, all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
but alſo to it Self. And the wholſom Laws
of our Gracious and Natural Sovereign, abrogated
together with Himſelf, to make way for worſe.
And that which Crown'd the Happineſs, we had
<hi>Reformation</hi> thrown amongſt us with a Sword in
its hand, to let us ſee how baſely we had abuſed
the Power of the Sword, in taking it from him,
who alone (by the Law of God, Nature, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,)
did juſtly challenge it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48578:12"/>
The abrogation of Civil Power makes every
Man <hi>Sui juris:</hi> ſo that take away the Supreme
Power, which is indeed the Life of all Laws, and
then all manner of Sins will be venial. Hereſie
and Schiſm, Murder, Conſpiracy and Rebellion,
the blackeſt Impieties, theſe will never be boggled
at. For indeed, that many Men abſtain from the
Commiſſion of theſe Sins, it is not becauſe they
are ſo much afraid of the Juſtice of God; as of the
Severity of the King, who ſwayeth the Sword of
<hi>Juſtice,</hi> as Gods only Vicegerent. And thus, at
the long run, ſhould we be brought into the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
condition of the wretched <hi>Hebrews,</hi> of whom
we find this Melancholy Complaint regiſtred by
the Prophet no leſs than four times together: that
<note place="margin">Judg. 17. 6. &amp; 18. 1. &amp; 19. 1. &amp; 21. ult.</note>
               <hi>in thoſe days there was no King in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but every
Man did that which was right in his own Eyes.</hi>
Which ſeaſonably brings me to my Third Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
namely to ſhew,</p>
            <p>3. <hi>That ſuch are the Impetuoſities of the Vulgar,
that notwithſtanding this Sacred Reſerve, Majeſty
it ſelf can ſcarce any where be inviolable.</hi> Altho
God Almighty hath made ſo good ſecurity for his
Anointed; tho their Crowns be eſtabliſhed by the
firm and perpetual Decrees of all Laws, both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Humane: yet there are a ſort of Men in
the World, and the very Peſt they are of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Society, the great Principles of whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
are to vilifie and blaſpheme Magiſtracy, and
to trample upon and contemn all that is Sacred and
Venerable; purchaſing to themſelves the Applauſe
of the Popularity by wild <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> Notions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48578:13"/>
they do eaſily prevail upon, and ſeduce the
giddy Multitude.</p>
            <p>And there is nothing vented, tho never ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
and phrenetical, but ſome will counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
it. The moſt Lunatic Fancies being once
broached, do not long want Abettors. And hence
there are ſeveral Objections raiſed, to ſtrengthen
this Antimonarchical Fabrick.</p>
            <p>1. They object, <hi>Regem eſſe infra non ſupra
Eccleſiam.</hi> This Objection is equally aſſerted,
both by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> and Reformed Party: the one
endeavouring hereby to magnifie the Power of him
who treadeth upon the Necks of Kings, tho he
was anciently wont, and ſtill his Duty is the ſame,
to embrace their Feet: the other hereby ſtriving
to vindicate the Supream Power of <hi>Claſſes</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</hi>
And the Anſwer of the one, will be the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
conviction of either.</p>
            <p>But firſt, it will be neceſſary to ask, Whether by
the Church, they mean the <hi>Catholic,</hi> or ſome part
of it only?</p>
            <p>If they mean the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> then we
muſt needs confeſs, that no King is above, but
within it: ſeeing it never yet was, nor never can
be under the Power of any Earthly Monarch.
When they have ſaid what they can for the Popes
Supremacy, we believe, that the <hi>Catholic Church</hi>
oweth Fealty to none, but only to Him who right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Neither can it be ſuppoſed to
have any Viſible Head, except in a Council truly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48578:13"/>
General, and that Headſhip can only remain <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tempore
Concilii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if by the word <hi>Church</hi> be meant any part
only of the Catholic, as in particular the Church
of <hi>England:</hi> then we own no Head but the <hi>King</hi>
alone; and ſo here will be no work for the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent
and his Claſſis. And if they demand
our Reaſon, for this we remit them to the Canons
of our Church, which tell us, <hi>That the Kings of</hi>
England <hi>claim no more Power in Eccleſiaſtical
Matters, than the Pious Kings of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the
Religious Chriſtian Princes</hi> (even the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
for ſome of the firſt Centuries) <hi>anciently
had.</hi> And till they can ſhew us a more warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Pattern, than the univerſal Chriſtian Practice
of Fifteen Hundred years, and more; they muſt
give us leave to proſecute our Allegiance. Taking
this Firſt for granted, they proceed without our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
or ſhew of Reaſon.</p>
            <p>2. To ſay, that a King muſt <hi>Servire Eccleſiae;</hi>
which Phraſe ſeveral Ancient and Pious Authors
have uſed, and to which we aſſent, if we may have
leave to underſtand it as the Ancients did. But if
they go about by this Phraſe, to ſubject a King to
the ſlaviſh humors of his People, we muſt take
leave to diſſent, <hi>Servire Eccleſiae,</hi> according to the
mind of ſuch Authors as uſe it, is no more than
<hi>Neceſſitatibus Eccleſiae conſulere,</hi> and in this ſence
the greateſt Monarch will not refuſe it: this is all
that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> meaneth by it; witneſs himſelf,
<hi>Serviunt enim qui imperant, officio conſulendi, &amp;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48578:14"/>
providendi Miſericordia.</hi> This is all that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Authors mean, when they render <hi>Imperium,
Servitutem.</hi> Thus therefore, if they will allow
us to interpret we are agreed: but if they will
not, we muſt needs ſay, they are very bad Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologiſts,
in ſtriving to frame ſuch <hi>Sences,</hi> with
which Antiquity is utterly unacquainted.</p>
            <p>3. They allow a Power, (if the King do not in
their ſence, <hi>Servire Eccleſiae</hi>) to Subordinate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
to correct the Miſcarriages of Princes.
A moſt unjuſt and unequal Priviledge! What is
meant by Subordinate Magiſtrates, we ſuppoſe to be
ſuch Perſons as have received Authority from the
King; let them act in what capacity ſoever, either
in Church, or State. And theſe Inferiour Powers
are approved of God:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13, 14, 15.</note> yet ſo, as the Apoſtle ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to make our <hi>Obedience</hi> to the King, and thoſe
Inferiour Powers, two different things; to the
King we are ſo far enjoyned Obedience, that we
cannot poſſibly fail in it, without being abſolutely
guilty of Sin; to the Inferiour Magiſtrate, we are
obliged, ſo far as his Commands are the ſame with
the Kings, or not deſtructive of, or prejudicial to
them; which if they be, the ſame Obligation is
upon us not to obey, but to appeal to the Greater,
<hi>viz.</hi> the King.</p>
            <p>It is beyond all Controverſie with me, and I
hope with all good Men; that tho Inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
with reſpect to Private Perſons, be Publick,
yet with reſpect to the King they are Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
And as it is in the Power of Inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48578:14"/>
to take cognizance of, and puniſh the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
of Private Perſons, ſo doubtleſs is it in the
Power of the King, to take cognizance of, and
puniſh the Offences of Inferiour Magiſtrates; with
reſpect to whom, they are no more than Private
Perſons, (as I have already ſhewed,) and ſo liable
to be by him puniſhed, for their Miſcarriages, as
Private. <note place="margin">For further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>faction in this point of the Authority of Supreme, and Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; I ſhall refer the more Curious, to mine Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the <hi>Church-Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> (in the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,) now under the hands of the <hi>Amanuenſis;</hi> and will (<hi>Bono cum Deo</hi>) be ere long ready for the Preſs.</note>It would certainly be no ſmall Paradox,
to ſay, That the King, having the Supream Power
in theſe Kingdoms, (and long may He, and His
Lawful Succeſſors, enjoy and exerciſe it,) might
not inveſt ſuch Perſons as he ſhould think fit, with
Inferiour Magiſtracy, and puniſh them for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe,
or Neglect of the Exerciſe of the Power he
hath given them; or degrade, and deveſt them of
their Authority.</p>
            <p>4. If the Inferiour Magiſtrates be Negligent,
then the Paſtors, and People, have ſolemn leave to
Depoſe (nay Martyr) Kings, to defend themſelves
(in ſuch Unchriſtian Actions) with the Power of
the Sword, if their Lives and Conſciences (as they
do moſt prepoſterouſly term it) cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſafe from the Tyranny of Kings. A moſt
Antichriſtian Principle, and ſuch as might defile the
very mouth of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> to pronounce it! <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſco
referens.</hi> This, and much more ſuch horrid
Stuff, may be found in the Commentaries of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,</hi>
upon the <hi>13th</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
Neither could it ever have been better confuted,
than it was by King <hi>JAMES</hi> of Bleſſed Memory,
and the Loyal Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who gave
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48578:15"/>
Order, That the Commentaries of <hi>Pareus</hi> ſhould
be hurnt (as they well deſerved) in Public, by the
hands of the Common Hangman. And for the
utter extirpation of ſuch Seditious, Impious, and
Antimonarchical Doctrines, it was decreed by the
<hi>Oxonian</hi> Univerſity, in a full Convocation, <hi>June</hi>
the <hi>5th, 1622. That every Perſon that was to be
honoured with a Degree, in any Faculty what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
ſhould before Admiſſion Swear,</hi> (in an Oath
framed for that very purpoſe) <hi>to alienate ſuch
Principles:</hi> As may be ſeen at large in the Decree,
and Oath.</p>
            <p>5. According to theſe Infernal Principles (in the
late Times of Diſtraction) this was uſually their
(moſt Illogical) Aſſertion; <hi>That it was lawful to
fight against the Kings Perſon, with his Power;
and that the King might be killed in his Perſonal,
or Private Capacity,</hi> (as they called it,) <hi>and yet his
Power never the worſe for it, his Authority not
ſuffering.</hi> A ſtrange Metaphyſical Notion! And
ſo likewiſe, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of Kings, <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Kingly Office, not his Perſon; with much
more of this Nature. Thus do they make the
King a meer <hi>Platonical</hi> Idea, a Quality, not a
Perſonal Subſiſtence: As if the King of <hi>England</hi>
were nothing but <hi>CAROL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S REX</hi> written
in Court-hand, without either Fleſh or Blood. If
it be ſo, to what purpoſe are thoſe ſignificant So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
uſed at the Coronations? Why are they
Crown'd, Inthroned, Inoyled? but to ſhew their
Perſonal, and Imperial Power and Supremacy: in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48578:15"/>
Military, Judiciary, and Religious Matters. That
the Kings Authority may be where his Perſon is
not (if this be their meaning) is moſt true; but,
that his Perſon may be where his Authority is not,
is moſt falſe: And a King without Perſonal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
is a Contradiction, and no King. How dull
were the Primitive Chriſtians, that could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
themſelves of this Diſtinction! what Blood
and Martyrdom might it have ſaved? But let theſe
faint Chimera's vaniſh.</p>
            <p>6. They ſay, that <hi>if we aſcribe ſo much Power
to the King, Religion cannot be ſafe, but that he
may alter it at his Pleaſure.</hi> And ſo He may:
Neither is the Power of Kings in any thing more
viſible, than in eſtabliſhing ſuch Modes of Public
Worſhip, as they think fit. This is ſufficiently
aſſerted, and maintained by the moſt Political Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
that hitherto I have met withal. Were not
the Religious Rites in <hi>Judea</hi> altered, according to
the Genius of the Prince? Thus we find the Rites
of <hi>Ahaz</hi> altered by his Son <hi>Ezechias,</hi> which
<hi>Manaſſes</hi> his Nephew again reſtored, but by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi>
they were again aboliſhed. Thus, if they
demand, why in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
the Reformed Religion, prevailed? there can
be no other Reaſon be given, but that (next under
God) it was <hi>Ex Reginarum Arbitrio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an Old (and unanſwerable) Maxim, <hi>Qualis
Rex, Talis Lex.</hi> And if every Magiſtrate muſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48578:16"/>
be deveſted of his Power, becauſe it is poſſible He
may abuſe it, then ſhould we have no Power at
all, at leaſt no Exerciſe of Power, there being the
ſame Reaſon to fear every Man alike, becauſe the
Axiom (<hi>Nemo est qui falli neque at</hi>) includeth all.
But why our King may not be intruſted with the
ſame Power (ſeeing he cannot well uſe it worſe)
wherewith they durſt intruſt their Protector, is a
Paradox to me.</p>
            <p>Or, ſuppoſe this ſhould fall out (which always
doth not) that a King ſhould alter the received Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
yet may we have ſufficient comfort, if we
conſider, that <hi>the Hearts of all Men are in the
hand of the Lord,</hi> but more eſpecially are the
<note place="margin">Prov. 21. 1.</note>
               <hi>Hearts of Kings in his Power, and as the Rivers
of water, he can turn them as he pleaſeth.</hi> It is
Gods work (you hear) to ſway the Inclinations of
Kings, let us then beware how we meddle in it.
His Power is ſo unſpeakable, that he can equally
effect his Will, as well by Evil, as by Good
Kings.</p>
            <p>Sometimes <hi>Proſperity,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi>
is more profitable for the Church. And if the
Prince be Pious, then the Truth flouriſheth under
him: and if he be Ungodly, it will be Evil for the
Church, but worſe for him, whoſe Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhall One day be augmented, anſwerably to
the greatneſs of his Charge. And in the mean
time, <hi>Rebellion</hi> will be ſo far from being agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that it will every way be contradictory to a
Chriſtian Profeſſion. Well ſaid Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48578:16"/>
               <note place="margin">

ita &amp; legibus malis probantur boni, &amp; legibus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
emendantur mali.</hi> But I haſt to my Fourth
and Laſt Propoſition, namely,</p>
            <p>4. <hi>That ſince the Perſons, and Powers of
KINGS are eſteemed Sacred, both by the Laws
of God, Nature, and all Nations; to exhort all
Men, that they be to the utmoſt of their Power
careful not to violate ſo great a Priviledge.</hi> The
Duty of Obedience to Kings, was a thing ſo well
known, and ſo firmly believed in the Primitive
Times, that the Chriſtians then ſtood in need of
no other Arguments to perſwade them to it, but
ſuch as Chriſt and his Apoſtles left upon Record.
And ſeeing that thoſe who lived ſo near the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
Days, were ſo extraordinarily tenacious of this
Duty: it raiſeth Admiration in me, to conſider,
That ſome Men amongſt us, who do (at leaſt)
pretend to as great Sanctity as ever any Primitive.
Chriſtian had, ſhould go about to raiſe Arguments,
to defend their Taking up of Arms againſt their
Lawful (and Chriſtian) Princes, from the ſame
Sacred Scriptures, which the Ancients thought
laid ſufficient Obligation upon them (as I have
largely ſhewed in the preceding Parts of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe)
to obey even the worſt of Heathen Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48578:17"/>
That both God, Nature, and Nations, have pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged
Kings, I have already fully ſhewed, and
I truſt ſo fully, as to render it (however to all
good Men) indubitable; the Authorities that I
have made uſe of, are ſuch as are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable.
For next to the Sacred Scriptures,
which we all equally own, and adhere unto, I have
urged only ſuch General Councils, and Ancient Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
as have hitherto been approved by the whole
Chriſtian World. And for the Teſtimonies of the
Fathers, or Others that I have uſed, they are
from the beſt and moſt Authentic Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>However therefore this Diſcourſe may reliſh, it
concerneth not me; ſeeing that I am aſſured, that
I have all along Impartially ſpoken the Mind of
the <hi>Catholic Church.</hi> And that to this very day,
there hath not been a General Council, truly ſo
named; or any other Ancient (tho not Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical)
Synod, duly, and regularly called, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating;
or an Authentic Copy of any Father;
that have delivered otherwiſe. If our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
can produce the contrary, we challenge them
in the Name of God to do it: if they cannot (which
is I am certain much more eaſie,) then let their
Brainſick Notions ceaſe to be impoſed upon the
Vulgar Multitude; who are more apt to be taken
with Flatteries of their Chimerical Greatneſs, and
Supremacy; with Noiſe, and Impudence; than
with any ſober Reaſon, or ſound Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48578:17"/>
But let Us, who have ſo good Authority for our
Warrant, as the Voice, and Univerſal Practice of
the Primitive Church, reſolve (in ſpight of all
Contradiction) to be ever Conſcious of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Methinks, the very conſideration of our Intereſt,
and Society, ſhould put us in mind of Subjection:
for what a Polity elſe ſhould we make? what great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Soloeciſm could we grant in Nature, than that
the Head ſhould give place to the Supremacy of the
Foot? Tho it be true (as the Apoſtle obſerveth)
that in the Body, no one Member can be without
antoher; yet for the Inferiour to go about to uſurp
the Office, and Power of the Superiour, muſt needs
make a Privation, and ſo leave ſome place unfilled;
to which Philoſophy will in no wiſe yield. There
are not the moſt uncivilized of all People, but they
have ſomething of Subordination: how much more
then ought we to do that, which not only Nature,
but God, and the Law of Nations, have enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>And if our Intereſt cannot draw us, let the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of our Saviour, and the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
perſuade us; And if theſe be not ſufficient to
ſway us, let the Eternal Rewards of Grace entice
us; nay, ſince God Almighty hath made ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Defences for Kings, let the Majeſty of their
Countenances daſh our daring Fancies into due Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
and Subjection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48578:18"/>
A good Chriſtian, and a good Subject, are Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procals;
the one being not poſſible to be found
without the other. And if we have love for our
great Maſter, we can no way better manifeſt it,
than by yielding a full Subjection to ſuch Powers
as he hath ordained to fill his Room, till Himſelf
come, whoſe all <hi>Power</hi> truly is, and to whom all
<hi>Authority</hi> doth rightly belong.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore ſtrive by Obedience to our
Prince, to regain that Honour and Credit, which
our Nation by Diſobedience hath ſo lately loſt.
We may juſtly ſay, That (with our Royal Prophet)
<hi>we are become the very Scorn and Deriſion of them
that are round about us;</hi> but let us beſeech God
(with our Royal <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Martyr) not
to lay that Innocent Blood unto our charge. And
for the future, let us be active in repairing thoſe
Breaches of Loyalty, which the Father moſt right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
claimed, for the Son. And let us not ſuffer our
ſelves any more to be deluded, with the Vanities
of thoſe Men, who (under the empty Notions, and
ſpecious Titles of Chriſts Kingdom, Liberty, and
Reformation,) Preached up nothing amongſt us,
but Hypocriſie, Rebellion, and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Let theſe miſerable Calamities, under
which we ſo lately groaned, be a further Incentive
of Loyalty to us. Let us think of them, and I
queſtion not, they will be a means to make us Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve,
to ſtand by our Prince with our Lives and
our Fortunes. And to animate us in ſo indiſpenſible
a Duty, let us beg of God to continue us in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48578:18"/>
True Religion, which at this Day by Law we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs;
and then we need not to queſtion, but the
ſence of our Duty, will add ſtrength and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
to our Loyalty. <hi>Which</hi> (that it may do)
<hi>God of his great Mercy grant for Jeſus Chriſt's
ſake: To whom with Thee, O Father, and Thee, O
Bleſſed Spirit; Three Perſons, but One Immutable
GOD, be given of the Holy Catholic Church, all
Power, Praiſe, and Glory, World without End,</hi>
Amen, Amen.</p>
