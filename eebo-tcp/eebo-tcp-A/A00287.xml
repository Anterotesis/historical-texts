            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The Lady <hi>St. Iohn</hi> who hitherto had liued in good amitie with her husband, through ill counſell now leaueth his houſe and company, and being
put in hope to obtain both this 10000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> mariage portion and this ioynture of 1200 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> a yeare, ſhe firſt by a petition to his Maieſtie procureth theſe pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the Marquis to be inhibited, and then <hi>viz.</hi> 12. Febr. 1616. exhibiteth a Bill in Chancery againſt Sir <hi>Francis Englefield</hi> in the name of her ſelfe
and her husband, pretending that the intereſt of this 10000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> mariage portion did then reſt in her husband, with whom ſhe ſaith ſhe had made an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               </abbr> thereof for her ſuſtentation and maintenance, which with damages for detaining the ſame from her, ſhe requireth of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.
In Eaſter Terme 1617. the Lo. <hi>St. Iohn</hi> hauing notice of this his wifes fraudulent bill exhibited in his name without his priuitie; and conceiuing
the ſame to be done purpoſely to wrong his father and himſelfe, he therefore 12. May. 1617. by his counſell in the open Court of Chancery diſclaimeth
this his wifes bill, and denieth to haue made with her any agreement whereby ſhe might challenge any part of this mariage portion; notwithſtanding
which diſclaime reſting vpon record, ſhe procureth this 9000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> for her ſuſtentation and maintenance, together with 2500 <abbr>

vnto her, which Sir <hi>Fra. Englefield</hi> knowing not to be warranted by the truſt, refuſed to pay, and was for the ſame committed to the priſon of the
Fleete, from whence he could not be diſcharged vntill after nine moneths impriſonment he had paid to the ſaid Ladie <hi>St. Iohn</hi> all the moneys then in
his hands, by reaſon of this truſt being 10000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr>.</p>
            <p>Vpon this fraudulent and diſclaimed Bill many orders haue been made, amongſt which 11. Iun. 1618. it was vpon this Ladies motion ordered, that
if Sir <hi>Fra. Englefield</hi> ſhould not forthwith account for theſe truſt moneys, and aſſigne ouer the ſaid truſts to Sir <hi>George Moore,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn VValter,</hi> and M. <hi>Tho.
Spencer,</hi> he ſhould againe be committed, and a Fine of 500 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> is ſet on his head; which Sir <hi>Fra. Englefield</hi> conceiuing to be no breach of the truſt, he
therefore by his petition reſting vpon Record, proffered the ſame, &amp; tendred performance thereof accordingly, as ſhall appeare teſtified vnder the hands
of the Lord Chancellour himſelfe and two of the Maſters of the Court; yet as if he had refuſed to aſſigne or account, is he againe vpon this order (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any warrant for his commitment) violently drawne to the priſon of the Fleet, where he continued full 21 months more; and the ſaid Lady <hi>St Iohn</hi>
hauing by meanes of falſe ſuggeſtions made to his Maieſtie, procured a grant of this 500 <abbr>

contrary to law for this 500 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr>, which forthwith is leuied out of his goods and paid vnto her.</p>
            <p>The lands ſubiect to this truſt being by the ſtrongeſt aſſurance of the Law ſo conueyed to theſe three Feoffees, and no power thereby left in the
Viſcount to ſtir or alter the ſame, neuertheleſſe in May 1615. he exhibiteth a bill in Chancery againſt the ſaid Feoffees, pretending thereby that they
had broken this truſt, as alſo that they deſired to be disburdened from the ſame, and therefore praid that by the authoritie of the Court they might be
enioyned to aſſigne this truſt to ſuch other new Feoffees as he ſhould nominate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In anſwer to which bill, the Defendants doe on their oath denie to
haue broken or neglected this truſt, or that euer they deſired to be freed from the ſame; it was neuertheleſſe 16. Iuly. 1617. vpon the Viſcounts motion
(without proofe of witneſſe or hearing the Defendants counſell) ordered, that the poſſeſſion of theſe lands ſhall be taken from the Defendants and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
to Sir <hi>Geo. Moore,</hi> Sir <hi>Io. VValter,</hi> and M. <hi>Tho. Spencer,</hi> whom the Viſcount did then nominate as new Feoffees to execute this truſt, vnto whom
likewiſe he procureth by a writ dated the 18 of Iuly, and directed to the Shiriffe of Suſſex the poſſeſſion of the ſaid lands truſted to be deliuered, and

of which orders the Lady <hi>St. Iohn</hi> perceiuing her father and his aforeſaid new Feoffees to conuert the whole profits of the lands truſted to their owne
priuate, ſhe threatneth to complaine of the wrong done her; her father therefore to giue her ſatisfaction proffereth her 600 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> a yeare out of the ſame
vntill her mony were paid, which ſhe the better to be aſſured of to receiue, procureth to be ordered vnto her by the Court.</p>

but in part of her ſatisfaction; ſo he and his new Feoffees might enioy the reſidue and not be queſtioned for the meane profits of the ſaid lands which
ſo vniuſtly they had detained, and this truſt might be deſtroyed: which proffer the Lady <hi>St Iohns</hi> accepting, it is reſolued a decree muſt be gotten to
inforce Sir <hi>Francis Englefield</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Dormer</hi> thereunto, in whom the ſole intereſt of the ſaid lands after the death of the Lord <hi>Dormer</hi> did reſt; but
how to procure this decree to deſtroy this truſt (which the Vicount by his bill ſeemed deſirous ſhould ſubſiſt) and to croſſe not onely the Viſcounts bill
vpon which it was made, but the aforeſaid decree made vpon the Lady <hi>St Iohns</hi> bill and all former orders and proceedings in Court vpon theſe bils,
was holden a matter impoſſible to procure; neuertheleſſe by the meanes of great bribes giuen and more promiſed by the Viſcount (which bribes are
confeſſed in Parliament) this Decree is made, bearing date the 23 of Iune 1618.</p>
            <p>The Lord Chancellor who made this Decree, well knowing the ſame by the ancient practiſe of the Court (as hauing no ground) to be voide in it
ſelfe, would therefore (notwithſtanding the aforeſaid bribes) ſo long as he ſate (which was neare three yeares after) neuer ſuffer any execution of this
Decree, yet to giue the Vicount ſome content, it was vpon his motion made the 20 of May 1620. ordered, that if Sir <hi>Francis Englefield</hi> did not by the
