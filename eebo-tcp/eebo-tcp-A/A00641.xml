            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="2">2. THe firſt beginning of playes proceeded <note place="margin">Heathen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented playes.</note> from thoſe men which were not in the Church of God. When God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man to get his liuing, with his labour Gen. 3. 19. Iuball the ſeauenth of Cain his race invented playing. Gen. 4. 21. on Inſtruments, which (as after) is a lawfull recreation. But the invention of divers ſorts of vnlawfull playes is briefly noted by Plinius Hiſtor. natur. lib. 7. cap. 59. by Euſebius de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. euang. lib. 1. cap. 2. and lib. 2. cap. 2. by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius contra gentes lib. 7. by Polydorus Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius de rerum invent. lib. 3. cap. 13. by Alexander ab Alexandro genialium dierum. libr. 6. cap. 19. by Caelius Rhodiginus antiq. lib. 8. cap. 7.

About the beginning of the Perſian monarchie, which <note place="margin">The ſolemn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of playes.</note> was almoſt 500 yeeres afore Chriſt, and about the time of the Iewes returne out of the captivitie of Babylon, this miſcreant author alwayes of ſome hurte, never of any good to Chriſtian or heathen, firſt came abroade with great ſolemnitie, as it may be gathered by Herodotus. Afterwards from thoſe Lydians in Aſia, or from the Grecians at Athens, came playes to Rome in the reigne of Tarquinius Priſcus, as Euſebius noteth in his Chronologie at the yeare of the world 4602.

               <p>The firſt authoriſed entrance that any ſuch kinde <note place="margin">The entrance of playes into the Church of the Iewes.</note> of playes or heathen exerciſe had into the church of God, ſeemeth to be about 170 yeares before the birth of Chriſt, when that wicked Ieſus affecting heatheniſme, changed his name into Iaſon, and for 150 talents of ſilver purchaſed a commiſſion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes king of Syria, that he might erect a place for heathen exerciſes at Ieruſalem, and traine up the youth of the Iewes in the cuſtomes of the Gentiles, 1 Maccab. 1. 12. Ioſeph. antiq. lib. 12. cap. 6. but more ſpecially 2 Maccab. 4. 7. &amp;c. Which exerciſe though it was not to play on the ſtage, but for activitie of their bodies, yet it may
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14090:5"/>
here be obſerved as an entrance to other heathen cuſtomes, and as that which maketh way to bring in Stage-playes afterwards. Then Herode the greate increaſed heatheniſh playes and exerciſes greatly in his dayes, building one theater at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; Ioſeph. antiq. lib. 15. cap. 10. or 11. and an other at Caeſarea Stratonis; Ioſeph. antiq. lib. 15. cap. 13. and lib. 16. cap. 9. The horrible ſinnes of the Iewes cutte them off ſhortly after from being the Church of God, and therefore no more can be ſayd of their heatheniſh exerciſes.</p>
               <p>How or when Playes came into the Chriſtian Church, and who firſt gaue them intertainment, <note place="margin">Their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the christian church.</note> is more incident to this preſent purpoſe, and fitter teſtimonie to giue evidence hereafter either for them or againſt them. When the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours delighted too much in all kind of playes, and when chriſtian religion grew mightily under them in Europe eſpecially, chriſtians imbraceing the Goſpel could not be altogether ignorant of theſe ſtage-playes, but ſometimes ſome chriſtians reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to theſe playes, as by the complaints and invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of ſome ancient fathers againſt them, it doth appeare. And though ſecretly by ſuch meanes playes through ſatans ſubtilties approached neare to the church doore, yet all this while neither the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours power thruſt them upon the Church, nor the reverend Fathers and faithfull Paſtours of thoſe times gaue way to ſuch open wickednes by theire ſilence. But when that great ſcarlet coloured whore of Babylon with her golden cup of abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in her hand, which hath a name written in her forehead, a myſterie, great Babilon the mother
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14090:5"/>
of whoredomes, and which reigneth over the kings of the earth, was ſet in Peters chaire at Rome as the Papiſts ſay; then did the king of the Locuſts, called <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Apollyon,</hi> hauing the key of the bottomeles pitt, with full power for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſette the church doore wide open for ſundrie ſportes and playes to enter freely into the houſe of God, as Platina reporteth Paulus II. did. And that not onely in their great ſolemnities and feſtivals, which were ſpent commonly in bellie cheare and Playes, as Peucerus writeth of Vrbanus IIII. much after the faſhion of the Iſraelites, ſitting downe to eate and drinke, and riſing up to play: but ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their rich Iubilies, firſt begunne in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian church by Bonifacius VIII. in the yeare of Chriſt 1300. and afterwards continued and haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his ſucceſſors. Of which Sports and Playes Aventinus annal. Bojor. lib. 7. ſpeaking of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens VI. and Bale in the life of Iulius III. doe write. And thus much ſhall ſuffice for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Playes among the Lydians of Aſia; and among the Grecians and Romans in Europe; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for their entrance into the Chriſtian church, firſt ſecretly by the malice of Satan ſtealing ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians affections to ſuch vanities; then openly by the power of that Abaddon of Rome, who beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mens ſenſes with ſuch fooleries, that he might robbe their purſes in his rich Iubilies.</p>

               <p>And now to come to confutation of the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Confutation.</note> it ſeemeth that Stage-playes cannot be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the number of recreations, and that for theſe three reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they are not worhie to be compared to any of the former lawfull recreations.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, the moſt perſons that ordinarily reſorte to them, are verie idle perſons, that ſhould rather be ſet to ſome honeſt labour, then ſo unprofitably to miſpend their time to their owne hurte.</p>

would be tedious to reade, and perhaps not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it ſeemeth rather convenient to call a greate number of them together out of all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their dwellings, and as it were out of all the world, that they all may be heard to ſpeake altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with one conſent and voyce. But becauſe it would be a verie tedious, and troubleſome thing, for ſo many, ſo reverend, and ſo old aged Fathers to travell ſo farre; it is more convenient and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to ſpare their labours ſo much as may be, and call them together at three ſeverall times, and in three ſeverall places of their habitations; that is, to call thoſe of Aſia, to meete together in Aſia: thoſe of Africa, in Africa: and thoſe of Europe, in Europe.</p>
               <p>In Aſia, about two and twentie of the moſt reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <note place="margin">Aſia,</note> Fathers of thoſe times, met together in Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea, ſomewhat more then 300 yeres after Chriſt, and holding a councill there, decreed cap. 54. that none of the Cleargie ſhould be preſent at Stage-playes. And the Centuriators of Magdeburg haue inſerted this whole Councill in their laborious and worthie hiſtorie Cent. 4. cap. 9. col. 834.</p>

And the ſame reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fathers then, and there decreed alſo cap. 35. That the church ſhould not tefuſe to receaue the Stage-players into their fellowſhip, if they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and renounced that their trade of playing. Whereby is evident that Stage-players in thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and purer times, were generally excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and caſt out of the ſocietie of the ſaintes.</p>
               <p>In Europe divers worthie and graue Fathers of the church, called and ſummoned by Conſtantinus <note place="margin">Europe.</note> Magnus, a little after the Nicene Councill, to come together at Arles in France, held two Councils there, the firſt, and ſhortly after the ſecond. In both which they decreed the excommunication of all Stage-players, ſo long as they continued that trade of life. And in the firſt Councill, cap. 5. thus they ſay: <hi>De theatricis, &amp; ipſos placuit, quandiu agunt, à communione ſeparari;</hi> that is, as touching Stage-players, we thinke it good, that whiles they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in that trade of life, they be kept from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And in the ſecond Councill held there preſently after, they decree the ſame thing againe, can. 20. and almoſt in the ſame words.</p>
               <p>But yet to giue in more evidence, we may haue all the worthie Fathers of the Churches in Aſia, Africa, and Europa, aſſembled together in the ſixt generall Council, which was held at Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, approue that which at Laodicea in Aſia, and at Carthage in Africa, was decreed againſt Stage-players.

               <p>And thus we haue the judgement of all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall and true Catholike Fathers of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches throughout the whole world, againſt Stage-players, and Stage-playing, with one conſent.</p>

Suetonius taxeth Nero for a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of them, and an actor among them. Arnobius lib. 7. contra gentes, appealing to the conſcience of the Heathen, ſheweth that they diſallow them, and ſayth thus of the Stage-players, <hi>actores inhoneſtos eſſe jus veſtrum judicavit,</hi> that is, your owne law hath adjudged the ſtage-players to be no honeſt men.</p>
