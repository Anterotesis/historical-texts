            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>OUr Chronicles tell us of a Man in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time that wrote the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Pater-noſter,</hi> the <hi>Queens Name,</hi> and the <hi>year of our Lord</hi> within the compaſſe of a Peny; and gave the Queen a paire of Spectacles of ſuch an Artificiall making, that by

the help thereof ſhe did plainly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly diſcern every Letter.</p>
            <p>The contracting of the Life and Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> in ſo narrow a compaſſe as I have limited to my ſelf, may ſeem to be a work of no leſſe difficulty. And yet I hope to do it in ſuch a plain and perſpicuous manner, that <hi>every one who runs may read it</hi> without the help of any ſuch Spectacles as our Chronicles ſpeak of. To <hi>Brevity</hi> I am injoyned, and it muſt be my buſineſſe to avoid all <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity</hi>; though I am conſcious to my ſelf, that I ſhall draw this Picture with too much ſhadow. But I take the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil into my hand, and thus form my <hi>lines.</hi>

               <p>On the 26. of <hi>March</hi> next following, <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. King <hi>James</hi> had news by Sir <hi>Robert Cary,</hi> one of the younger Sons of the Lord <hi>Hunſdon</hi> (who had ſtole a poſting journey thither) that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was dead, contrary to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of many of his <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; who being wearied with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe of their expectation, did believe at laſt, that it ſhould never be acknowledged by the Lords of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land that the Queen was dead, as long as there was any old woman of that Nation left, to weare good Clothes, and take the name of Queen upon her. For bringing which news the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> (as if he were more concerned in it then all the reſt of the Kings Children, as indeed he was) was afterwards committed to the Governance of Sir <hi>Roberts</hi> Lady, and he

himſelf from that time forwards of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall eſteem and place about him.</p>
               <p>This news being ſeconded by that of the Proclaiming of King <hi>James,</hi> for her true and lawfull Succeſſor in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Crown of this Realm, the King prepared himſelf for <hi>England.</hi> At what time (as I have been told by ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality) a certain Laird of the <hi>Highlands,</hi> though of very great Age, came to his Court, to take his leave of him, whom he found accompanied with all his Children, the young Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then held in his Nurſes Armes.</p>
               <p>His Addreſſe unto the King conſiſted of Prayers for his long life and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and thoſe Prayers intermixt with ſome deſires, that in the midſt of the Felicities and Glories of the Engliſh Court, he would not be unmindfull of his Native Countrey.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30218:5"/>
as if he meant they ſhould grow for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to his lips. And when the King told him, that he had miſtook himſelf in his Addreſſes to the infant, as not being his eldeſt Son, and Prince of <hi>Scotland</hi>; he anſwered, that he knew well enough what he did, and that it was this Child in whom his Name and Memory was to be perpetuated to ſucceeding Ages, with other Speeches of like nature. Which being then either unregarded, or imputed unto age and dotage, were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mind after the death of Prince <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and then believed to have ſomething in them of a Prophetical ſpirit.</p>

And on the 14 of <hi>February</hi> then next enſuing, being Sunday, and St. <hi>Valentines</hi> day, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Office of a Brideman (a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranymph the Grecians call him) to the Princeſſe <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Siſter, married upon that day to <hi>Frederick</hi> the Fifth, Prince Elector <hi>Palatine</hi>: A marriage which drew him afterwards into many cares and great expences, of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>In his Childhood he was noted to be very wilful, ſomewhat inclining to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe of diſpoſition, which might proceed from that retiredneſs which the imperfection of his Speech, not fitting him for publick diſcourſe, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his limbs and joynts (as unfit for Action) made him moſt delight in.</p>
               <p>But now being grown both in years, and ſtate, he began to ſhake off that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiredneſſe, and betake himſelf to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <pb n="13" facs="tcp:30218:8"/>
of man-like exerciſes; ſuch as were Vaulting, riding great Horſes, running at the ring, ſhooting in croſſe bowes, Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and ſometimes in great Pieces of Ordnance, in which he became ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that he was thought to be the beſt Marks-man, and the moſt comely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager of a great Horſe of any one in all three Kingdoms. And as he ſhaked off this retiredneſſe, ſo he corrected in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Peccancy of that humour which had grown up with it; there being no man to be found of an evener temper, more pliant to good Counſel, or leſſe wedded then he was to his own opinion.</p>

               <p>On the third of <hi>November, Anno</hi> 1616. He was at <hi>White-hall</hi> (with all the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed Solemnities) created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Earl of <hi>Chester</hi> and <hi>Flint,</hi> and put into the actuall poſſeſſion of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities, Profits, and Commodities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them; his Houſhould being then formed and conſtituted, and all the officers of State, which belong unto him, appointed to their ſeverall places.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:30218:9"/>And now it was expected that he ſhould break out into more glory then he had done formerly, and take upon him as the Heir of ſo great an Empire. But conſidering very wiſely that the forward and enterprizing nature of his Brother Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> the popularity which he affected, and the great reſort of young Noble-men continually unto his Court, had been diſpleaſing to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; reſolved to keep himſelf at a cloſe ward, and not to ſeem ſo great as he was, that when time ſerved, he might appear greater then he ſeemed to be. Old Princes do not love to have their eldeſt Sons too active, and to tread too cloſe upon their heels; and therefore many times do enterpoſe the power of a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to keep them at the greater diſtance. A policy much uſed by King <hi>James</hi> in the whole courſe of his Government, who for that cauſe in the life-time of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> took Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his moſt eſpeciall favour, whom he firſt made Gentleman of his Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and on the twenty fifth of <hi>March

Anno</hi> 1611. Created Viſcount <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and the ſame year made Knight of the Garter alſo, conferring on him all the power and truſt he was capable of; that by the greatneſſe of the one he might keep down the daring nature and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Spirit of the other.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Charles</hi> underſtood this well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and carried himſelf with ſo much prudence, that he diſputed not the power of his Fathers favourites, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering all Honour, Offices, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters at the Court to be carried by them as beſt pleaſed the King. Which though it was generally aſcribed unto Puſillanimity, and the defect of Spirit in him, yet was it look'd upon as an Act of the greateſt wiſedom by more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men. For had he any wayes croſt the deſigns and Councels either of <hi>Carr</hi> then Earl of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> or of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> his Fathers favourites (who at that time did much out-ſhine him) he had not only incurred the Kings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, but of neceſſity muſt have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Court, and by conſequence

               <p>Onely to take off ſomewhat of the imputation, he made ſo much uſe of his power and intereſſe with the King, as to prefer three of his ſervants unto Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Honour, <hi>Anno</hi> 1621. <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Cary</hi> Chamberlain of his Houſhold, to the Title of Lord <hi>Cary</hi> of <hi>Lepington</hi>; Sir <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> ſecond Son to the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and Maſter of his Horſe, to the Honour of Viſcount <hi>Andover,</hi> and Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Charlton</hi>; and Sir <hi>John Vaughan</hi> Controller of his Houſhold, to the Honour of Lord <hi>Vaughan</hi> of <hi>Molin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> in the Realm of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

up the greateſt part of his Houſhold, and not well principled by thoſe which had the tutelage of him, either as to the Government or <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The King acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſad truth, and condemning his own negligence in it, made a ſolemn vow, that if God would be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to his health, he would take the Prince into his own immediate care, inſtruct him in the Controverſies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſet him on ſo right a bottome, that there ſhould be no fear of his diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection either unto the Hierarchy, or the rites and Ceremonies of the Church; which he did accordingly. And he did it ſo effectually, that at ſuch time as the Prince made his journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> and that ſome principal perſons in all the Places and Offices belonging to him, were to follow after, Dr. <hi>Maw,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wren,</hi> two of his Chaplains being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that ſervice, came to King <hi>James</hi> to know his pleaſure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.

Diſputations, but to be onely on the defenſive part, if they ſhould be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged. And when it was anſwered that there could be no reaſon to engage in ſuch Diſputations, where there could be no Moderator; the King replied, that <hi>Charles</hi> ſhould moderate between them and the oppoſite party. At which when one of them ſeemed to ſmile on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the King proceeded, and told them, that <hi>Charles</hi> ſhould manage a point in Controverſie with the beſt ſtudied Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine of them all; and that he had trained up <hi>George</hi> ſo far as to hold the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though he had not yet made him able to prove the Premiſſes.</p>

               <p>According to this Reſolution he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his journey, no otherwiſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied or attended then with thoſe three perſons above mentioned, all of them paſſing in diſguiſe, to avoid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30218:13"/>
then the <hi>French</hi> King had Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his being there, who thereupon diſpatcht away ſeverall Poſts to ſtay him in his journey, and bring him back; but the Prince had paſt beyond <hi>Bayonne,</hi> the laſt Town in <hi>France,</hi> without being overtaken by them, and poſting ſpeedily to <hi>Madrid,</hi> entred the Lord Embaſſadors Lodging, without being known to any but his Confidents onely.</p>
               <p>News of his ſafe Arrivall there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the King, there was a preſent order taken for the ſending of ſome of his Servants of all ſorts, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon him in that Court, that ſo he might appear amongſt them in the greater Luſtre. But this leſſened not the Cares and Feares of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, who could not be more glad to hear of his ſafety, then they were afraid of the danger which he had incurred. For having put himſelf into the power of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> it was at the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie of that King whether he ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return or no: it being a Maxime
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30218:14"/>
amongſt Princes, That if any one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave ſets foot on the Ground of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, he makes himſelf his Priſoner.</p>

So in like manner <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt of <hi>England,</hi> paſſing in diſguiſe through ſome part of the dominions of the Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> was by him took Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and put unto an heavy Ranſome; and not long ſince <hi>Charles Lodowick</hi> the now Prince Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> poſting through <hi>France,</hi> in hope to get the Command of Duke <hi>Bernards</hi> Army, was ſtayed in the middle of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by the Kings command, and kept

ſo long under Reſtraint, that he loſt the opportunity of effecting his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſe.</p>
               <p>This, though it was the generall Fear and apprehenſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, yet no body durſt acquaint the King with it, but <hi>Archee</hi> the <hi>fool,</hi> who going boldly to the King, as he found him once in a good humour, told him that he was come to change Caps with him.

But ſaid the King, what wilt thou ſay when thou ſeeſt him come back again? Marry, ſaies <hi>Archee,</hi> I will then take off the fools Cap which I put upon thy head, for ſending him thither, and put it on the King of <hi>Spains,</hi> for letting him return. At which words, it is reported, that the King became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding penſive, never before ſo much apprehending the Danger of that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, as then and afterwards he did.</p>

               <p>But the generous <hi>Spaniard</hi> intended to make no ſuch Market of him, but gave him all the Royall entertainment which a Princely Suitor might expect. Nor was the Prince wanting for his part in all fit Compliances by which he might both gain on them, and preſerve himſelf. For by his Courtly Garb he won ſo much on the Affections of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and by his grave and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect behaviour got ſo much ground upon the King and his Councel, that the match went forward in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. The Articles of the Marriage with all the Circumſtances thereof were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, and ſolemnly ſworn to by both Kings. Nor was the Pope want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the grant of a diſpenſation (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which nothing could be done) wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Letter to the Prince, who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him a Civil anſwer, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was reckoned amongſt his Crimes, by ſuch as rather would not then did not know the neceſſity which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30218:15"/>
lay upon him, of keeping at that time a plauſible Correſpondence with the Catholick party.</p>
               <p>But as for his Religion, the change whereof was moved by the Pope, and much hoped for by the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> at his firſt coming thither, he ſhewed ſo many ſtrong evidences of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in it, that thoſe hopes ſoon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. And that it might appear, that he profeſſed no other Religion, then what was agreeable to the Rules of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and not much abhorrent from the formes then uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgie was by the care of the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue; and ſo many Copies of the Book then printed ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> as gave great ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in that point to the Court and Clergy.</p>
               <p>And this I muſt needs ſay was very ſeaſonably done, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being till then perſwaded by their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> that when the <hi>Engliſh had caſt off</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> they had caſt off alſo all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30218:16"/>
and became meer <hi>Atheiſts</hi>; the name of God being never uſed amongſt them, but with a purpoſe to expoſe it unto ſcorn and prophanation.
Inſomuch that the <q>Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> being ſent to ſwear the Peace concluded with <hi>Spain,</hi> when he underſtood the buſineſſe was to be performed in the <hi>Chappel,</hi> where ſome <hi>Anthems</hi> were to be ſung, deſired <hi>that whatſoever was ſung, Gods name might not be uſed in it, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forborn, he was content they ſhould ſing what they liſted.</hi>

King <hi>James</hi> himſelf ſo relates the ſtory in Arch-Biſhop <hi>Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, fol.</hi> 530.</p>
               <p>But the Prince had another game to play, namely, the Reſtitution of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi>; which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would not ſuffer to be brought under the Treaty, reſerving it (as they pretended to be beſtowed by the <hi>Infanta</hi> after the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the better to ingratiate her ſelf with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. Which being a point of too great moment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon no other aſſurance then a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30218:16"/>
Court-Complement, he concluded with himſelf that ſince he could not prevaile in the one, he would not proceed unto the Conſummation of the other. And hereupon he was much edged on by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome deep diſpleaſure againſt the <hi>Conde de Olivarez,</hi> the ſpeciall Favourite of that King, deſired rather that all Treaties ſhould be broken off, then that any Alliance ſhould be made in which that <hi>Conde</hi> had appeared ſo inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>
               <p>But it did concern the Prince ſo to provide for his own ſafety, that no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation might be made of the intended Rupture, till he had unwinded himſelf out of that <hi>Labyrinth</hi> into which he was caſt. For which cauſe having deſired of his Father that ſome ſhips might be ſent to bring him home, he ſhewed himſelf a more paſſionate lover then ever formerly, and made a <hi>Proxie</hi> to the Catholick King and Don <hi>Charles</hi> his Brother, in his name to eſpouſe the Lady <hi>Infanta</hi>; which <hi>Proxie</hi> he left

               <p>But no ſooner had he took his leave, and was out of danger, but he diſpatcht a Poſt unto him, commanding him not to deliver up the <hi>Proxie</hi> untill further order. And having ſo done, he hois'd Sails, and came for <hi>England,</hi> arriving at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> on Sunday the fifth of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Anno</hi> 1623. From whence by Poſt-Horſes he paſt to <hi>London,</hi> the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſo by Coach to the King at <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> to the great content of all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, declared by Bells, Bonfires, and all other the accuſtomed expreſſions of a publick joy.</p>
               <p>The King being made acquainted with all particulars, and that no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance could be had of the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> by the advice of his Privy Councel, diſpatcht a command to the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> not to deliver up the Proxie unleſſe the buſineſſe of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi> were concluded alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30218:17"/>
whereof not being anſwered by Succeſſe, a Parliament is ſummoned, to begin on the ſixteenth day of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> then next following, to the end that all things might be governed in this great Affair by the publick Counſel of the Kingdom. Not long after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof, the Duke declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both Houſes (more to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> then there was juſt ground for) how unhandſomely they had dealt with the Prince, when he was in <hi>Spain</hi>; how they had fed him with delaies; what indignities they had put upon him, and finally had ſent him back not onely without the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> but without a Wife; leaving it to their prudent Conſideration what courſe to follow.</p>
               <p>It was thereupon voted by both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that his Majeſty ſhould be deſired to break off all Treaties with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to engage himſelf in a war againſt him for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> not otherwiſe to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And that they might come the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30218:18"/>
better to the end they aimed at, they addreſſe themſelves unto the Prince, whom they aſſured, that they would ſtand to him in that War to the very laſt expence of their lives and fortunes; and he accordingly being further ſet on by the Duke, became their inſtrument to perſwade his Father to hearken to the Common Votes and deſires of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which the King, preſt by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall importunities, did at the laſt aſſent to.</p>
               <p>But in the conduct of this Buſineſſe, the Prince conſulted more the Dukes paſſion, and the pleaſing of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament, then either his own or the Regall intereſſe. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more unſafe for a King of <hi>England,</hi> then to caſt himſelf upon the neceſſity of calling Parliaments, and depending on the purſe of the Subject. By means whereof he makes himſelf obnoxious to the Humour of any prevailing Member in the Houſe of Commons, and becomes leſſe in Reputation both at home and abroad. The Commons,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30218:18"/>
ſince the time of King <hi>James,</hi> have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome parted with a peny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they have paid themſelves well for it out of the prerogative.</p>
               <p>And this appeared by their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in this very Parliament: For though they had ingaged the King in a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> and granted him three <hi>Subſidies</hi> and three <hi>Fifteens</hi> toward the beginning of that War; yet would they not ſuffer that grant to paſſe into an Act of Parliament, till the King had yielded to another againſt <hi>Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Inſomuch as it was affirmed by Juſtice <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> at the next Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſizes held in <hi>Oxford,</hi> that the King by paſſing that Act, had bought thoſe <hi>Subſidies</hi> and <hi>Fifteens</hi> at ten years purchaſe. Nor dealt they otherwiſe with this Prince then they did with his Father, thoſe very Commons who had ingaged him in the Warre, and bound themſelves to make good that ingagement with their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, moſt ſhamefully deſerting him in the firſt Parliament of his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30218:19"/>
Reign, and after working more and more upon his neceſſities, till they had robbed him of the richeſt Jewels in the Regal Diadem.</p>

               <p>But to proceed, the Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi> being like to come to a Rupture, it was judged neceſſary to counterbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Power of that King by nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating a Match with the Princeſſe <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietta Maria,</hi> the youngeſt Daughter of <hi>France</hi>; firſt ſet on foot by the Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> who found that Court inclinable thereunto, and afterwards concluded at the coming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Earl of <hi>Carlile,</hi> joyned in Commiſſion to that purpoſe.

               <p>During theſe preparations for War and Marriage, King <hi>James</hi> departed this life at <hi>Theobalds</hi> on Sunday the twenty ſeventh of <hi>March, Anno</hi> 1625.

               <p>The Funeralls of the deceaſed King were celebrated on the ſeventh of <hi>May,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:30218:20"/>
his body being brought from <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> with great Magnificence to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> (where he was interred) the King himſelf being principall Mourner.

               <p>The Funerall being paſt, he thought it was time for him to quicken the coming over of his deareſt Conſort, to whom he had been married on the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day before at the Church of <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi>; the Duke of <hi>Chevereux</hi> a Prince of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> (from which Houſe King <hi>Charles</hi> derived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Lorain,</hi> Wife to <hi>James</hi> the fifth) eſpouſing the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in his Name.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Trinity Sunday,</hi> late at night, ſhe was brought by a Royall Fleet of Ships from <hi>Bulloign</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> which being ſignified to the King who was

then at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he went to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the next morning, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her with great expreſſions of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, profeſſing that he would be no longer Maſter of himſelf, then whileſt he was a Servant to her.

               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:30218:21"/>But in the heat of theſe Solemnities and entertainments, the King forgat not the main Concernments of himſelf and the Kingdome, and to that end began his firſt Parliament on Saturday the eighteenth of <hi>June,</hi> which fell out not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably, that the <hi>French</hi> Lords might ſee with what Royall Magnificence he was attended by the Peers, Prelates, and other Officers of State (beſides his own Domeſtick Servants) to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Houſe.</p>
               <p>At their firſt meeting, he put them in mind of the War in which they had ingaged his Father, and of the promiſe they had made to ſtand to him in it with their lives and fortunes; that both his Land and Sea-forces were now in readineſſe to ſet forwards, and that there wanted nothing but a preſent ſupply of money to quicken and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite the Affair. In Anſwer whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the Commons paſt a Bill of two Subſidies onely, ſo ſhort of the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Charge which the maintenance of ſo great a Fleet and Army required
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30218:21"/>
at their hands, that being diſtributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Officers, Souldiers, and Mariners, it would ſcarce have ſerved for <hi>Advance-money</hi> to ſend them going. Which notwithſtanding, the King very graciouſly accepted of it, taking it as an <hi>Erneſt</hi> of their good Affections, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the greater Summes which were to follow.</p>
               <p>But the Plague growing hot in <hi>London,</hi> the Parliament on the eleventh day of <hi>July</hi> was adjourned to <hi>Oxford,</hi> there to be held on the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at what time the King put them in mind again of the neceſſity of ſetting forward his Fleet, and that the eyes of his Confederates were fixt upon it. But the Commons had <hi>other fiſh to fry,</hi> and began to quarrel at the greatneſſe of the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> whom in the laſt Parliament of King <hi>James</hi> they had idolized above all men living. But he had ſerved their turn already, and now they meant to ſerve their own.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt Aſſault which the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30218:22"/>
Commons made upon this King, though not directly on his Perſon, wounding him through the ſides of his principal Miniſter; they were ſo well verſt in the Arts of a Parliament-war, as to take in the Out-works firſt, that ſo the <hi>Fort</hi> it ſelf might lie the more open to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Batteries. Concerning which, and the ſad conſequents thereof, take here the words of a Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the King from an unknown Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Theſe men, ſaith he, either cannot or will not remember, that never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Noble man in favour with his Soveraign, was queſtioned in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except by the King himſelf in caſe of Treaſon, or unleſſe it were in the Nonage and tumultuous time of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. or <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. which hapned to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both of the King and Kingdome. And that, not to exceed our own and Fathers Memories, in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight's time, <hi>Wolſies</hi> exorbitant power and pride, and <hi>Cromwels</hi> contempt of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30218:22"/>
the Nobility and the Lawes, were not yet permitted to be diſcuſſed in Parliament, though they were moſt odious and grievous to all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And that <hi>Leiceſters</hi> undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved favour and faults; <hi>Hattons</hi> inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, and <hi>Rawleighs</hi> inſolence far exceeded what yet hath been (though moſt falſly) objected againſt the Duke; yet no Lawyer durſt abet, nor any man elſe begin any inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives againſt them in Parliament. And then he addes (ſome other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages intervening) that it behoves his Majeſty to uphold the Duke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, who if he be but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courted, it will be the corner-ſtone on which the demoliſhing of his Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy will be builded. For if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with this, they have hatched a thouſand other Demands to pull the feathers of the Royalty, they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him Counſellours, Servants, Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, Limits of his Expenſes, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts of his Revenue, chiefly if they can (as they mainly deſire) they will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30218:23"/>
now dazle him in the beginning of his Reign.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How true a Prophet this man proved, the event hath ſhewn, and the King ſaw it well enough, and therefore ſince he could not divert them from that purſuit, he diſſolved the Parliament, by whoſe neglect (I will not call it a perverſeneſſe) the Fleet went out late, and returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſperouſly. In which conjuncture, if he had clapt up a Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> (which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had as much reaſon to accept as he to offer) he might have prevented the following Rupture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and <hi>France,</hi> and freed himſelf from the neceſſity of calling Parliaments, till he had no neceſſity for a Parliament to work upon, and then he might have found them as pliant to him as he could reaſonably require.</p>
               <p>But he reſolves to try his fortune in another as ſoon as he had performed the Solemnities of his Coronation, which was celebrated on the ſecond of <hi>February,</hi> (commonly called <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:30218:23"/>
Day) then next enſuing. In the externall Pomp whereof, he omitted his triumphant riding thorow the City from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> the Charge whereof would have ſtood him in ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand pounds, as ſome compute it; and he had then more neceſſary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to expend his money, then Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to anſwer thoſe occaſions. In the ſacred part of it, there was nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, but the adding of a clauſe to one of the Prayers which had been preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſince the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and is this that followeth, viz. <hi>Let him obtain favour for the People, like</hi> Aaron <hi>in the Tabernacle,</hi> Eliſha <hi>in the Waters,</hi> Zacharias <hi>in the Temple; give him Peters key of Diſcipline, Pauls Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> Which clauſe had been omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in time of Popery, as intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction to be given to our Kings then the Popes allowed of; and for the ſame reaſon was now quarrel'd by the <hi>Puritan</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. As for the Coronation-oath, it was the ſame which had been taken by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30218:24"/>
his Predeceſſors, as appears by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of <hi>Exchequer</hi>; Not made more advantageous to the King, and leſſe beneficiall to the People by the late Archbiſhop, though both the long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the year 1642. and the lewd Pamphlets of that time did object the contrary.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Coronation</hi> being paſſed over, he began his ſecond Parliament on the ſixth of the ſame moneth, in which he ſped no better then he did in his firſt. The Commons voted ſome Subſidies to be granted to him, but they never paſt them into Act, that bait being onely laid before him, to tempt him to give over the Duke to their pride and fury, againſt whom they had framed a large impeachment uſhered in by Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs,</hi> proſecuted with ſix bitter invectives, made by the beſt Speakers and moſt learned Lawyers of that Houſe, and finally concluded by Sir <hi>John Eliot,</hi> who brought up the Rear.</p>

               <p>But the King eaſily perceived that his Royal Father and himſelf were as much concerned in it as the Duke, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours being made his crimes, and their authority in beſtowing Offices and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours on whom they pleaſed, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely queſtioned.</p>
               <p>But the ſtorm went higher then the Duke, ſome part of it falling down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right on the King himſelf; it being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly affirmed in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons by one Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> (a true chip of the old block) <hi>that it was as good to die by a forraign Enemy as to be deſtroyed at home.</hi> Of this reproach, tending ſo much to the diſhonour of his Government, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in a Speech before both Houſes, but without any remedy. And being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incenſed by the noiſe of a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they had then upon the Anvil, he diſſolved the Parliament on the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of <hi>June</hi> then following.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was he freed from this,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30218:25"/>
but the neceſſity of his Affairs involved him in another Embroylment. The <hi>French</hi> Prieſts and Domeſticks of that Nation which came into <hi>England</hi> with the Queen, were grown ſo inſolent, and had put ſo many affronts upon him, that he was forced to ſend them home; in which he did no more then what the <hi>French</hi> King had done before him, in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding back all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Courtiers which his Queen brought with her. But the <hi>French</hi> King not looking on his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and knowing on what ill termes the King ſtood both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, firſt ſeized on all the Merchants ſhips which lay on the River of <hi>Burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> and then brake out into open war. So that the King was fain to make uſe of thoſe Forces againſt the <hi>French,</hi> which were deſigned to have been uſed againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and to comply with the deſires of the <hi>Rochelers,</hi> who humbly ſued for his protection and Defence. But the Fleet not going out till after <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> found greater oppoſition at
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30218:25"/>
the Sea then they feared from the Land; being encountred with ſtrong Tempeſts, and thereby neceſſitated to return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any thing, but onely ſhewing the Kings good-will and readineſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their aſſiſtance.</p>

               <p>But the next yeare this deſign was followed with greater vigour by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who hoped there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make himſelf of ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the eyes of the people. The gaining of the Iſle of <hi>Re,</hi> which lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Town of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred their Trade, was the matter aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at; and he had ſtrength enough both for Sea and Land to have done the work, if he had not followed it more like a Courtier then a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſuffering himſelf to be comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented out of the taking of their chief Fort, when it was almoſt at his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and ſtanding upon points of <hi>Honour</hi> in facing thoſe Forces which were

ſent from the <hi>French</hi> King to raiſe the ſiege, when he might have made a ſafe retreat unto his ſhips without loſſe or danger.</p>
               <p>In the mean time his Majeſty neither neglected his Affairs at home nor his Friends abroad: At home he found the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction to be much increaſed by the remiſneſſe of the goverment of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> whom therefore he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from all his Metropoliticall Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and confined him to his Houſe at <hi>Ford</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> committing the exerciſe thereof to the Biſhops of <hi>London, Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Rochester, Oxford, Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> by Letters Patents, bearing date the 9. day of <hi>October, Anno</hi> 1627.

The conſideration of which laſt induced him to yield to their deſires, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that petition by Act of Parliament, the <hi>Prerogative</hi> never ſo much deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from Perch to popular Lure, as by that conceſſion. But though this Act of grace might have given ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton even to ſupererogation (as one well obſerveth) yet the Commons were not ſo contented, but were preparing a Remonſtance to take away his Right of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> as diſclaimed by him in that Act; which coming to the Kings knowledge, on the twenty
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30218:27"/>
ſixth of <hi>June,</hi> he adjourns the Parliament till the twentieth day of <hi>October</hi> then next enſuing.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Duke prepares for the relief of <hi>Rochel,</hi> both by Sea and Land, and being ready to ſet ſail, was ſuddenly cut off at <hi>Ports-muth</hi> by the hand of one <hi>John Felton,</hi> a diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Officer of the laſt years Army, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging no other reaſon for that bloody act, but that the Duke had been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an Enemy to the Common-wealth, in a <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> tendred to the King in the former Seſſion.</p>
               <p>But ſuch was the conſtancy of the Kings temper, and the known evenneſs of his ſpirit, that this ſad Accident made little or no ſtop in the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Fleet, which at the laſt ſet forwards under the command of the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi>; who found the Haven of <hi>Rochel</hi> ſo ſtrongly barred, that it was utterly impoſſible for his Ships to force their way (though it was gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30218:28"/>
attempted) and give relief to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged; who thereupon ſet open their Gates, and received their King into their Town without more delay.</p>
               <p>To ſmooth his way to the next Seſſion of Parliament, adjourned again till the twentieth of <hi>January,</hi> Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> is admitted to kiſſe his hand, by whom he is commanded not to fail of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at the Councel table; <hi>Dr. Barnaby Potter</hi> (a through-paced Calvinian) is made Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> book called <hi>Appello Caeſarem</hi> (for which he had been queſtioned and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted in the beginning of the Kings firſt Parliament) muſt be ſuppreſt and called in by Proclamation.</p>
               <p>But this little edified with the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the houſe of Commons, who not onely took upon them the reforming of the Church and State, but called the <hi>Cuſtomers</hi> in queſtion for levying <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> not then granted (nor ever likely to be granted as it had
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30218:28"/>
been formerly) by Act of Parliament, and diſtraining ſuch Merchants goods as refuſed to pay it. And in this point they went ſo high, that fearing they ſhould be diſſolved before they had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their own paſſions in that particular, upon the ſecond day of <hi>March</hi> they lockt the Doors of the Parliament-houſe, kept the key thereof in one of their pockets, and held the Speaker by ſtrong hand in his Chair, till they had thundred out their Anathemaes not onely againſt ſuch as ſhould dare to levie it, but thoſe alſo who ſhould willingly pay it. The news of which riotous proceeding being brought immediately to the King, he ſent his Band of Penſioners, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his ordinary Guard, to force open the doors, and going himſelf to the Houſe of Peers, he diſſolved the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not having continued in that Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on above forty dayes.</p>
               <p>At the end of the former Seſſion he had admitted Sir <hi>John Savill</hi> of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> a buſie man in the Houſe

little aid from thence for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of it, by the advice of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of that Kingdome, was put upon a courſe of reſuming thoſe Lands, Tithes and Regalities into his own hands, to which the preſent Occupants could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no other Title then the unjuſt uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of their Anceſtors. This he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, firſt by an Act of <hi>Revocation,</hi> but that courſe not being like to ſpeed, he followed it in the way of a legal proceſſe, which drew on the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for <hi>ſurrendering</hi> of <hi>Superiorities</hi> and <hi>Tithes,</hi> to be retaken from the King on ſuch conditions, as might bring ſome profit to the Crowne, ſome Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Clergy, and far more eaſe and benefit to the common people. But theſe proud <hi>Scots</hi> chuſe rather to expoſe their Countrey to the danger of a publick Ruine, then to part with any of that power (it might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Tyranny rather) which they had exerciſed on their <hi>Vaſſals,</hi> as they commonly called them; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſpired together to oppoſe the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:30218:32"/>
King in any thing that ſhould be offered in the following Parliament, which had relation to the Church or to Church-affaires.</p>
               <p>But becauſe Religion and the care thereof, is commonly the beſt bait to catch the vulgar, they muſt find out ſome other means to divert the King from the proſecuting of that <hi>Commiſſion</hi>; then the conſideration of their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall and private intereſſe; and they found means to do it on another occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was briefly this.</p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> from his firſt coming to this Crown, had a deſign to bring the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> to an uniformity with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> both in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and forms of worſhip. And he proceeded ſo far as to ſettle <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> amongſt them, naming thirteen new Biſhops for ſo many Epiſcopal Sees as had been anciently in that Church; three of which received Conſecration from the Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it on the reſt of their Brethren at

their coming home. Which Biſhops he armed alſo with the power of an <hi>High Commiſsion,</hi> the better to keep down the inſolent and domineering Spirit of the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> In order to the other, he procured an Act to be paſſed in the Aſſembly at <hi>Aberdeen, Anno</hi> 1616. for compoſing a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and extracting a new book of Canons out of the ſcattered Acts of their old <hi>Aſſemblies.</hi> At the Aſſembly held at <hi>Perth, Anno</hi> 1618. he obtained an Order for receiving the <hi>Communion</hi> kneeling, for adminiſtring Baptiſme and the Lords Supper in private Houſes, in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of extreme neceſsity, for Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall confirmation; and finally, for the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating the Anniverſaries of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Birth, his Pasſion, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and the coming down of the Holy Ghoſt. All which he got to be confirmed in the following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>So far that wiſe King had advanced the work of Uniformity, before his engaging in the Cauſe of the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:30218:33"/>
His Breach with <hi>Spain,</hi> and the War which did inſue upon it took off his thoughts from proſecuting that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which his ſon, being more intangled in Wars abroad and Diſtempers at home, had no time to finiſh till he had ſetled his Affaires, and attained to ſome meaſure both of Power and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But being it was a buſineſſe which was to be acted leiſurely and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, not all at once, he firſt reſolved upon paſſing of an Act of <hi>Ratification</hi> of all that had been done by his Father, and then to go in hand with the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of a publick <hi>Liturgie.</hi> In the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting whereof, at ſuch a time as he went into <hi>Scotland</hi> to receive that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Crown, he found a ſtronger op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the Parliament of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alſo, about the paſsing of that Act of <hi>Ratification,</hi> then he had reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect: But carried it at laſt by a far major part of that Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>This gave him the fiſt taſte of their diſaffection to his Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30218:33"/>
but he went forward notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in purſuit of thoſe purpoſes, which he brought thither with him. For not long after his return into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he gave order to the Dean of his Chappell Royall in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be read therein according to the Engliſh Liturgie; that a Communion be had every moneth, and all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants to receive the Sacrament on their knees; that he who officiated, if he be a Biſhop, perform it in his Rochet and other Epiſcopall Robes; and that he do it in his Surplice, if a common Presbyter; and finally, that not onely the Lords of the Council, but the Lords of the Seſſion, and as many of the principall Magiſtrates of that City alſo as could conveniently, fail not of their attending the Divine Service there on Sundayes and Holy-dayes: For by this means he gave himſelf no improbable hopes, that the Engliſh Liturgy paſſing a probationerſhip in the Chappel Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, might find a plauſible entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Churches of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:30218:34"/>
and be received by degrees in all the reſt of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Presbyterian Scots</hi> not ignorant of the Kings intentions, inſinuated into the minds of the common People, that this was a deſign onely to ſubject that pure Kirk to the ſuperſtitious Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and therefore that it did behove them to ſtand together as one man to oppoſe their entrance.</p>
               <p>The Lords and Gentry of that Realm, who feared nothing ſo much as the Commiſſion of <hi>Surrendries</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, laid hold on this occaſion alſo: And they being ſeconded by ſome male-contented ſpirits of that Nation, who had not found the King to be as prodigal of his favours to them as his Father had been before, endeavoured to poſſeſſe them with <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies,</hi> that <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was to be reduced to the form of a Province, and governed by a Deputy or Lord Lieutenant, as <hi>Ireland</hi> was. The like done alſo by ſome Lords of Secret Council, who before had governed as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30218:34"/>
they liſted, and thought their power di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed and their perſons under ſome neglect, by the placing of a Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent over them to direct in chief.</p>
               <p>So that the people generally being fooled into this opinion, that both their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Liberty were in no ſmall danger, became capable of any impreſsion which the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could imprint upon them. Which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly appeared by a virulent and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Libel, publiſhed in the year 1634. wherein the King was not only charged with altering the Government of that Kingdom, but traduced for very ſtrong inclinations to the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The chief Abettor whereof (for the Authour was not to be found) was the Lord <hi>Balmerino,</hi> for which he was legally convicted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of treaſon but pardoned by the Kings great goodneſſe, and by that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don kept alive for the miſchiefs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:30218:35"/>The fire thus breaking out in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it was no marvel if it had laid hold on <hi>England</hi> alſo, the Puritans of both Nations working themſelves about this time into a Body, and from henceforth communicating their Counſels and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns unto one another.</p>
               <p>The King not long after his return thought fit to renew his Fathers Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration about <hi>lawfull ſports</hi> on the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> the principall motives whereunto were, the increaſe of Popery in ſome parts of the Kingdome, occaſioned by interdicting all honeſt Recreations on that day, and the reſt of the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes; the tendency of the Sabbatari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine to down-right <hi>Judaiſme</hi>; ſome orders made by ſome publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Juſtice, for ſuppreſsing the Annual Feaſts of the Dedication of Churches, commonly called <hi>Wakes</hi>; and finally, the bringing of Dancing, Running, ſhooting and other harmleſſe Recreations, within the compaſſe of the Statute made in the firſt Parliament of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30218:35"/>
his Reign <hi>againſt all unlawfull exerciſes and pastimes</hi>; in which no ſuch thing was ever intended.

And thereupon, by the Advice of Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> his Attorny Generall, he iſſued certain writs in the tenth year of his Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. directed to all the Port Towns of the Kingdome, to ſet out a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſhips furniſht with Mariners. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, Victuals, and all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, for defence of the Realm; which Writs he afterwards extended alſo to the inland Counties, following therein the examples of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, in which none was better able to inſtruct him, then he that gave him that Advice. By means whereof he did not only recover that Dominion, which belonged to him on the Sea, but very much improved and enricht the Land, as before is ſaid. Which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſome of the diſcontented mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the former Parliament, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the ſame party, under colour of ſtanding in defence of the Rights and Properties of the Subject, did ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30218:37"/>
oppoſe the payment of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, in which the Honour, Wealth, and Happineſſe of this Kingdome was ſo much concerned. And though the King had the opinion of all the Judges, under their hands to juſtifie his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in it; yet choſe he rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt them in a legall way, then to make uſe of any arbitrary power, or the opinion of the Judges, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra judicially had been given in the caſe. And ſo well did he proſper in it, that when it came to be argued in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer-Chamber, of the twelve Judges, ten abſolutely declared themſelves for the lawfulneſſe of it; the other two (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Crook</hi> and <hi>Hutton</hi>) diſſenting openly from that opinion, to which they had formerly ſubſcribed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that here being a mixture alſo both of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Liberties, which were given out to be in danger; it is no marvel if the Faction in both Nations did conſpire together, to diſturb the peace and happineſſe of this flouriſhing Kingdom.</p>

               <p>The ground thus laid, it was thought fit the firſt part of the Tragedy ſhould be plaid in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Biſhops of that Church, though they liked well enough of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy, deſired a Liturgy of their own, for fear of acknowledging ſome dependency of that Church on this; which being compoſed amongſt themſelves, and approved by ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelates, to whom his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty referred the peruſall of it, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the <hi>Scots</hi> for the uſe of that Church, and the twenty third day of <hi>July, Anno</hi> 1637. appointed for the firſt exerciſe and reading of it: on this occaſion followed the ſedition at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> encouraged under-hand by the Marqueſſe of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow</hi> and <hi>Traquair,</hi> and many other of the Kings falſe ſervants, both in Court and Councel.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30218:38"/>
againſt the Book of Common-Prayer, and the Kings proceedings in the ſame, engaging the whole Nation in a ſolemn Covenant for the Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Epiſcopacy, and whatſoever they were pleaſed to comprehend under the generall Names of <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in which not onely the five Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Perth,</hi> but the whole Common-Prayer-Book was intended by them.

found the King reſolved not to yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they were reſolved to do it without him; in their Aſſembly held at <hi>Glaſco,</hi> aboliſhing the Epiſcopal Order, and thundring their <hi>Anathema's</hi> and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, not onely againſt the Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops themſelves, but all ſuch as adhered unto them.

               <p>This forced the King to ſet forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, accompanied with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Royall, and furniſhed with ſuch a gallant Company of Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, as might aſſure him of a cheap and eaſie victory. But he conceiving that the terrour of his coming would reduce the <hi>Scots</hi> to obedience without blows or bloodſhed, reſolved in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>not to out-go Muſter and Oſtentation</hi>; and thereupon was very eaſily intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30218:39"/>
to refer all differences between them to certain Commiſſioners of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
               <p>By their negotiation a generall Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord was made at <hi>Barwick</hi> on the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>June Anno</hi> 1639. upon which the King preſently disbanded his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and returned towards <hi>London,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving effected nothing by his chargeable expedition, but his making the <hi>Scots</hi> more inſolent then before they were, and giving them a greater Reputation in the eye of the world then before they had; of which he became aſſured and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible when it was too late.</p>
               <p>For no ſooner had he disbanded his Army, but the <hi>Pacification</hi> (ſuch as it was) was openly proteſted againſt in the <hi>Scots</hi> Army; and many falſe copies of it were ſcattered abroad, to make it more diſhonourable to the King, and of more advantage to themſelves. The Officers of their Army were retained in pay, the old form of holding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments in that Kingdom was altered
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30218:40"/>
by them, and the prerogatives of the Crown invaded; their words and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions tending to a more generall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection then before. So that the King was fain call home his Sheat-Anchor the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whom not long after he created Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> in the County of <hi>York.</hi> By whoſe advice, ſeconded by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> his Majeſty about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>December</hi> gave a publick inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a Parliament, to begin on the thirteenth day of <hi>April</hi> then next following.</p>
               <p>And it was intimated ſo long before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand for theſe two reaſons. Firſt, that the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> might in the mean time hold a Parliament in that Kingdome, which he did, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo much to the Kings advantage, that an Army of 8000 Horſe and Foot was ſpeedily raiſed, and money gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Parliament to keep them in pay, and furniſh them with Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Arms, and all other neceſſaries. Secondly, that by the Reputation of a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30218:40"/>
following Parliament, he might be the better enabled to borrow money for the carrying on of the war, in caſe the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhould fail him, as it after did. For being come together at the time appointed, inſtead of Acting any thing in order to his Majeſties ſervice, they were at the point of paſſing a <hi>Vote</hi> for blaſting his war againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> To prevent which his Majeſty was forced to diſſolve them on the fifth of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Convocation</hi> ſtill continuing, who granted him a Benevolence of foure ſhillings in the pound for all their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall promotions, to be paid ſix years together then next enſuing.</p>
               <p>The Members of the diſſolved Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament inflamed the people in all parts of the Kingdome with ſuch diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which actually brake out in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark</hi> into open ſedition, not pacified without much danger, and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the principal Leader. In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of which Diſtempers his Majeſty was bleſt with a third Son, born on the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:30218:41"/>

               <p>To welcome this young Prince into the world, the <hi>Scots</hi> put themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Armes again, and backt by a ſtrong faction here, thought that they could not do enough by ſtanding on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at home, unleſſe they entred <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> alſo, as they did accordingly. But they took not his Majeſty unprovided, who had raiſed another gallant Army under the command of the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> as chief Generall, and the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> as the chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der under him; himſelf with all ſpeed poſting towards the <hi>North,</hi> as ſoon as the News of this invaſion had been brought unto him. But ſcarce was he well ſetled in the head of his Army, but he was followed by a Petition from ſome Lords of <hi>England,</hi> confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable in the main points of it to a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30218:41"/>
Declaration of the <hi>Scots,</hi> which they called <hi>the Intention of their Army.</hi> So that the Cloud which gathered behind him in the <hi>South,</hi> threatned more danger to him then the <hi>Northern</hi> Tempeſt, which blew directly in his teeth.</p>
               <p>Sailing thus between <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis,</hi> it concerned him to ſteer as even a courſe as he could, and thereupon he ſummoned the great Councel of his Peers to attend him at <hi>York,</hi> that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in this great buſineſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their advice, he might give himſelf the better hopes of their aſſiſtance, as his occaſions ſhould require. By their advice Commiſſioners are appointed to treat with the <hi>Scots,</hi> to underſtand their Grievances, the reaſonableneſſe or unreaſonableneſſe of their Demands, and finally to make up the breach by ſuch an Accommodation as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the peace and happineſſe of both Kingdomes, and his Majeſties honour.</p>
               <p>In the mean time he calls a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to begin at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the third
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30218:42"/>
day of <hi>November</hi> then next following, which if it had been held at <hi>York,</hi> as lying neareſt to the danger and Scene of action, might not have proved ſo fatall and deſtructive to him as it after did.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Parliament, he caſt himſelf on the love and loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, in which he found himſelf deceived of his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the firſt thing they did, was to deprive him of the Counſels of the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and thereby to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie all others from adhering to him in the times of his greateſt need. Theſe they impeacht of High Treaſon, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them from the Houſe of Peers, and committed them to the <hi>Tower of London,</hi> where the Archbiſhop ſtaid four years before any particular charge, or any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution upon that charge, was brought againſt him. But with the Lord <hi>Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> they made quicker work, inviting the People of all the three Kingdomes to bring them in ſuch
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30218:42"/>
matter as they had or could deviſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and having made all things ready for a publick Tryal, they brought him to the Bar before the Peers, ſitting in <hi>VVeſtminſter-Hall</hi> on the ſixth of <hi>April</hi> then next following; but he ſo rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaded in his own behalf, and ſo fully ſatisfyed all objections which were made againſt him, that the Commons were fain to deſiſt from the Courſe which they had begun, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt him in a Bill of <hi>Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better paſſing whereof the Commons framed a <hi>Protestation</hi> on the third of <hi>May,</hi> in many things not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the <hi>Scotiſh Covenant</hi> before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, by which they bound themſelves among other things, <hi>to maintain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Power and Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the lawfull Rights and Liberties of the Subject, to endeavour to bring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne puniſhment all ſuch as ſhall either by Force, Practice, Plots, Counſels and Conſpiracies, or otherwiſe, do any thing to the contrary</hi>; (amongſt which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30218:43"/>
they reckon the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> to be one) <hi>and finally to ſtand unto one another, and to every other perſon whatſoever in any thing he ſhall do in purſuance of the ſaid Protestation.</hi> Which Proteſtation being firſt taken by themſelves, was the next day taken alſo by the Houſe of Peers, and not long after obtruded on all the reſt of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But not finding this ſufficient to effect their purpoſe, they firſt forced the Lords by Tumults, and afterwards the King by their importunities to paſſe that unhappy Bill of <hi>Attainder</hi>; which having obtained, they brought him to the Scaffold on Tower-Hill on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>May,</hi> where with as much Chriſtian confidence and magnanimity as could be expreſt by fleſh and blood, he delivered up his neck to the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>In order to this great work which they knew the <hi>Scots</hi> much laboured for, and had declared ſo much in a Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let called <hi>The intentions of their Army,</hi> at their firſt coming into <hi>England,</hi> the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30218:43"/>
men in the houſe of Commons held a ſtrict correſpondency with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners then reſiding in <hi>London,</hi> and voted no leſſe then three hundred thouſand pounds (by the name of a <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Aſsistance</hi>) to be given to the <hi>Scots</hi> in generall, under colour of repairing ſuch damages as they had ſuſtained in the time of this breach, but in plain truth to bind them faſt unto themſelves. And having made ſure work with them, they deprived the King by little and little of almoſt all the ancient and undoubted prerogatives which of right belonged unto his Crown.</p>
               <p>The power of calling Parliaments, in caſe of his neglect or refuſall, is put into the hands of Sheriffs and Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; his right to <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> muſt be diſclaimed by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the <hi>Bill</hi> of the <hi>Attainder</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and that for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this Parliament during the pleaſure of the Houſes, are extorted by tumults. And by the terrour of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:30218:44"/>
like, the Act for <hi>Knighthood</hi> is repealed, and the impoſition for ſhip-money con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as an illegall Tax, and aboliſhed alſo. The like Acts paſſed againſt the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Clerk of the Market, the Court of <hi>Stanneries,</hi> his propriety in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gun-powder, the authority of the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> the Courts of <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> and <hi>High Commiſsion,</hi> the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Eccleſiaſticall Courts, as alſo the Preſidiall Courts held for a long time in <hi>York</hi> and the Marches of <hi>VVales.</hi> And finally, that he might loſe both his ſtrength in Parliament, and his power with the People, they extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the paſſing of two Acts, the one for taking away the Biſhops Votes and place in the Houſe of Peers, the other for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of his power in preſſing Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers (enjoyed by all his Predeceſſors) for defence of his Perſon and the Realm.</p>
               <p>And that they might the better awe the King to their Conceſsions, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>Scots</hi> muſt be maintained
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30218:44"/>
with pay and plunder, till there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nothing left for them to crave, or the King to grant. But being at the laſt ſent home, his Majeſty followed not long after to ſettle his affairs in that bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken kingdom; where to oblige that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, he confirmed not onely all his former conceſsions by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but all ſuch things alſo as had been acted by them in their Aſſembly held at <hi>Glaſco.</hi> And more then ſo, he parted with ſo much of his Eoyall Prerogative (invaded &amp; uſurped by them in the late Confuſions) that he had allmoſt nothing left remaining to him, but the empty title, the having of a Sword carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and ſome other outward pomps of Court, which ſignifie juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when the power is gone.</p>
               <p>This good ſucceſſe of the <hi>Scots</hi> encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> to attempt the like, and to attempt it in the ſame way as the <hi>Scots</hi> had gone; that is to ſay, by ſeizing his Towns, Forts, and Caſtles, putting themſelves into the body of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30218:45"/>
an Army, baniſhing or impriſoning all ſuch as oppoſe their practiſes, and then petitioning the King for a publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Religion. The 23. of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctober Anno</hi> 1641. was the day deſigned for the ſeizing of the City and Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and many places of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the Kingdom. But failing in the main deſign which had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the night before by one <hi>Oca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelle,</hi> they break out into open arms, dealing no better with the Proteſtants there then the <hi>Covenanters</hi> had done with the Royall party in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this Rebellion (for it muſt be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Rebellion in the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> though not in the <hi>Scots</hi>) the King gives preſent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to his Houſes of Parliament, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their counſel and aſſiſtance for the extinguiſhing of that flame before it had waſted and conſumed that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But neither the neceſſity of the Proteſtants there, nor the Kings impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity here, could perſwade them to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie one man towards the ſuppreſſion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30218:45"/>
of thoſe Rebels, till the King had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his power of preſſing ſouldiers in an Act of Parliament, and thereby laid himſelf open to ſuch acts of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as were then hammering againſt him. Which having done, they put an army of <hi>Scots</hi> (their moſt aſſured Friends) into the Northern parts of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> delivering up into their hands the ſtrong Town and Port of <hi>Carickfergus,</hi> one of the chief keys of that Kingdom; and afterwards ſent a ſmall body of <hi>Engliſh</hi> to preſerve the South, which <hi>Engliſh</hi> forces having done notable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice there againſt the Rebels, were kept ſo ſhort both in reſpect of pay and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries by the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (who had made uſe of the mony raiſed for the relief of <hi>Ireland</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a War againſt their King) that they were forced to come to a <hi>Ceſſation,</hi> and cheerefully returned home again to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the King in that juſt War which he had undertaken for his own defence. The ground and occaſion of which War we are next to ſhew.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:30218:46"/>At ſuch time as he was in <hi>Scotland</hi> and expoſtulated with ſome of the chiefs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, touching their coming into <hi>England</hi> in an hoſtile manner, he found that ſome who were now leading men in the Houſes of Parliament had invited them to it. And having furniſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſome proofs for it, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Attorney Generall to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach ſome of them of high Treaſon; that is to ſay, the L. <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Houſe of Peers, Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Strode,</hi> of the Houſe of Commons. But ſending his Serjeant at Arms to arreſt their perſons, there came a countermand from the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by which the Serjeant was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from doing his office, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers had the opportunity of putting themſelves into the Sanctuary of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The next day, being the 4. of <hi>January,</hi> his Majeſty being no otherwiſe attended then with his ordinary Guard, went to the Houſe of Commons to demand the five Members of that Houſe, that he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:30218:46"/>
might proceed againſt them in a way of juſtice; but his intention was diſcovered, and the birds flown before his coming.</p>
               <p>This was voted by the Commons for ſuch an inexpiable breach of priviledge, that neither the Kings qualifying of that Action, nor his deſiſting from the proſecution of that impeachment, nor any thing that he could either ſay or do, would give ſatisfaction. Nothing muſt ſatisfie their <hi>jealouſies</hi> and ſecure their <hi>fears,</hi> but the putting of the <hi>tower of London</hi> into their hands, together with the command of the Royal Navie, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo all the Forts, Caſtles, and the Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands of the Kingdome, all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the name of the <hi>Militia</hi>; which if his Majeſty would fling after all the reſt, they would continue his moſt loyall ſubjects. On this the King demurs a while, but having ſhipt the Queen for <hi>Holland,</hi> and got the Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own power, he becomes more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and ſtoutly holds on the denyal.</p>
               <p>Finding the Members too ſtrong for him, and <hi>London,</hi> by reaſon of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:30218:47"/>
continuall Tumults, to be a dangerous neighbour to him, he withdraws to <hi>York,</hi> that being in a place of ſafety, he might the better find a way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe differences which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to embroil the kingdome. At <hi>Hull</hi> he had a Magazine of arms and ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition provided for the late intended war againſt the Scots, and laid up there when the occaſion of that War was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. Of this Town he intended to poſſeſſe himſelf, and to make uſe of his own Arms and Ammunition for his own preſervation; but coming before the gates of the Towne, he was denyed entrance by Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> who by the appointment of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons had took charge of that place.</p>
               <p>The Gentry of <hi>York-ſhire</hi> who had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned the King to ſecure that <hi>Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin,</hi> became hereby more firmly united to him. The like had been done alſo by the Yeomandry, and thoſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour ſort, if his proceedings had not been undermined by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of four Gentlemen, all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

of the Houſe, and all of them Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of that Countrey, ſent thither purpoſely (in a new and unprecedent, way) to lie as Spies upon his Counſels, and as controllers to his actions.</p>
               <p>Some Meſſages there were betwixt him and the Houſes of Parliament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the attoning of theſe differences, whilſt he was at <hi>York.</hi> But the XIX Propoſitions ſent thither to him, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſufficiently that there was no peace to be expected on his part, unleſſe he had made himſelf a cypher, a thing of no ſignification in the <hi>Arithmetick</hi> of State.</p>
               <p>And now the War begins to open. The Parliament had their Guards alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Affront which <hi>Hotham</hi> had put upon his Majeſty at <hi>Hull,</hi> prompted the Gentlemen of <hi>York-ſhire</hi> to tender themſelves for a Guard to his Perſon. This preſently voted by both Houſes to be a leavying of War againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for whoſe defence, not onely the Train-bands of <hi>London</hi> muſt be in readineſſe, and the good people of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30218:48"/>
the countrey required to put themſelves into a poſture of armes; but Regiments of <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Foot</hi> are liſted, a Generall appointed, great ſummes of Money rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and all this under pretence of taking the King out of the hands of his evil Counſellours.</p>
               <p>The noiſe of theſe preparations haſtens the King from <hi>Yorke</hi> to <hi>Notingham,</hi> where he ſets up his <hi>Standard,</hi> inviting all his good Subjects to repair unto him, for defence of their King, the Lawes and Religion of their Countrey. He increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Forces as he marched, which could not come unto the reputation of an Army, till he came into <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> where great bodies of the loyall and ſtout-hearted <hi>Welch</hi> reſorted to him.</p>
               <p>Strengthened with theſe, and furniſht ſufficiently with Field Pieces, Armes and Ammunition, which the Queen had ſent to him out of <hi>Holland,</hi> he reſolves upon his march towards <hi>London</hi>; but

               <p>Each part pretended to the victory, but it went clearly on the Kings ſide, who though he loſt his Generall, yet he kept the Field, and poſſeſſed himſelf of the dead bodies; and not ſo onely, but he made his way open unto <hi>London,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Aſſoon as ſhe had well paſſed over the weakneſſes and infirmities incident to Child-bed, ſhe committed the young Princeſſe to the Lady <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sir <hi>Edward Villiers,</hi> one of the half Brothers of the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>

               <p>And to ſay truth, her Removall from <hi>Oxford</hi> was not onely ſeaſonable, but exceeding neceſſary at that time, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and Sir <hi>William W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the King underſtanding of this diviſion, thought himſelf able enough to deal with <hi>Waller,</hi> and giving him the go by, returned towards Oxford, drew thence the remainder of his Army, and gave him a ſharp meeting at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cropredy bridge,</hi> where he obtained a ſignal victory on the twenty eighth of <hi>June,</hi> and entred triumphantly into <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> This done he marched after the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who had made himſelf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of ſome places in the Weſt of good importance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:30218:55"/>During this march, it happened that one of the Carriages brake in a long narrow lane which they were to paſſe, and gave His Majeſty a ſtop at a time of an intollerable ſhower of rain which fell upon him: Some of his Courtiers, and others which were neere about him, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to hew him out a way through the hedges with their ſwords, that he might get ſhelter in ſome of the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges adjoyning; but he reſolved not to forſake his Canon upon any occaſion. At which when ſome about him ſeemed to admire, and marvelled at the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience which he ſhewed in that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, His Majeſty lifting up his Hat, made anſwer, <hi>That as God had given him Afflictions to exerciſe his patience, ſo he had given him patience to bear his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</hi> A ſpeech ſo heavenly and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that it is hardly to be paralell'd by any of the men of God in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>The carriage being mended, he went forward again, and trode ſo cloſe upon the heels of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that at
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:30218:56"/>
laſt he drave him into <hi>Cornwell,</hi> and there reduced him to that point, that he put himſelf into a Cock-boat with Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton</hi> and ſome others, and left his whole army to his Majeſties mercy. His Horſe taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a dark night, made a ſhift to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, but the Commanders of the Foot came to this capitulation with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that they ſhould depart without their Arms, which with their Canon, Baggage and Ammunition, being of very great conſideration, were left wholly to his diſpoſing.</p>
               <p>Immediately after this ſucceſſe, his Majeſty diſpatch'd a meſſage from <hi>Tave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stock</hi> to the two houſes of Parliament, in which he laid before them the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of the Kingdome; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring them of thoſe many meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which he had formerly ſent unto them, for an accommondation of the preſent Differences; and now deſiring them to be think themſelves of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient by which this iſſue of blood might be dried up, the diſtraction of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:30218:56"/>
the Kingdom ſetled, and the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put into an hope of Peace and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>To which Meſſage, as to many others before, they either gave no anſwer, or ſuch an one as rather ſerved to widen, than cloſe the breach, falſely conceiving that all his Majeſties Offers of Grace and Favour proceeded either from an inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to hold out the War, or from the weakneſſe and irreſolution of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. So that the <hi>Trage-Comedy</hi> of the <hi>two Harlots</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Kings,</hi> may ſeem to have been acted over again on the Stage of <hi>England.</hi> The King, like the true Mother, compaſſionately deſired that the life of the poor infant might be preſerved; the Houſes, like the falſe Mother, conſidering that they could not have the whole, <hi>voted</hi> that it ſhould be neither <hi>mine</hi> nor <hi>thine,</hi> but divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them.</p>
               <p>But if inſtead of this Meſſage from <hi>Taveſtock,</hi> his Majeſty had gone on his own errand, and marched with his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:30218:57"/>
Army towards <hi>London,</hi> it was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that in all probability he might have made an end of the War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Army of <hi>Eſſex</hi> being thus broken, and that of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> not returned from the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern ſervice. But ſitting down before <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and ſtaying there to perfect an Aſſociation of the Weſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he ſpent ſo much time, that <hi>Eſſex</hi> was again in the head of his Army; and being ſeconded by the Earl of <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and Sir <hi>William VValler,</hi> made a ſtand at <hi>Newbery,</hi> where after a very hot fight, with variable ſucceſs on both ſides, each party drew off by degrees, ſo that neither of them could find cauſe to boaſt of the victory.</p>
               <p>Winter comes on, which though it be not ordinarily a time of Action, will notwithſtanding afford us ſome variety which will not be unworthy of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. And firſt, a Garriſon is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at <hi>Abington,</hi> (a Town within five miles of <hi>Oxford</hi>) by order from the two Houſes of Parliament, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Colonell <hi>Brown</hi>; the King and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:30218:57"/>
Councill looking on, and ſuffering the Intrenchments to be made, the Works to be raiſed, and the Ordnance to be planted on the ſame.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denyed, but that Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ge,</hi> Governour at that time of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and many of the chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which were then in and about that City, offered their ſervice to the King, and earneſtly deſired leave to prevent that miſchief which by the Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Town muſt needs fall upon them. But the Lord <hi>George Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> not long before made principall Secretary of Eſtate, had perſwaded the King unto the contrary, upon aſſurance that he held intelligence with <hi>Brown</hi> and that as ſoon as the Town was fortified and furniſhed with Victuall, Arms and Ammunition, at the charges of the Houſes of Parliament, it would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately be delivered into His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties hand. In which deſign he was out-witted, and conſequently expoſed unto ſome loſſe of reputation with all ſorts of People. For <hi>Brown</hi> having
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:30218:58"/>
brought his project to the <hi>highest round of the ladder</hi> (as himſelf expreſſed it) thought it high time to turn it off, and to declare himſelf for the two Houſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King; printing not long after all the Letters which paſſed between him and the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> upon this ocaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>After this followed the taking of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> a place of very great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the King, as the Gate which opened into <hi>Wales,</hi> ſituate on a riſing ground, and almoſt encompaſſed round about by the river <hi>Severn</hi>; that part which is not invironed by water, being wholly taken up and made good by a very ſtrong Caſtle. By the loſs of which Town the Kings former entercourſe with His loyall Subjects of <hi>North-Wales</hi> was not onely hindred, but a preſent ſtop was given to an Aſſociation, which was then upon the point of concluding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Counties of <hi>Salop, Flint, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Worceſter,</hi> &amp;c. to the great prejudice of the Kings Affairs in thoſe Parts of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:30218:58"/>Then comes the lamentable death of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> kept for four years a priſoner in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> as before was ſaid; but reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved onely as a bait to bring in the <hi>Scots,</hi> whenſoever the Houſes ſhould have occaſion for their ſecond coming; as formerly on the like temptation they had drawn them in, with reference to the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> The Scots being come, and doing good ſervice in the North, it was thought fit they ſhould be gratified with that blood which they ſo greedily thirſted after. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Archbiſhop being voted guilty of High Treaſon by the Houſe of Commons, was condemned to die in ſuch a ſlender Houſe of Lords, that onely ſeven (<hi>viz.</hi> the Earls of <hi>Kent, Pembroke, Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Bullingbrook,</hi> the Lords <hi>North, Gray</hi> and <hi>Brewes,</hi>) were preſent at the paſſing of the ſentence of his condemnation. Which being paſt, he was brought unto the Scaffold on Tower-hill on the tenth of <hi>January,</hi> where he ended his life with ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:30218:59"/>
confidence, and ſo much piety, that his greateſt enemies then preſent, who came to behold the Execution with hearts full of joy, returned back with eyes as full of tears.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, comes another Treaty ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by the King conſented to by the Houſes with no ſmall difficulty, and that upon condition to have the Treaty held at <hi>Uxb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idge,</hi> a Town about fifteen miles from <hi>London,</hi> and more then twice as much from <hi>Oxford.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto which appointment the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners met on the thirtieth of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> accompanied with ſome Divines, for debating the point of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, when it came in queſtion. But this Treaty proved as unſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as that at <hi>Oxford</hi> had done before; the Commiſsioners for the Houſes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering no expedient for an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor hearkening unto ſuch as were tendred to them in the name of the King. So that there being no hope of bringing the Warre unto an end
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:30218:59"/>
this way, both parties were reſolved to proceed in the other.</p>
               <p>The King having wintered his Army at <hi>Oxford</hi> and the Towns adjoyning, it was thought fit to ſend the Prince into the Weſt to perfect the Aſſociation which had been begun in the end of the laſt ſummer; and in thoſe Countries to advance ſuch further forces as might not onely ſerve for the defence of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but give ſome reaſonable increaſe to His M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the beginning of <hi>April</hi> he ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards <hi>Briſtol,</hi> accompanied with the Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> as his principall Counſellours, and ſome of the chief Gentry of the Weſt, who were of moſt authority in their ſeverall Countreys.

                  </gap>tel of <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> which much retarded his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; and hearing afterwards that Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> with his victorious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was marching towards him, he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:30218:60"/>
quitted <hi>Somerſet-ſhire,</hi> and drew more Weſtward into the middle of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Briſtol</hi> being taken, and his Majeſties affairs growing worſe and worſe, both there and elſewhere, he ſent a Meſſage unto <hi>Fairfax,</hi> deſiring a ſafe conduct for the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> to go to the King and mediate with him for a Treaty with the Parliament. To which, after a fortnights deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he receives an anſwer the eight of <hi>November</hi> to this effect, That if he would disband his Army, and apply himſelf unto the Parliament, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall himſelf in perſon would conduct him thither.</p>
               <p>No hopes of doing good this way, and leſſe the other, <hi>Exeter</hi> being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, and <hi>Barnſtable</hi> taken by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies forces, he leaves his Army to the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> and withdraws into the Dukedome of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> But finding that Countrey unable to protect him long, he paſſeth into the Iſle of <hi>Scilly,</hi> and from thence unto the Queen his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:30218:60"/>
Mother, whom he found at <hi>Paris,</hi> not doubting but to receive ſuch entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that Court, as might be juſtly looked for by the eldeſt Son of a Daughter of <hi>France.</hi> Which paſſages I have laid together in this place, that I might follow his Majeſties affairs elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where with the leſs interruption.</p>
               <p>The Prince being gone for <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> as before is ſaid, his Majeſty reſolved on the approch of Summer, to relieve ſuch of his Northern Garriſons; as had been left untaken the year before, and from thence to beſtow a viſit on the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated Counties. But being on his march, and having ſtormed the Town of <hi>Leicester</hi> in his way, he returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſo far as <hi>Daventry,</hi> upon the news that Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> newly made Generall in the place of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> was ſate down before <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning which we are to know, that not long after the beginning of this everlaſting Parliament, the <hi>Puritan</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:30218:61"/>
Faction became ſubdivided into <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi>; of which the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> at the firſt carryed all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. The <hi>Independents</hi> growing up by little and little, and being better ſtudied in the arts of diſſimulation, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily undermined the others, and outed their Lord-Generall, and all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded under him, of their ſeverall places, under colour of an Ordinance for <hi>Self-denyall.</hi> That done, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that command on Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> a man of more Precipitation then Prudence, not ſo fit for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell as Execution, and better to charge on an Enemy then command an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. With him they joyned Collonel <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> (whom they diſpenſed with in the point of <hi>ſelf-denyall</hi>) by the name of Lieutenant General; but ſo that he diſpoſed of all things as Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chief, and left <hi>Fairfax</hi> to his old trade of Execution, to which he had been accuſtomed.</p>
               <p>The like alteration happened alſo in the Kings Army; Collonel Sir <hi>Patrick
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:30218:61"/>
Ruthen,</hi> a man of approved valour and Fidelity, being by his Majeſty made Earl of <hi>Forth</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was on the death of the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> made the Lord Lieutenant of his Armies; and the next year made Earl of <hi>Brentfort,</hi> for the good ſervice he had done in that place. Having both fortunately and faithfully diſcharged that office for two years and more, he was outed of his place by a Court-contrivement made in the favour of Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> who a little before Chriſtmas laſt was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Generalliſſimo</hi> of his Majeſties For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: which he moſt ambitiouſly aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto, and at laſt obtained, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his late defeat at <hi>Marſton-Moor,</hi> his ſquandring away ſo brave an army, and his apparent want of Age, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Moderation for ſo great a truſt.</p>
               <p>By theſe new Generals the fortune of the War, and the whole eſtate of the Kingdome, which lay then at ſtake, came to be decided. For <hi>Fairfax</hi> hearing that the King was come back as far as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:30218:62"/>
                  <hi>Daventry</hi> (which was the matter he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired) made directly towards him, with an intent to give him battel, and at a place neer <hi>Naſeby</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> the two Armies met on Saturday the 14. of <hi>June.</hi> The King had the better at the firſt, but Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> having routed one wing of the enemies Horſe, followed the chace ſo unadviſedly, that he left the foot open to the other wing; who preſſing hotly on them, put them to an abſolute rout, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of his Camp, Carriage and Canon, and amongſt other things, of his Majeſties Cabinet, in which they found many of his Letters, moſt of them written to the Queen, which were after publiſht with little honour to them that did it. For whereas the <hi>Athenians</hi> on the like ſucceſſe had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted a packet of Letters from <hi>Philp</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> their moſt bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, unto ſeverall friends, all the reſt of thoſe Letters being broke open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Common Council of <hi>Athens,</hi> one of which was ſubſcribed to the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:30218:62"/>
Queen <hi>Olympias,</hi> was returned untoucht; the whole Senate thinking it a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diſhoneſt act to diſcover and betray the Conjugall ſecrets betwixt man and wife. A modeſty in which thoſe of <hi>Athens</hi> ſtand as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Helladius Biſantinus,</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writer, as the chief leading men of the Houſes of Parliament are like to ſtand condemned for the want of it in ſucceeding Hiſtories.</p>
               <p>But we return unto the King; who having ſaved himſelf by flight, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together ſome part of his ſcattered Forces, but never was able to make head againſt the conquerors; loſing one place after another, till his whole ſtrength was almoſt reduced to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſome few Garriſons adjoyning. I ſhall take notice onely of ſome of the principal, <hi>viz. Chester, Conway, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Briſtol,</hi> and <hi>Exeter,</hi> on which ſo great a part of his affairs did moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially depend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:30218:63"/>
                  <hi>Cheſter</hi> firſt comes within the danger, a City of great importance in thoſe parts of the Kingdom. To the relief of this place then beſieged by Sir <hi>William Brereton,</hi> Collonel <hi>Jones,</hi> and others of that party, and at that time brought to ſome diſtreſſe, he made all the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſpeed he could; but was purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the way, and charged in front by the beſiegers, betwixt whom this ſmall Army was routed at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bauton-Heath,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Bernard Stuart</hi> (newly created Earl of <hi>Lichfield</hi>) killed upon the place; the laſt of three brethren that had loſt their lives in their Princes quarrell.</p>
               <p>On this diſcomfiture, the King draws towards the North-Eaſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his Horſe to march for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and there to joyn with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Montroſſe,</hi> who with ſmall ſtrengths had acted Miracles in that Kingdome. But at a Village in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> called <hi>Sherbourn</hi> (a fatall name, but pointing to another place) where he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized 700 of the Parliaments Foot, he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:30218:63"/>
he was ſet upon by Collonel <hi>Cotly,</hi> his Forces made drunk with the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the day very eaſily maſtered, and he himſelf compelled to fly into <hi>Ireland,</hi> never returning ſince that time to his Native Country.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the Kings miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune before mentioned, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on the twenty ninth of <hi>September</hi>; the Lord <hi>Byron,</hi> who had the command of the Garriſon in <hi>Cheſter,</hi> held it out gallantly till the firſt of <hi>February</hi>; and then perceiving that there was no hopes of any Succour, came to an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble compoſition, and gave up the Town, the greateſt part of the Countrey falling into the ſame condition with their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City.</p>
               <p>Before we leave the North-weſt parts, we muſt look upon the fortune of the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Conway,</hi> a place of principall Command on that narrow Channell which runneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the County of <hi>Carnarvon</hi> and the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Angleſey.</hi> Before this Town, being then beſieged by Collonel <hi>Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:30218:64"/>
came Doctor <hi>John Williams,</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord Keeper of the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and at that time Arch-biſhop of <hi>York:</hi> Who to ingratiate himſelf with the Houſes of Parliament, and to ſave the charges of compounding for Delinquency, came with ſome forces to the aid of the Beſiegers (ſome ſay in Armour) and encamped there till the place was taken; to the Amazement of the world and the eternall infamy and Reproch of his Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Briſtol</hi> comes next, a place conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſeated for the Trade of <hi>Spain,</hi> the River capable of great Ships, and the port well guarded. At the taking of this City by the Kings Forces, to ſuch ſtrengths as before it had, there was added a Fort Royall (as they called it) then conceived impregnable; into this City Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> (who had ſpent there too much of the year before) had put himſelf at the preſent, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged not long after by Sir <hi>Thomas Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi> who came before it on the twenty fourth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and had it ſurrendred
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30218:64"/>
to him without any memorable reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, together with the old Caſtle and Royall Fort, on the thirteenth of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The quick ſurrendry of which place, being ſo well fortified and furniſht with victuall, Arms and Ammunition, and the weak defences which were made to preſerve the ſame, created ſome ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of diſloyalty in Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King his Uncle. There had before paſſed ſome Letters betwixt the King and him, touching the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a ſpeedy agreement with his Houſes of Parliament, in which the King was preſt ſo far, that he ſeemed to be diſpleaſed at it.

               <p>Nor were the Lords of the Council leſſe amazed at the news then his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was, who thereupon, when Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and his Brother <hi>Maurice</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Oxford,</hi> commanded them to be diſarmed, and would not ſuffer them to walk the ſtreets with their Swords by their ſides, as they had done for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; though afterwards by the Kings great goodneſſe, they were reſtored to all apparences of favour, though not to any ſpeciall places of Command or Truſt.</p>

of the whole Army of Sir <hi>Thomas Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi> who laid ſiege unto it, diſpoſed the Lords of the Council, and ſuch of the principall Gentry who had the conduct of the Affair, to come to a ſpeedy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> in the meane time being

deſirous to make even with their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> to receive the <hi>wages</hi> of their <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and to get home in ſafety, with that ſpoil and plunder which they had gotten in their marching and remarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt <hi>Tweed</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> had not the patience to attend the leiſure of any more voluntary ſurrendries They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſſed the King to give order to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormond</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to all the Governours of his Garriſons in <hi>England,</hi> to give up all the Towns and Caſtles which remained untaken, to ſuch as ſhould be appointed to receive them for the Houſes of Parliament, aſſuring him that otherwiſe they neither could nor durſt continue him in their protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>To this neceſſity he ſubmitted, but found not ſuch a generall obedience to his commands as the <hi>Scots</hi> expected.

For beſides many victories of leſſe conſequence, he had twice bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Marqueſſe of <hi>Argile</hi> out of the field, followed him home, and waſted his Countrey with Fire and Sword. He vanquiſht <hi>Baily,</hi> one of the beſt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Faction, commanding over a well-formed Army in a ſet battell fought between them; followed his blow, and made himſelf Maſter of the City and Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing divers of his Friends who had been ſeized and impriſoned there when he firſt took Arms.

perfected, but aſſured the conqueſt of that Kingdome.

               <p>Theſe Obſtacles removed, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty conceived ſome thoughts of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sanctuary in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Scots
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:30218:68"/>
having firſt aſſured him, (as he ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Letter to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond)</hi> before he put himſelf into their hands, that they would not onely take his perſon, but ſo many of his party al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as repaired unto him, into their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and ſtand to him with their lives and fortune. According to which hopes on his part, and thoſe aſſurances on theirs, he had a great mind to return to his Native Countrey, his <hi>Ancient and Native Kingdome,</hi> as he uſed to call it, there to expect the bettering of his condition in the changes of time.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Scots</hi> hearing of his purpoſe, and having long ago caſt off the yoke of Subjection, voted againſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them in a full Aſſembly; ſo that we may affirm of him as the Scripture doth of Chriſt our Saviour, <hi>viz. He came unto his own, and his own recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him not.</hi> The like reſolution alſo was entertained by the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of that Nation, and the chiefe Leaders of their Army, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:30218:69"/>
with the <hi>Houſes</hi> of Parliament, and for the ſumme of two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds in ready money, ſold and betrayed him into the hands of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as certainly they would have done with the Lord Chriſt himſelf for halfe the money, if he had <hi>bowed the Heavens and came down to viſit them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Commiſſioners ſent from the Houſes to receive him, he was condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>Holdenby</hi> a fair houſe of his own, and one of the goodlieſt Piles in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſcituate not far from <hi>Naſeby,</hi> (to the intent that he might be continually grieved with the ſight of the fatall place of his overthrow) but kept ſo cloſe that none of his Domeſtick ſervants, no, not ſo much as any of his own Chaplains were ſuffered to have Acceſſe unto him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time a breach began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party in both Houſes and ſome chief Officers of the Army, which growing every day wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and wider, one Cornet <hi>Joice,</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:30218:69"/>
with a conſiderable party of Horſe, was ſent to ſeize on his Majeſties Perſon, and bring him ſafe to their head Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. There at the firſt he was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with all poſſible demonſtrations of Love and Duty, ſome of his Chaplains licenſed to repair unto him, and read the Book of Common-Prayer, as in former times, and the way open to all thoſe of his party who deſired to ſee him.</p>
               <p>This made the Animoſities between thoſe of the two Houſes and the Army to be far greater then before, the City cloſing with that party of the Houſes which deſired the Kings coming to the Parliament, and going down in a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous manner required the preſent voting of a Perſonal Treaty. This made the Speaker and ſuch of both Houſes, as either held for the Army, or had no mind to ſee the Kings Return to <hi>London,</hi> to quit the Parliament, and to betake themſelves to their Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; incouraged wherewith they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon their march towards <hi>London,</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:30218:70"/>
to reſtore thoſe members to their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and thoſe Houſes to the Power and Freedom of Parliaments. Upon the noiſe of whoſe Approach, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens who before ſpake big, and had begun to raiſe an Army, under the Command of the Lord <hi>Willowby</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſent their Petitions for a peace, and gladly opened all their works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Hide-Park</hi> Corner and the <hi>Thames,</hi> to make an entrance for the Army; who having placed their Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in their ſeverall Chaires, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt thoſe of the oppoſite party, made a triumphant paſſage through the chief Streets of the City, with Trumpets ſounding, Drums beating, and Colours flying.</p>
               <p>The King removed from one place to another, was brought in the courſe of thoſe Removes to <hi>Caſam</hi> Lodge, an Houſe of the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> not far from <hi>Reading,</hi> where he obtained the favour of giving a meeting to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at <hi>Maydenhith,</hi> and there they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together; the Generall willingly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:30218:70"/>
conſenting, and the Houſes then not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to make any denyall.</p>
               <p>From thence he was at laſt brought to his own Palace of <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> where being terrified with the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of ſome Dangers, which were given out to be deſigned againſt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the <hi>Agitators,</hi> who for a time much governed the lower part of the Army, he left that place, accompanied onely with two or three of his ſervants, and put himſelf unfortunately into the power of Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi> in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> where no relief could come unto him.</p>
               <p>Being ſecured in <hi>Carisbrook Caſtle,</hi> Propoſitions are ſent to him from the Houſes of Parliament, as had been done before at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and <hi>Holden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by-Houſe</hi>: to which he returned the ſame Anſwer now as he did before, their Demands being nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and his condition nothing worſe then before it was. Provoked wherewith, the Houſes paſt their <hi>Votes</hi> of <hi>Non-Addreſſes</hi> to his Majeſty,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:30218:71"/>
and take the Government upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as in the times of <hi>

               <p>During the time of theſe reſtraints, he betook himſelf to meditation, and then compoſed that moſt excellent Book entituled <gap reason="foreign">

But it is well known to all that knew him, that his Majeſty had alwayes a fine ſtroke with his pen, which he practiſed at all times of leaſure and receſſe from buſineſſe, from before his coming to the Crown, to theſe laſt extremities. By which means he became Maſter of a pure and elegant Stile, as both his intercepted

The iſſue of which Siege was this, that after ſome extremities endured by the beſieged, the place was yielded upon compoſition, the Townſmen to be ſafe from plunder, the Souldiers and their Commanders to yield themſelves
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:30218:75"/>
Priſoners abſolutely without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. The Principal of theſe were the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle,</hi> all of them of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved valour and fidelity: of which the two laſt were ſhot to death upon the place, the firſt reſerved for the Scaffold; on which he lookt death in the face with as much magnanimity, as <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> (who ſuffered at the ſame time with him) entertained it with a poorneſs and Dejection of Spirit.</p>
               <p>And which was worſt (becauſe it loſt ſome Reputation to the Prince in his firſt Attempt) the Marriners grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcontented that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was appointed to be their Admirall, inſtead of the Lord <hi>VVilloughby</hi> of <hi>Parham,</hi> by whom they deſired to be commanded, fell off with many of their Ships, and returned again to their old Admirall the Earl of <hi>VVarwick.</hi> By the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which Ships he was rendred the leſſe able to do any thing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the Sea, and landing with ſome

Forces neer <hi>Deal</hi>-Caſtle in <hi>Kent,</hi> ſped not ſo fortunately as both his Friends hoped and himſelf expected.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding theſe Succeſſes, the Houſes ſeeing how deſirous the whole Nation was of a Perſonall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, recalled their <hi>Votes</hi> of <hi>No-Addreſs,</hi> and ordered that a Perſonall Treaty ſhould be held with his Majeſty at <hi>Newport</hi> in the <hi>Iſle of VVight,</hi> to begin on the eighteenth day of <hi>September</hi> next following. But the Commiſſioners which were ſent to mannage this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſpent ſo much time upon each <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Punctillio</hi> of the Propoſitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they drew towards a Concluſion, that they gave the Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my too much opportunity to frame and publiſh a <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> bearing date at S. <hi>Albans</hi> on the ſixteenth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> In which it was declared that the King was the ſole cauſe of all that blood-ſhed which had been made in the Kingdome, that he was incapable of any further truſt in the publick go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:30218:76"/>
and that nothing could be more expedient to the ſafety of the Common-wealth, then to bring him to the Bar of Juſtice. Nor ſtaid they there, but in purſuit of this Deſign, ſome of the Officers were appointed to go into the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> and having ſeized upon his Perſon to bring him over to <hi>Hurſt</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> from whence they brought him by degrees to <hi>VVind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> and at laſt to <hi>VVeſtminster.</hi> And on the other ſide, the <hi>Independent</hi> Party in the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> (holding intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with the Army) voted his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Conceſſions to be ſo unſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that no well-grounded Peace could be built upon them.</p>
               <p>In the next place, a care was taken by the Army to purge the Houſe of all thoſe members to whom his Majeſties condeſcenſions had given ſatisfaction. Which done, a New Court, called the <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> is to be ſet up, a Preſident of the ſame appointed, certain Commiſſioners nominated to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:30218:76"/>
Act as Judges, and a ſet time deſigned to call his Majeſty to a Tryall, in an unprecedented way, before his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>It is reported that at his going from the <hi>Bar,</hi> one of the Souldiers moſt barbarouſly ſpit in his face, and uſed very reproachfull words againſt him. Which though his Majeſty ſuffered with his wonted patience, yet the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vengeance would not ſuffer it to go unrevenged; that wretch being not long after condemned in a Court of War, for ſome endeavours to make a Mutiny in the Army, and openly ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to death in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard.</p>
               <p>And now Saturday the 20 of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the day of his appearing being come, his Majeſty was brought from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Saint <hi>James</hi> unto <hi>VVeſtminſter Hall,</hi> to appear before the new Judges, and anſwer unto all particulars which are thought fit to be objected.</p>
               <p>His appearance could not be avoided, in regard he was under a conſtraint;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:30218:77"/>
but no conſtraint could force his will to make him acknowledge their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or ſubmit himſelf unto their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He would not ſo betray the Liberty of the Engliſh Subject (as he plainly told them) to any arbitrary and lawleſſe Power, as he muſt needs do by ſubmitting unto their proceedings; and therefore ſince the Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Land were now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, he ſtood reſolved to dy a Martyr for them both. For which contempt (having ſtood reſolutely on the ſame term, as oft as he was brought before them) he was ſentenced on Saturday the twenty ſeventh of the ſame moneth to loſe his life, by the dividing of his head from his body.</p>
               <p>That fatall morning being come, the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who attended on him in that ſad exigent, read the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Prayers, and for the firſt Leſſon thereof, the 27 Chapter of S. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, relating the Hiſtory of our Saviours Sufferings under <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:30218:77"/>
by the practiſe of the chief Prieſts, the Scribes and Phariſees, and others of the <hi>Great Council</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation. At firſt his Majeſty conceived that the Biſhop had made choice of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, as being very agreeable to his preſent condition; But when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that it was the Chapter which the Church had appointed for that day in her publick <hi>Kalendar,</hi> he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to apprehend it with ſome ſignes of rejoycing.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had he done his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but he is hurried to <hi>VVhite-Hall,</hi> out of the Banqueting-houſe, whereof a way was forced to a <hi>Seaffold</hi> on which he was to act the laſt part of his <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> in the ſight of the people. Having declared that he died a Martyr for the Lawes of this Kingdome, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Subjects, he made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Faith, inſinuating that he died a true Son of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he betook himſelf to his private Devotions, and patiently ſubmitted that Royal Head to an Executioner, which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:30218:78"/>
had before been crowned with ſo much outward Pomp and Splendour.</p>
               <p>The Members of both Houſes had often promiſed him in their Petitions, Meſſages and Declarations, that they would make him a <hi>great and glorious King,</hi> and now they were as good as their words, changing his fading but painfull <hi>Crown of Thorns,</hi> which they firſt <hi>platted</hi> for him, to an <hi>immarceſsible Crown of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At his firſt coming to the Crown, one of his Chaplains in Ordinary, and now a Biſhop in this Church, taking good heed unto the cloſe contrivances of ſome, and the ſeditious actings of others in his two firſt Parliaments, thought fit to give him and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſuch an <hi>item</hi> of it, as might awaken them to prevent thoſe miſchiefs which otherwiſe might enſue upon it. And thereupon he preached before them on theſe words of S. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, <hi>viz, But when the husbandmen ſaw the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:30218:78"/>
Son, they ſaid among themſelves, This is the heir, come let us kill him, and let us ſeize on his inheritance,</hi> Mat. 21.38. In the diſſecting of which Text, he made ſuch an Anatomy of the Husbandmen, whom he had in hand (with reference to ſome Plots and Practiſes which were then on foot) and his whole diſcourſe upon the ſame, that he gave the King and thoſe about him ſuch Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, as might make them have an eye unto themſelves and the publick ſafety. But then withall (though he carried on the matter with great care and prudence) he drew ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on himſelf from ſome leading Members in the ſecond Parliament, who thought themſelves as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Sermon as the chief Prieſt and Phariſees did in the Parable, that he was upon the point of leaving the Kingdome, when he had news that his Majeſty had diſſolved the ſecond Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in no ſmall diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>What he then preached concerning
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:30218:79"/>
the ſaid Husbandmen, was after practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that he then fore-ſignified was accompliſhed now. Which ſhewes him to have been both a Prieſt and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, if at the leaſt the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet may be given unto any man who foretelleth not of things to come by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, but out of a deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>But we return unto the King, whom if we looke on in his Children (the moſt lively Images and Repreſentations of deceaſed Parents) we ſhall find him to have been the Father of four Sons and five Daughters.</p>

In which Battel, though he acted beyond the expectation of his Friends, and to the great applauſe of his very Enemies; yet it ſo pleaſed the Divine Providence that he loſt the day, and being miraculouſly preſerved (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the diligent ſearch which was made after him) he paſſed ſafely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into <hi>France</hi> to the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

ſoon as he is once full he begins to <hi>howl,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>howling</hi> fit fell at this time on the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> They had carried on this Tragedy to the very laſt Act from the firſt bringing in of the Scots to the beginning of the war, and from the beginning of the war till they had brought him priſoner into <hi>Holmby-Houſe,</hi> and then quarrelled with the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> for taking the work out of their hands, and robbing them of the long-expected fruits of their Plots and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes.

               </p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Independents,</hi> who had waſht their hands in the blood of the King, ſeemed as deſirous as the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to <hi>waſh their hands of it.</hi> By them it was alledged more calmly, that they had put <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> to death, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom they had proceeded as the

ſole cauſe of ſo much bloodſhed; but that the King had been murthered a long time before by the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> when they deprived him of his Crown, his Sword and his Scepter; of his Crown, by forcing from him thoſe Prerogatives which placed him in a Throne of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above his People; of his Sword, by wreſting the Militia out of his hands, by which he was made unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them; and finally, of his Scepter, in diveſting him of the power of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Parliaments, and of his <hi>Negative voice</hi> in making thoſe Laws by which he was to govern all eſtates of men under his Dominion. And more then ſo, that they had deprived him of his naturall Liberty, as he was a Man, of the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Wife, as he was a Husband, of converſation with his Children, as he was a Father, of the attendance of his Servants, as he was a Maſter, and in a word, of all thoſe comforts which might make life valued for a Bleſſing.

Calamities, into which this miſerable man, this <hi>vir dolorum</hi> (as he might very well be called) had been ſo accurſedly plunged by the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
