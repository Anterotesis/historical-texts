            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>TEdious have been our Fasts, and long our Prayers;</l>
               <l>To keep the Sabbath such have been our cares,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Cisly</hi> durst not milk the gentle <hi>Mulls,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To the great damage of my Lord Mayors Fooles,</l>
               <l>Which made the greazie Catchpoles swear and curse</l>
               <l>The Holy-day for want o'th'second course;</l>
               <l>And men have lost their body's new adorning</l>
               <l>Because their cloathes could not come home that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</l>
               <l>The sins of Parlament have long been bawl'd at,</l>
               <l>The vices of the City have been yawl'd at,</l>
               <l>Yet no amendment; Certainly, thought I,</l>
               <l>This is a Paradox beyond all cry.</l>
               <l>Why if you ask the people, very proudly</l>
               <l>They answer straight, That they are very godly.</l>
               <l>Nor could we lawfully suspect the Priest,</l>
               <l>Alas, for he cry'd out, <hi>I bring you Christ:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And trul' he spoke with so much confidence,</l>
               <l>That at that time it seem'd a good pretence:</l>
               <l>Then where's the fault? thought I: Well, I must know,</l>
               <l>So putting on clean cuffs, to Church I go.</l>
               <l>Now 'gan the Bells to jangle in the Steeple,</l>
               <l>And in a row to Church went all the People.</l>
               <l>First came poor Matrons stuck with Lice like Cloves,</l>
               <l>Devoutly come to worship their white loaves;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96986:3"/>And may be smelt above a German mile,</l>
               <l>Well, let them go to fume the Middle-Ile.</l>
               <l>But here's the sight that doth men good to see't,</l>
               <l>Grave Burghers, with their Posies, sweet, sweet, sweet,</l>
               <l>With their fat Wives. Then comes old <hi>Robin</hi> too,</l>
               <l>Who although write or read he neither do,</l>
               <l>Yet hath his Testament chain'd to his wast,</l>
               <l>And his blind zeal feels out the proofs as fast,</l>
               <l>And makes as greasie Dogs-ears as the best.</l>
               <l>A new shav'd Cobler follows him, as it hapt,</l>
               <l>With his young <hi>Cake-bread</hi> in his cloak close wrapt;</l>
               <l>Then panting comes his Wife from t'other end</l>
               <l>O'th' Town, to hear Our Father and see a friend;</l>
               <l>Then came the shops young fore-man, 'tis presum'd,</l>
               <l>With hair rose-water'd, and his gloves perfum'd,</l>
               <l>With his blew shoo-strings too, and besides that,</l>
               <l>A riband with a sentence in his hat:</l>
               <l>The Virgins too, the fair one, and the Gypsie,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Spectatum veniunt, venient spectentur ut ipsae</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And now the silk'n Dames throng in, good store,</l>
               <l>And casting up their noses to th' pew dore,</l>
               <l>Look with disdain to see the pew so full,</l>
               <l>Yet must and will have room, I, that they wull;</l>

               <l>One takes; 'Tis fine that I must be displac't</l>
               <l>By you, she cries then, Good <hi>Mistris Gill Flurt</hi>;</l>

               <l>Surely your Husband's but a Scavenger;</l>
               <l>Cries t'other then, and what are you I pray?</l>
               <l>No Aldermans wife for all you are so gay.</l>
               <l>Is it not you that to all Christenings frisk it?</l>
               <l>And to save bread, most shamefully steal the bisket,</l>
               <l>At which the other mad beyond all law,</l>
               <l>Unsheaths her talons, and prepares to claw.</l>
               <l>And sure some gorgets had been torn that day,</l>

               <l>
                  <note place="margin">Nothing beyond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</note>And truly Brother, there's no man can prove</l>
               <l>That I was ere ingratefull for his love;</l>
               <l>But sometimes Angels did attend his Purse,</l>
               <l>At other times I did him duly nurse</l>
               <l>With many a secret dish of lusty meat,</l>
               <l>Which did enable us to do the feat.</l>
               <l>Truly quoth <hi>Dorcas</hi> then, I saw a Vision,</l>
               <l>That we should have our foes in great derision.</l>
               <l>Quoth <hi>Martha</hi> straight, (and then she shook the crums</l>
               <l>From off her apron white, and pickt her gums)</l>
               <l>So did I too; methought I went a Maying,</l>
               <l>And the Word of the <hi>Laud</hi> came to me, saying,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Martha</hi> put off thy cloaths, for time is come,</l>
               <l>That men may <hi>bauble</hi> shew, and women <hi>bum,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For that the seed of them that do <hi>profess,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Shall only need be cloath'd with Righteousness.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:96986:12"/>'Tis true dear Sister, there are some that now</l>
               <l>Are come to this perfection, and I trow</l>
               <l>We may in time grow up to be as they,</l>
               <l>Grant us, <hi>ah Laud,</hi> that we may see that day;</l>
               <l>Let's ith' mean time at home and eke abroad,</l>
               <l>Uncloath and unbrace our selves before the Laud,</l>
               <l>On all occasions that time shall yield,</l>
               <l>That our dear Sisters dream may be fulfill'd.</l>
               <l>Why did not <hi>Iacob</hi> dream, and so it was;</l>
               <l>And <hi>Pharoah</hi> dreamt, and so it came to pass.</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Dorcas</hi> cry'd, reach me the Cheese up hither;</l>
               <l>Sister, quoth she, give this unto our Brother,</l>
               <l>'Tis very good, if well wash'd down with Sack,</l>
               <l>His wasted spirits much refreshing lack.</l>
               <l>Recruited thus, All this good chear, quoth he,</l>
               <l>Is but an Emblem of Mortality.</l>
               <l>The Oxe is strong, and glories in his strength,</l>
               <l>Yet him the Butcher knocks down, and at length</l>
               <l>We eat him up. A Turkey's very gay,</l>
               <l>Like worldly people clad in fine array;</l>
               <l>Yet on the Spit it looks most piteous,</l>
               <l>And we devour it, as the Worms eat us.</l>
               <l>Then full of sawce and zeal up steps <hi>Elnathan,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>[This was his name now, once he had another,</l>
               <l>Untill the Ducking-pond made him a Brother]</l>
               <l>A Deacon and a Buffeter of Sathan:</l>
               <l>Truly,<note place="margin">A man may love his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</note> quoth he, I know a Brother dear,</l>
               <l>Would gladly pick the bones of what's left here;</l>
               <l>Nay he would gladly pick your pockets too</l>
               <l>Of a small two pence, or a groat, or so,</l>
               <l>The sorry remnants of a broken shilling;</l>
               <l>Therefore I pray you friends be not unwilling.</l>
               <l>As for my self, 'tis more than I do need,</l>
               <l>To be charitable both in word and deed;</l>
               <l>For as to us, the holy Scriptures say,</l>
               <l>The Deacons must receive,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>but</hi>
                  </note> the Lay-men pay.</l>
               <l>Why Heathen folks that do in Taverns stray,</l>
               <l>Will never let their friends the reckning pay;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:96986:13"/>And therefore pour your charity into the bason,</l>
               <l>Brethren and Sisters eke, your coats have lace on.</l>
               <l>Why Brethren in the Lord, what need you care</l>
               <l>For sixpence? we'll next morn enhance our ware:</l>
               <l>Your sixpence comes again, nay there comes more;</l>
               <l>Thus Charity's th' encreaser of your store.</l>
               <l>Truly well spoke, then cry'd the Master-feaster,</l>
               <l>Since you say so, I freely give my tester:</l>
               <l>But for the women, they gave more liberally,</l>
               <l>For they were sure to whom they gave, and why.</l>
               <l>
                  <note place="margin">Not better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note>Then did <hi>Elnathan</hi> blink, for he knew well</l>
               <l>What he might give, and what he might conceal.</l>
               <l>But now the Parson could no longer stay,</l>
               <l>'Tis time to kiss, he cryes, and so away:</l>
               <l>At which the Sisters, once th' alarum taken,</l>
               <l>Made such a din as would have serv'd to waken</l>
               <l>A snoring Brother, when he sleeps at Church;</l>
               <l>With bagg and baggage then they 'gan to march;</l>
               <l>And tickled with the thoughts of their delight,</l>
               <l>One Sister to the other bids Good night.</l>
               <l>Good night, quoth <hi>Dorcas</hi> to <hi>Priscilla</hi>; she,</l>
               <l>Good night dear Sister <hi>Dorcas</hi> unto thee.</l>
               <l>In these goodly good nights much time was spent,</l>
               <l>And was it not a holy complement?</l>
               <l>
                  <note place="margin">Christian Liberty.</note>At length in steps the Parson, on his breast</l>
               <l>Laying his hand, A happy night of rest</l>
               <l>Refresh thy labours, Sister; yet ere we part,</l>
               <l>Feel in my lips the passion of my heart.</l>
               <l>To another straight he turn'd his face, and kist her,</l>
               <l>And then he cryes, <hi>All peace be with thee Sister.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Next her that made the Feast he kisses harder,</l>
               <l>
                  <note place="margin">Ne're a prophane kiss among all these.</note>And in a Godly tone, cryes, <hi>God reward her</hi>:</l>
               <l>And having done, he whispers in her ear,</l>
               <l>The time when it should be, and the place where.</l>
               <l>Thus they all part, and for that night the Priest</l>

               <l>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:96986:13"/>When Satan chain'd below should cease to roar,</l>
