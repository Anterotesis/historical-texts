            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Rough Draught
OF A
NEW MODEL
AT
SEA.</head>
            <p>I Will make no other Introduction to
the following Discourse, than that
the Importance of our being strong at
Sea, was ever very great, so in our present
Circumstances it is grown to be much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
because, as formerly, our Force in Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
contributed greatly to our Trade and
Safety. So now it is become indispensibly
necessary to our very being.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61205:3"/>
It may be said now to <hi>England,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,
Martha, <hi>thou art busie about many things,
but one thing is necessary</hi> to the Question,
What shall we do to be saved in this
World? There is no other answer, but
this, Look to your <hi>Mote.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Article of an English-man's
Political Creed, must be, That he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in the Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without that, there
needeth no General Council to pronounce
him incapable of Salvation here.</p>
            <p>We are in an Island, confined to it by
God Almighty, not as a Penalty, but a
Grace, and one of the greatest that can
be given to Mankind. Happy Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that hath made us Free, Rich, and
Quiet; a fair Portion in this World, and
very well worth the preserving; a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
that ever hath been envied, and
could never be imitated by our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
Our Scituation hath made Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
abroad by Land Conquests unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things to us. It is true, we have made
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61205:3"/>
Excursions, and Glorious ones too, which
make our Names great in History, but
they did not last.</p>
            <p>Admit the <hi>English</hi> to be Giants in
Courage, yet they must not hope to
succeed in making War against Heaven,
which seemeth to have enjoined them to
acquiesce in being happy within their
own Circle. It is no Paradox to say
that <hi>England</hi> hath its Root in the Sea,
and a deep one too; from whence it
sendeth its Branches into both the <hi>Indies.</hi>
We may say further in our present Case,
That if Allegiance is due to Protection,
ours to the Sea is due from that Rule,
since by that, and by that alone, we
are to be protected; and if we have of
late suffered Usurpation of other Methods
contrary to the Homage we owe to
that which must preserve us. It is time
now to restore the Sea to its Right; and
as there is no Repentance effectual without
amendment, so there is not a moment to
be lost in the going about it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61205:4"/>
It is not pretended to launch into
such a voluminous Treatise, as to set
down every thing to which so compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
a Subject might lead me; for as
the Sea hath little less variety in it
than the Land; so the Naval Force of
<hi>England</hi> extendeth its self into a great
many Branches, each of which are impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
enough to require a discourse apart,
and peculiarly applied to it. But there
must be a preference to some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
above others, when the weight of
them is so visibly Superior that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be contested. It is there first that the
Foundations are to be laid of our Naval
Oeconomy; amongst these there is one
Article which in its own nature must be
allowed to be the Corner-Stone of the
Building, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Choice of Officers, with the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
and Encouragement belonging to
them. Upon this Head only I shall then
take the liberty to venture my opinion
into the World, with a real submission to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61205:4"/>
those who may offer any thing better
for the advantage of the publick.</p>
            <p>The first Question then will be, out of
what sort of Men the Officers of the
Fleet are to be chosen; and this imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
leadeth us to the present Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
between the Gentlemen and the
Tarpaulins.</p>
            <p>The usual Objection on both sides, are
too general to be relied upon. Partiality
and common Prejudices direct most Mens
Opinions, without entring into the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
reasons which ought to be the ground
of it: There is so much ease in aquiescing
in Generals, that the Ignorance of those
who cannot distinguish, and the Largeness
of those who will not, maketh Men very
apt to decline the trouble of stricter En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
which they think too great a Price
for being in the right, let it be never so
valuable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61205:5"/>
This maketh them judge in the Lump,
and either let their Opinions swim along
with the Stream of the World, or give them
up wholly to be directed by success:
The effect of this is that they change
their Minds upon every present uneasiness,
wanting a steady Foundation, upon which
their judgment should be formed. This
is a pearching upon the Twiggs of things,
and not going to the Root: But sure
the Matter in question deserveth to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
in another manner, since so much
dependeth upon it.</p>
            <p>To state the thing impartially, it must
be owned that it seemeth to lie fairest
for the Tarpaulin: It giveth an Impression,
that must have so much weight as to make a
Mans Opinion lean very much on that
side, it carrieth so much Authority with it, it
seemeth to be so unquestionable that those
are fittest to command at Sea, who have
not only made it their Calling, but their
Element; that there must naturally be a
prejudice to any thing that can be said
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61205:5"/>
against it: There must therefore be some
reason very extraordinary to support the
argument on the other side, or else
the Gentlemen could never enter the
Lists against such a violent Objection,
which seemeth not to be resisted. I
will introduce my Argument with an
assertion, which as I take to be true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in all Cases, so it is necessary to
be explained and enforced in this. The
assertion is, That there is hardly a single
Proposition to be made, which is not
deceitful, and the tying our Reason too
close to it, may in many cases be
destructive. Circumstances must come
in, and are to be made a part of the matter
of which we are to judge; positive Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are always dangerous, more especially
in Politicks. A Man who will be Master
of an Argument, must do like a skilful
General, who sendeth Scouts on all sides
to see whether there may not be an
Enemy. So he must look round to see
what Objections can be made, and not
go on in a streight Line, which is the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61205:6"/>
ready way to lead him into a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.</p>
            <p>Before then that we conclude what sort
of Men are fittest to command at Sea, a
Principle is to be laid down, that there is
a differing Consideration to be had of
such a subject-matter as is in it self di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
and independent, and of such a one,
as being a Limb of a Body, or a Wheel
of a Frame, there is a necessity of suiting
it to the rest, and preserving the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the whole: A Man must not
in that case restrain himself to the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Consideration of that single part,
but must take care it may fall in and
agree with the shape of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of which it is a Member. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this Proposition, which I take
to be indisputable, it will not, I hope, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
an Affectation or an extravagant Fit
of unseasonable Politicks, if, before I
enter into the particular state of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Question, I say something of the
Government of <hi>England,</hi> and make that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61205:6"/>
the ground-work of what sort of Men are
most proper to be made use of to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
at Sea.</p>
            <p>The Forms of Government to which
<hi>England</hi> must be subjected, are either Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Monarchy, a Commonwealth, or a
Mixed Monarchy, as it is now; with those
natural Alterations that the exigency of
Affairs may from time to time suggest.
As to absolute Monarchy, I will not allow
my self to be transported into such Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives
as are generally made against it;
neither am I ready to enter into the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating-stile
of calling every thing
Slavery, that restraineth Men in any part
of their Freedom; One may discern in
this, as in most other things, the good and
the bad of it: We see by too near an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
what <hi>France</hi> doth by it; it doth
not only struggle with the rest of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
but is in a fair way of giving Law
to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61205:7"/>
This is owing in great measure to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotick
and undivided Power; the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
Authority of the directive
Counsels maketh every thing move without
Disorder of Opposition, which must give
an advantage that is plain enough of it
self, without being proved by the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Experience we have of it at this
time.</p>
            <p>I see and admire this; yet I consider at
the same time, that all things of this kind
are Comparative; that as on one side,
without Government Men cannot enjoy
what belongeth to them in particular, nor
can a Nation secure or preserve it self in
general; so on the other side, the end of
Government being, that Mankind should
live in some competent state of Freedom,
it is very unnatural to have the end de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by the means that were original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made use of to attain it. In this
respect something is to be ventured rather
than submit to such a precarious state of
Life as would make it a burthen to a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61205:7"/>
reasonable Creature; and therefore after I
have owned the advantages in some kind
of an unlimitted Government, yet whilst
they are attended with so many other
discouraging Circumstances, I cannot
think but they may be bought too dear;
and if it should be so, that it is not
possible for a State to be Great and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
except the Subjects are wretchedly
miserable. I am ashamed to own my low-spirited
frailty, in preferring such a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of Government as may agree with
the reasonable enjoyment of a Free Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
before such a one by which Empire
is to be extended at such an unnatural
price. Besides, whatever Mens opinions
may be one way or another, in the
general Question, there is an Argument
in our Case that shutteth the Door to
any Answer to it, <hi>(viz.)</hi> We cannot
subsist under a Despotick Power, our very
Being would be destroyed by it; for
we are to consider, we are a very little spot
in the Map of the World, and make a
great Figure only by Trade, which is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61205:8"/>
the Creature of Liberty; one destroyed,
the other falleth to the ground by a
natural consequence, that will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a dispute. If we should be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by our Acres, we are poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
People; we are exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
our Natural bounds, by our good
Laws, and our excellent Constitution.
By this we are not only happy at home,
but considerable abroad: Our Scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
our Humor, our Trade, do all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
to strengthen this Argument. So
that all other Reasons must give place
to such a one as maketh it out, That
there is no mean between being a Free
Nation, and no Nation.</p>
            <p>We are no more a People, nor <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
can no longer keep its name from the
<hi>Moment,</hi> that our Liberty are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisht;
the vital strength that should
support us, being withdrawn. We should
then be no more than the Carcass of a
Nation, with no other security than that of
Contempt, and to subsist upon no other
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61205:8"/>
Tenure, than that we should be below
the giving temptation to our stronger
Neighbours to devour us. In my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therefore, there is such a short de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
to be made upon this Subject,
that in relation to <hi>England,</hi> an Absolute
Monarchy is an unreasonable thing to
be wished, as I hope it will be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ever to be obtained.</p>
            <p>It must be considered in the next
place, Whether <hi>England</hi> likely is to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a Commonwealth. It is hard at
any time to determine what will be the
shape of the next Revolution, much more
at this time would it be inexcuseably
arrogant to undertake it. Who can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
whether it will be from without or
from within, or from both? Whether
with or without the Concurrence of
the People? Whether regularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
or violently imposed? I shall not
therefore Magisterially declare it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that a Commonwealth should be
setled here; but I may give my humble
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61205:9"/>
opinion, that according to all appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
it is very improbable.</p>
            <p>I will first lay it down for a Principle,
That it is not a sound way of arguing
to say, That if it can be made out, that
the Form of a Commonwealth will best
suit with the Interest of the Nation, it
must for that reason of necessity prevail.</p>
            <p>I will not deny but that Interest will
not lye, is a right Maxim, where-ever it is
sure to be understood; else one had as
good affirm, That no Man in particular,
nor Mankind in general, can ever be
mistaken. A Nation is a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can see, and generally they
must feel first before their Sight is quite
cleared: This maketh it so long before
they can see their Interest, that for the
most part it is too late for them to
pursue it: If Men must be supposed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to follow their true Interest, it must
be meant of a new Manufactory of
Mankind by God Almighty; there must
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61205:9"/>
be some new Clay, the old Stuff never
yet made any such infallible Creature.</p>
            <p>This being premised, it is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
Whether instead of inclination
or a leaning toward a Commonwealth,
there is not in <hi>England</hi> a general dislike
to it; if this be so, as I take it to be,
by a very great disparity in numbers,
it will be in vain to dispute the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whilst Humor is against it, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the weight that is due to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
which may be alledged for it;
yet if the Herd is against it, the going
about to convince them would have no
other effect than to shew, That nothing
can be more impertinent than good
Reasons, when they are misplaced or
ill-timed.</p>
            <p>I must observe that there must be some
previous Dispositions in all great Changes
to facilitate and to make way for them;
and I think it not at all abused to affirm,
that such resolutions are seldom made at
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61205:10"/>
all, except by the general preparations of
Mens Minds, they are half made before
it is plainly visible that Men go about
them.</p>
            <p>Tho' it seemeth to me, that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alone maketh all others unnecessary,
yet I must take notice, that besides what hath
been said upon this Subject, there are
certain Preliminaries to the first building
a Commonwealth; some materials abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary for the carrying on such
a Fabrick, which are at present wanting
amongst us, I mean Vertue, Morality,
Diligence, Religion, or at least Hypocrisie.
Now this Age is so plain dealing, as not
to dissemble so far as to an outward
pretence of Qualities which seem at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
so unfashionable, and under so much
Discountenance.</p>
            <p>From hence we may draw a plain and
natural Inference, That a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
is not fit for us, because we are
not fit for a Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61205:10"/>
This being granted, the Supposition of
this form of Government of <hi>England,</hi> with
all its Consequences to the present Question,
must be excluded, and absolute Monarchy
having been so too by the reasons at once
alledged, it will without further Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
fall to a Mixt Government, as we
now are: I will not say that there is never
to be any alteration; the constitution of
the several Parts that concurr to make up
the frame of the present Government, may
be altered in many things, in some for
the better, and in others perhaps for the
worse, according as Circumstances shall
arise to induce a Change; and as Passion
and Interest shall have more or less Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon the publick Councils: but still
if it remaineth in the whole so far a Mixt
Monarchy, that there shall be a restraint
upon the Prince, as to the exercise of
a Despotick Power, it is enough to make
it a ground-work for the present Question.
It appeareth then, that a bounded Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
is that kind of Government which
will most probably prevail and continue
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61205:11"/>
in <hi>England;</hi> from whence it must follow
(as hath been hinted before) that every
considerable part ought to be so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
as the better to conduce to the
preserving the harmony of the whole
Constitution. The Navy is of so great
importance, that it would be disparaged
by calling it less than the Life and Soul
of Government.</p>
            <p>Therefore to apply the Argument to
the Subject we are upon, in case the
Officers should be all Tarpaulins, it would
either be in reality, or at least it would
be thought too great a tendency to a
Commonwealth; such a part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
being Democratically disposed,
may be suspected to endeavour to bring
it into that shape; and where the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
must be so strong, the supposition
will be the more justifiable: In short, if
the Maritim Force, which is the only
thing that can defend us, should be
wholly directed by the lower sort of
Men, with an entire exclusion of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61205:11"/>
Nobility and Gentry, it will not be easie
to answer the Arguments supported by
so great a Probability, that such a Scheme
would not only lean toward a <hi>Democracy,</hi>
but directly lead us into it.</p>
            <p>Let us now examine the contrary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>viz.</hi> That all Officers should be
Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>Here the Objection lieth so fair of
its introducing an Arbitrary Government,
that it is as little to be answered in that
respect, as the former is in the other.
Gentlemen in a general definition will
be suspected to lie more than other Men
under the temptations of being made
Instruments of unlimitted Power; their
Relations, their way of Living, their taste
of the Entertainments of the Court, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
an Ambition that generally draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
their inclinations toward it, besides
the gratifying of their Interests. Men
of Quality are often taken with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of Government; the Splendor
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61205:12"/>
dazleth them so, as that their Judgments
are surprized by it; and there will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
some, that have so little remorse
for invading other Men's Liberties, that
it maketh them less sollicitous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their own.</p>
            <p>These things throw them naturally
into such a Dependance as might give
a dangerous Byass: if they alone were
in Command at Sea, it would make
that great Wheel turn by an irregular
Motion; and instead of being the chief
means of preserving the whole Frame,
might come to be the chief Instruments to
discompose and dissolve it.</p>
            <p>The two former exclusive Propositions
being necessarily to be excluded in this
Question, there remaineth no other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient;
neither can any other Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
be drawn from the Argument as
it hath been stated, than that there must
be a mixture in the Navy of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Tarpaulins, as there is in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61205:12"/>
Constitution of the Government, of
Power and Liberty. This mixture is
not to be so rigorously defined, as to
set down the exact Proportion there is
to be of each; the greater or less number
must be directed by Circumstances, of
which the Government is to judge, and
which makes it improper to set such
Bounds, as that upon no occasion it
shall on either side be lessened or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.
It is possible the Men of <hi>Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi>
may think they are injured by
giving them any Partners in the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Sea; they may take it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly
to be Jostled in their own Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Men of such a different Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that they may be said to be of
another Species; they will be apt to
think it an Usurpation upon them; and
notwithstanding the Instances that are
against them, and which give a kind
of Prescription on the other side, they
will not easily acquiesce in what they
conceive to be a hardship to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61205:13"/>
But I shall in a good measure recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
my self to them by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;
(<hi>viz.</hi>) The Gentlemen shall not
be capable of bearing Office at Sea,
except they be Tarpaulins too; that is
to say, except they are so trained up by
a continued habit of living at Sea, that
they may have a right to be admitted
free Denizons of <hi>Wapping.</hi> Upon this
dependeth the whole matter, and indeed
here lieth the difficulty; because the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
brought up under the connivance
of a looser Discipline, and of an easier
Admittance, will take it heavily to be
reduced within the Fetters of such a new
Model; and I conclude they will be
extreamly averse to that, which they will
call an <hi>Vnreasonable Yoke</hi> upon them,
that their Original Consent is never to
be expected. But if it appeareth to be
convenient, and which is more, that it
is necessary for the preservation of the
whole, that it should be so, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must be called in Aid to suppress
these first boylings of Discontent; the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61205:13"/>
Rules must be imposed with such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and the Execution of them must
be so well supported, that by degrees
their Impatience will be subdued, and
they will concurr in an Establishment,
to which they will every day be more
reconciled.</p>
            <p>They will find it will take away the
Objections which are now thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, of setting up <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Masters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having ever been Apprentices; or
at least, without having served out their
time.</p>
            <p>Mankind naturally swelleth against Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Partiality; their belief of their
own Merit maketh Men object them to
a prosperous Competitor, even when
there is no pretence for it; but where
there is the least handle offered, to be
sure it will be taken. So in this Case,
when a Gentleman is preferred at Sea,
the Tarpaulin is very apt to impute it
to Friend or Favour: But if that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61205:14"/>
hath before his preferrment passed
through all the Steps, which ought to
lead to it; that he smelleth as much of
Pitch and Tarr as those that were swadled
in a Sail-cloth; his having a Scutcheon
will be so far from doing him harm,
that it will set him upon the advantage
Ground: It will draw a real respect to
his Quality when so supported, and give
him an Influence and an Authority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
superior to that which the meer
Seamen can ever pretend to.</p>
            <p>When a Gentleman hath learned how
to Obey, he will grow very much fitter
to Command; his own Memory will
advise him not to exact unreasonable
things; and for smaller faults, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
too rigorous punishments: He will
better resist the Temptations of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
(which are great) when he reflecteth
how much he hath at other times wished
it might be gently exercised, when he
was liable to the rigor of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61205:14"/>
When the undistinguisht discipline of
a Ship hath tamed the young Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which is apt to arise from a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
Birth and Education, he then
groweth proud in the right place, and
valueth himself first upon knowing his
Duty, and then upon doing it.</p>
            <p>In plain English, Men of Quality in
their several Degrees, must either restore
themselves to a better opinion both for
Morality and Diligence, or else Quality
it self will be in danger of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished.</p>
            <p>The Original Gentleman is almost lost
in Strictness, when Posterity doth not
still further adorn by their Vertue: The
Scutcheon their Ancestors first got for
them by their Merit, they deserve the
penalty of being deprived of it.</p>
            <p>To expect that Quality alone should
waft Men up into Places and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is as unreasonable, as to think
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61205:15"/>
that a Ship, because it is Carved and
Gilded, should be fit to go to Sea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sails or Tackling. But when a
Gentleman maketh no other use of his
Quality, than to incite him the more
to do his Duty, it will give such a
true and settled Superiority, as must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all Competition from those that
are below him.</p>
            <p>It is time now to go to the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
Qualifications of an Officer at
Sea; and I have some to offer, which
I have digested in my thoughts, I hope
Impartially, that they may not be Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Notions, but things easie and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable,
if the directing Powers will
give due countenance and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the execution of them: But
whilst I am going about to set them
down, tho' this little Essay was made
to no other end, than to introduce them,
I am, upon better recollection, induced
to put a restraint upon my self, and
rather retract the Promise I made at
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61205:15"/>
the beginning, than by advising the
particular Methods, by which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the good end that is aimed at
may be obtained, to incurr the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the thing of the World, of
which I would least be guilty, which is,
of anticipating by my private opinion,
the Judgment of the Parliament, or seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of my slender stock of Reason,
to dictate to the Supream Wisdom of
the Nation. They will, no doubt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the present Establishments for the
Discipline at Sea, which are many of
them very good, and if well executed,
might go a great way in the present
Question. But I will not say they are
so perfect, but that others may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to make them more effectual, and
that some more Supplemental Expedients
may be necessary to compleat what is
yet defective; and whenever the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
shall think fit to take this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into their Consideration, I am sure
they will not want for their direction
the Auxiliary Reasons of any Man
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61205:16"/>
without doors, much less of one whose
Thoughts are so intirely and unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
resigned to whatever they shall
determine in this or any thing else re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Publick.</p>
