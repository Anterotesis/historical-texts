            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

nothing but an higher degree t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
to be the worthy object of her vows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:108482:10"/>
Thus whilſt Love was getting
ground more and more in the heart
of <hi>Berenice</hi> for her truly beloved
<hi>Lyſandre,</hi> (ſuch is the name of that
fortunate Gentleman) our Major
was very earneſt with her about
getting a favourable declaration,
growing every day more forward
to tell his mind, and fancying,
that loves paſſion increaſed as much
in that inſenſible heart, as in his
own; Nay, he came to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of familiarity, that he fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquainted her with ſome ſecret
intrigues which ſome other kind
Ladies had truſted to his ſuppoſed
fidelity and diſcretion; ſo that,
through ſo ſimple and giddy a carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
he diſcovered to that refined
Maid, the weakneſs of his Soul,
making her conceive great hopes
of conſiderable things, ſhe could
get by him, and in effect, it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not a miſtake, ſince through the
indiſcretion of that ſilly conceited
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108482:11"/>
wooer, ſhe ſurpriſed and fixed to
her ſide the fickleneſs of fortune; all
ſucceeded according to her deſires,
and ſhe got benefits far beyond her
own expectation. One day, after
he had ſpent a whole afternoon in
a private and pleaſant converſation
with her, he took opportunity of
the merry humour ſhe was in, to
throw again at her feet both his
heart and liberty, being in hope of
a favourable anſwer: but the crafty
Lady not willing, either to put him
in a deſpair, or to ingage herſelf
further than was agreeable to her
deſigns, keeping ſtill in a merry
tune; one will think on it, ſaith
ſhe with a jeering manner, the
injoyment of a heart, that may
love ſincerely when it hath no more
choice, is worth enough ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
Such a cold anſwer was able
to ſatisfie our Gallant of the little
tendency of his Miſtriſs towards him
(for how true and faithful may be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108482:11"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat love which is not natural
and true) but the great opinion he
had of himſelf did blind him ſo
much that he was by no means
diſcountenanced. Nay, he made
his court with more exactneſs than
ever, growing more troubleſome
and impatient than formerly: In
fine, he deſired her to take a final
and ſubſtantial reſolution upon the
matter. She who had little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the ordinary frailty of her
Sex, ſeeing there was no way to
avoid anſwering to ſo formal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
reparteed wittily, ſhe
was extreamly ſenſible of his love,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut that how great ſoever her reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
paſſion for him might be, yet
her being Daughter of a famous
Colonel, which quality was almoſt
her only inheritance did forbid her
to follow her own inclination, and
yield to a Gentleman inferiour to
the degree of her late father: that
the place of Lieutenant Colonel
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108482:12"/>
being void, he could eaſily attain
to it, and then ſhe would ſtick
no longer to reward and ſecond his
Vows.</p>
            <p>This declaration caſt into a
ſtrange perplexity of mind our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,
who had ſeveral times made
his utmoſt intereſt, but always in
vain, to get that preferment. He
wanted no acceſs to his Colonel,
who was a man near fourſcore
years of age, but who being grown
gray-haired in the exerciſe of War,
and having got through a long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
a deep diſcernment and
a ſolid apprehenſion of true cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
prudent conduct, and other
warlike parts, did not judge his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite
to be able enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
worthily a place of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
a truſt. Nevertheleſs, he
ſet a good face on a bad matter,
and replyed cheerfully, That he
was not very far off from that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
degree, there being but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108482:12"/>
one ſtep more to be made to it:
but if ſo be her fire were equal to
his flame, ſhe ſhould not ſtop their
common happineſs on ſo ſmall an
account, and for want of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
quality, which could neither
increaſe nor diminiſh his real and
material merit. <hi>Berenice</hi> at that
onſet, ſtood firm upon a noble
pride, ſhe obſtinately bent herſelf
to perſwade him, ſhe loved the
Major, and would marry the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Colonel; which having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
ſeveral times, what reaſons
ſoever he could alledge to move
her, he perceived clearly, that the
taking in of ſuch a Fortreſs was
not a matter of one day, nor ſo
eaſie a work as he thought; but
being gone ſo far, his love and
courage did not permit him to
make retreat: he reneweth the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
with more vigour and freſh
arguments, ſighs, crieth, intreats,
but is always ſerved with the ſame
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108482:13"/>
anſwer, ſo that giving himſelf
wholly to ſorrow, his hope was
very near to yield to deſpair, when
the clear-ſighted love of <hi>Berenice</hi>
wiſely adviſed her how to keep the
fool in awe and further her own
intereſt, by the moſt exquiſite and
ingenious trick, that was ever
heard of in the whole Kingdom of
<hi>Cupidon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>She on a ſudden fell out of
countenance, modeſty ſhut up for
a while her mouth, ſhe offered to
ſpeak ſome words, preſently a
ſecret baſhfulneſs forbad her ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
holding down her eyes, ſhe
ſeemed to be willing to ſpeak and
be ſilent at once: but all this was a
meer fiction, that the curious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
would offer a kind and honeſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
to her hypocritical repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and force her in a manner to
open her moſt ſecret ſentiments,</hi>
Madam, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> I ſee you extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoughtful, I conceive your
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108482:13"/>
tongue is not loyal to your heart, no
doubt, he permits her to declare
ſome things that ſhe conceals, and
which I ought to be acquainted
with; but if you will right me, I
hope of your juſtice you will deem me
no leſs diſcreet than paſſionate a Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
ſtick not to unfold me your heart,
and vex your ſelf no more by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſecret that perhaps cannot be
long a myſtery to me. Do you love
another? let me know that happy mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
let me know that fortunate Rival.
The vehement paſſion that made me
your ſlave, will give place to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
and although love doth not at
all agree with a concurrent, yet I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
my faith, that I will approve
of your choice, even with the loſs of
my own life, if my Rival proves not
altogether unworthy of you. Pardon,
amable <hi>Berenice,</hi> pardon, I cannot
forbear to intreat you againſt your
ſelf, and crave of you the opening
of a thing, whoſe declaration, perhaps,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108482:14"/>
may caſt to your vertue a bluſh, why
do you conceal me ſo long your heart,
to me I ſay, who truſt you mine own
with ſo much forwardneſs and candor?
have I a rival? let me know him,
and it is enough. Muſt I have a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val?

the point where ſhe expected him,
anſwered with a deep ſigh,</hi> Yes Sir,
you have a Rival, but a Rival that
can do you no harm; and who may

ordinary expreſſions; yet they were
as many charms to the inchanted
Lady (ſo true it is that a beloved
one pleaſeth any way) ſome tender
thanks paid his civility, and then
not a word, becauſe the Captain,
being more ſerious than gallant,
was afraid, too much ſpeech would

languiſhing voice.</hi> Sir, <hi>ſaith ſhe,</hi>
why did not Heaven inrich you with
benefits of Fortune anſwerable to your
merit? or elſe, why did not he make
me leſs proud and ambitious? alas!
I would not ſigh now, and my cure
ſhould be as quick as certain: I love
you, dear Captain, added ſhe, ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
abundance of tears; if it be a
weakneſs to own it, the preſent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of my affairs excuſeth me, and
being bereft of the protection of my
Houſe as I am, both prudence and
neceſſity ſtands to juſtifie the choice I
make of a man, that will ſerve me
for a Father, as well as for a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
Yes, I ſay again, I love you
as much for your modeſty, as I hate
for their ſickleneſs an hundred others,
who dare court me upon the meer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Fortune: but if that blind
Goddeſs hath ſo liberally and with ſo

gifts thoſe unworthy fellows; ſhe will
perhaps, ſometime do right to Vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:108482:16"/>
do not deſpair. <hi>She bluſht after ſo
free a declaration, and ſunk briskly
into the Bed, the more to perſwade</hi>
Lyſandre, <hi>that ſhe was in earneſt;
ſhe held her peace then, giving
place to the anſwer of her favorite,
who expreſſed himſelf after this
manner:</hi> Could I be ſatisfied, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that your diſcourſe is not
a pretty trick put upon me for a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
or a ſport, I would go out of a
reſpectful indifference and borrow the
moſt efficacious and exquiſite words
of eloquence, to mark you the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of my joy and gratitude: but the
certain knowledge I have of all thoſe
excellent parts, wherewith you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed,
even to admiration; as well
as my conſciouſneſs, that in this ſo
numerous Garriſon, there is no
Cavilier but ſurpaſſeth me in merit
and value, makes me be ſilent, not
refuſing to give matter to your diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement,
if ſo be, it could contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
ſomething to the recovering of a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108482:16"/>
health ſo dear and ſo precious to all
the World. Lyſandre <hi>who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
looked upon her as a proud
and ambitious Maid, being eye-witneſs
of that indifference, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſhe had received the vows of
the moſt eminent Officers in the
Town, did not flatter himſelf to
ſuch a point, as to fancy, that
before eyes ſo pierceing, and ſo
much capable to try qualifications
and endowments, he had merit
enough to deſerve ſo obliging a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
Therefore he purſued as
in a jeering manner:</hi> Madam, had
I temerity and blindneſs enough to

Speech, I could preſently lay open to
you all that is able to ingage a heart,
that ſeems already moved; as proud

his interrupted meditation. But
whiles he is walking at a good rate,
and gets out of our ſight, let us come
back into <hi>Berenices</hi> chamber, and
hear how eloquently the Major ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerates
his paſſion.</p>
            <p>This pretended favourite gave at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
upon her about night. He
met there a full and noble company,
which purpoſely he tired with a
world of diſcourſes that ſmelt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all of a civil and compleaſant
Gentleman: he affected to ſtay the
laſt, and after the Company was out,
made a motion concerning that ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
matter, that laid ſo heavy upon his
heart, that he had a Rival, but was
ſo unfortunate as to not know, who.
<hi>Berenice</hi> who was out of meaſures
with him, becauſe he himſelf did
very freely deal with her, told him as
before; <hi>He had, indeed, a Rival, but
ſuch a one, as ſhould by no means hurt
him, and that it would be always in his
power to get, not only the poſſeſſion he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108482:20"/>
ſo paſſionately aim'd at, but alſo a great
fortune withal.</hi> Our Major not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to ſtay any longer, intreated
her, one knee upon the ground, to
pull off the vail of ſo important a
Myſtery. She getting him up again
with a kind manner led him along
with her to the bottom of an <hi>Alcove,</hi>
whoſe obſcurity might do extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
well for the ſhadowing of that
privacy, wherewith ſhe had a mind
to entertain a while the poor couſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gallant. This extraordinary car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
put him in a great hope o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>
was never ſo far off in all his life.
He ſits down by her, the cloſeſt he
could, being unwilling to loſe a
word of the precious ſpeech of his
Miſtreſs, who in the mean time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to ſpeak low, that he might
conceive how repugnantly ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
her ſelf upon the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Heaven! what is not a witty and
amorous woman capable to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:108482:20"/>
She told him, <hi>She knows away how to
get themſelves both happy for ever, but
that modeſty, which is the natural por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her Sex, would forbid her to
tell it, yet ſhe could not be ſilent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
miſſing a fair opportunity to ſerve
him, and without betraying her own
ſelf-intereſt.</hi> This feign'd perplexity
which the Major believed real and
true, inflam'd him more and more,
and fed his curioſity with a new
ſtore of impatience, he prays, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats,
urges, inſtanceth, and
ſwears ſo many oaths, he would
be ſecret in caſe the intreague that
was to be truſt'd him, ſhould
come to miſcarry, that ſhe thought
no more ſeaſonable to diſſemble;
fearing beſides, that any longer delay
might perhaps quite break her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and bring the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
to nothing. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaith ſhe;
<hi>I muſt confeſs it, I am too free, but
no matter; they muſt try fortune;
that pretend to her favours. I truſt you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108482:21"/>
ſuch a ſecret, as ſhall diſcredit me
for ever, if you prove not a religious
keeper of your Oath. Since heaven, who,
no doubt, appointed us one for th' other,
got me acquainted with you, I felt
my heart ſo lively ſmitten that from
the inſenſiblity he had hitherto been in
to love, he grew tender on a ſudden:
that extraordinary tenderneſs is much
increaſed and ſtrengthned through our
mutual Society, and is come now to ſuch
a degree, as not to permit me to look
upon any other object in the world but
yee. You are inrich'd with all thoſe parts
that may inchant a heart and diſarm
the moſt ſevere Ladies; So 'tis a piece
of juſtice to me to ſubmit to that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which heaven preſcrib'd. But as
on one ſide I would be extreamly ſorry,
that afterwards you might have the
leaſt cauſe to reproach me the meanneſs
of my fortune; and as on the other
I do ardently deſire to ſee you ſet up
in a place in a manner anſwerable to
your worth, here is that which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108482:21"/>
both for the getting of the one,
and the avoiding of the other: You
muſt, dear Major, play for a while
the Rival of your ſelf, by uſing in my
behalf all the influence you may have
upon your Colonels inclinations, to get
me ſhortly married with him. You
know well enough how old he is, you
preſume of his ſtrength, and may eaſily
conceive, he won't go far off. In the
mean time I'l bend all the powers of
my wit, to rule the old man; ſo the
Colonels-lieutnancy that is now vacant,
attends you ſurely, as well, as all the
others benefits wherewith he will grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
both my youth and my birth. 'Tis
true, indeed, ſweet-Lady,</hi> interrupted
here the Major, <hi>that the Colonel is old,
that I have a great power upon him; but
who ſhall warrant me, that his careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
his nights efforts, pardon the
freedom of this word, will bring him
to the grave? Nay, your company may
revive him. It is rare to ſee people of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſty and ſtrong complexion out-live an
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108482:22"/>
age. This poſſibility being granted, what
will become of our projects? what will
become of your flouriſhing youth? what
our mutual flames will end to? and
who ſhall warrant it, that I may live
among ſo many Cauſes of mortal ſorrows,
wherein I ſhall ſee my ſelf overwhelm'd?
I would willingly undertake to ſerve
you in this occaſion, but, indeed, the
Colonel-lieutenancy, whoſe hope ought
to flatter me, hath no charms enough
to make me look with a cold indifference
on the loſs of</hi> Berenice. <hi>Yet, my dear,</hi>
reparteed ſhe briskly, <hi>you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to do me that important ſervice,
which I will not fail to acknowledge
and return in due time. It is better for
ye to injoy in hope by obliging me, than
to run the hazard of an eternal priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by refuſing to ſecond me in an
affair wherein our common intereſt is
the only end, I aim at. Do not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
all your objections, how reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ſtrong ſoever they may appear
to your eyes, will be weak and groundleſs
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108482:22"/>
to mine. Pray, forbear to trouble
me with reaſons that I cannot hear
without indignation, ſeal up to me your
love and zeal with the ſacrifice of your
own ſentiments, and be ſure, you ſhall
not oblige an ungrateful woman.</hi> This
bit ſeem'd to the Major to be of a
very hard digeſtion; yet he muſt
either ſwallow it, or fall down from
the favour of one, which he would
not have diſoblig'd for all the world.
<hi>What?</hi> mumbled he low, but loud
enough to be taken up by <hi>Berenice,
To act the Rival of my ſelf, was this
ever heard of? Or, was ever any man
brought to ſo cruel a deſtiny?</hi> Then,
lifting up his voice, he ſpake after
this manner. <hi>Being, dear Lady, you
are ſo firmly wedded to your opinion,
and will not in the leaſt remit of the
neceſſity you ſet me in, to become in a
manner my own hangman by playing
my ſelf Rival, I do the more willingly
yield to that fatal law of death, you
impoſe upon me, becauſe, in effect
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108482:23"/>
after I have loſt you; I can't but lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
and pine away, being delivered
up to troubles and deſpairs far more
cruel than the very death it ſelf. Yes,
you ſhall be obey'd, unmercifull Lady,
I will blind my ſelf to ſerve you, and
uſe my utmoſt power to ſecure and
haſten that high match your Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
aimeth to. But as you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
my Oath, ſo I hope you can't but
give me yours.</hi> To which the crafty
Lady having reparteed, ſhe would;
he made her ſwear, ſhe would be as
good as her word, aſſoon as Heaven,
who ſeem'd to have ordained them
one for the other, ſhould open the
way to their happy marriage. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renice</hi>
did not account her conſcience
to be thereby very much concerned.
Love, who is none of the moſt pious
Gods, is neither none of the moſt
faithful, and it ſeems, Antiquity did,
to no other purpoſe, ſet a band on his
eyes, but to allow him a full liberty
to miſtake. Our Major promiſed, he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108482:23"/>
ſhould the very next morning go and
try the Colonels dying inclinations,
that if in the old man could but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſpark be found, he would kindle it
into a fire, and fail not, over all, to
ſpeak of <hi>Berenice</hi> according to that
high opinion, he had conceiv'd of her
parts, and give her an exact account
of his conduct; then he kiſſed her
hand, which privacy ſhe did willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allow him to refreſh his heart, and
ſweeten his ſorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This converſation having indured
above three hours at candlelight,
one may conceive how great was
the impatience of</hi> Lyſandre <hi>who
had waited ſo long. 'Tis true, he
could be in ſome manner comforted
by the paſtime he had to hear all
through a door lying behind the
Tapeſtry, and going in a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
next the</hi> Alcove, <hi>wherein they
had betaken themſelves; however,
certain it is, what he heard, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
him ſtrangely, and perplexed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108482:24"/>
him as much as that,</hi> Berenice <hi>told
him the morning he came reſolved
to anſwer ambiguouſly about the
declaration he was ingag'd to by
her, but the laſt things he heard
through the door did ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
him, that his conſternation
was viſible at the very firſt moment
he open'd his mouth to ſpeak. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
through the ſtream of an
indifferent converſation, he took by
degrees his Spirits again, and
thought fit to diſſemble that he
knew any thing of the Secret diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in the</hi> Alcove. <hi>Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
Berenice's <hi>ſpeech concerning
her love for him did as much ſmell,
in his judgement, of a Sport, as of a
truth, he took as a paſtime to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
gallantly gallant propoſitions:
which he did after this manner.</hi>
Could I fear, <hi>Madam,</hi> you would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
my freedom, I ſhould never get
looſe ſo far out of the bonds of
reſpect and duty, as to publiſh, I love
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108482:24"/>
you; but being, that both the ſtrength
and evenneſs of your wit are known
to me, and that I have received of
you an expreſs command to ſpeak
without diſguiſe, I will not balance to
tell ye again, I love you; if it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope, God knows: but this I may
ſay, my ſelf-love doth not blind me ſo
much as to fill my heart with hope.
There would be a great folly to ſpeak
more and ſpend time upon ridiculous
and chimerical pretenſions. What?
what d'ye call chimerical pretenſions,
<hi>reply'd Berenice?</hi> Am not I worth
enough your wooing? Or is my quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſo low under yours, that I muſt ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
all hopes out of my heart? No,
dear Lady, anſwered <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> I do
not mean it ſo. It is I whoſe hope
ſhould be vain and groundleſs. It is
I who might deſerve to be turn'd into
ridicule, if I had the temerity to
aſpire to ſuch a noble alliance. This
humble apprehenſion ye have of your
ſelf, <hi>added ſhe,</hi> is a ſtrong argument
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108482:25"/>
of your merit. It makes me conceive,
that I can't but be very happy under
the Government of a man that maketh
ſo great an account of me, but pray
is there nothing elſe but modeſty that
moveth you to ſpeak ſo? Or is it not,
you love ſo much your liberty, that
you would not exchange it to that of
a maid? By no means, <hi>purſued he;</hi>
liberty, indeed, is a precious Jewel,
but it will be always both pleaſant
and glorious to <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> to make a
ſacrifice of it to a Lady infinitely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and reaſonable: this laſt part is
rarer than the former, and I may ſay,
without flattery, that amongſt all thoſe
of your Sex, I am acquainted with, I
know none but you, that poſſeſſeth emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
theſe two excellent and almoſt
divine qualities. You are extreamly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging,
<hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> if I truſt a mans word,
there will be none in the Town, but me
that deſerves the ſacrifice of your heart.
So it is, <hi>reparteed</hi> Lyſandre, there is
none but you, that may rob me of it, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108482:25"/>
there is none alſo but you, to whom I durſt
venture to proffer it. Would ye ingage
it heartily, dear <hi>Lyſandre?</hi> Yes divine
Creature, if I could believe you would
accept of it. But, <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> if you
chance to truſt it to a capricious one,
you'l have time enough to repent your
choice. If you be that capricious one,
I am ready to adore your caprices.
Well, <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> ſaith <hi>Berenice,</hi> ſince
I ſee you ſo firmly reſolved to love me,
what humour ſoever I may have, I
reſolve to love ye for ever as ye are;
and, plainly to ſatisfie your judgement
that I am in earneſt, I muſt needs open
you the merry trick I am now about, by
turning a man, who preſumes I love
him, into the very Rival of his own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ingaging him to ſerve both you
and me againſt his own will and intereſt.
<hi>Upon that ſhe acquainted him at
large with the love of the Major,
the means ſhe was uſing to rid her
ſelf of the coxcomb, and under what
colours, pretenſions and hopes ſhe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108482:26"/>
had perſwaded him to get her in
the Colonels affection.</hi> You, and I,
dear <hi>Lyſandre, ſaith ſhe,</hi> which both
nature and birth have deſtin'd to an
higher and better figure than that we
are now in, cannot more dextrouſly
and wiſely ſet up our fortune, than
by keeping and nouriſhing ſecretly for
a while our mutual flames, untill you
be further advanced in the world; and
I better provided of goods; I look upon
my match with the Colonel as a buſineſs
almoſt over, I ſhall then ſo cunningly
handle the good old mans brain, that his
Lieutenancy now vacant can't miſs to
fall upon ye. A man of ſo many ſcores
of age, whom warlike labours have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined,
ſhall not live long. The vain
hope of an heir will move him to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
me with his eſtate. He is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at eaſe; ſo we ſhall through this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, get what to live hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily,
pleaſantly and ſplendidly with all.
The Major hath much credit upon the
Decrepit's mind, as he flatters himſelf
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108482:26"/>
with the hope of injoying me, ſo he is
diſpos'd to neglect nothing that may
carry on the buſineſs, he ſhall to morrow
night give me an account of the effect
of his firſt eſſays, which ye will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
acquainted with. <hi>Now,</hi> dear
<hi>Lyſandre,</hi> after ſuch an intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
could ye keep any longer within
your heart any miſtruſt injurious to my
ſincerity, and doubt ſtill that I love you?

would deem my ſelf to be the moſt unjuſt

All that ye have contrived pleaſeth me,

and there is nothing in my power, but I

ſtrong paſſion of love, as with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

wiſely that little pains ſpeak, but
great ſorrows are dumb. My love kept
his peace in your preſence, becauſe being

reſented with; and if now he breaks

in that I may ſay, you did me juſtice,

of his ſelf-rival ſtands in a ſecret
and intimate conference with the
Colonel, there unfolding and ſetting
all the ſails of his eloquence to move
him, and cunningly handling the
moſt pathetical reaſons to kindle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
his almoſt dead fires, and get
him up in love, he repreſents unto
him that, to paſs away his time in
ſo ſad and fretful ſolitarineſs, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to languiſh than to live; that
all the world admires why, having
ſo great an eſtate, he looks not for
the laſt and ſweeteſt comforts of this
life in the ſociety of ſome amable
perſon; that what ſervice ſoever he
may receive of a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of attendants, yet ſuch a ſervice,
being intereſt'd, ought not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with the tender cares he might
expect from a wife that would ſerve
him out of inclination; that the
example of</hi> David <hi>is a precedent for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108482:28"/>
him, and ſeoures his reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
biting tongues, in caſe he will
joyn with ſome young woman; and
in fine, that none but indiſcreet and
fooliſh folks ſhould be thereby ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized,
and laugh ſillily at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
flames. Love, who ſeeks
for nothing ſo forwardly as for the
perpetuating of himſelf and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of his Empire, takes part
with the Major, drops in the old
mans heart, and cauſeth him to
anſwer with a ſmile:</hi> That he was
apt enough to follow his counſel, if
he could meet with an object worthy
ones while, that long ago he had a
great propenſity that way, if his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
diſeaſes had permitted him to take
a turn in <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Flanders;</hi> becauſe
to his apprehenſion, <hi>Maeſtrich</hi> was ſo
little furniſhed with exquiſite beauties,
that he knew there not one which might
awake his paſſion: That, indeed, the
ſeveral Nations, eſpecially the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>French,</hi> had brought up ſome
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108482:29"/>
Gallantry in the town, that there could
be found ſome well bred and witty
creatures, but they were, for the moſt
part, wither'd and liable to ſuſpicion.
Ah, Sir, <hi>reſumes the Major,</hi> muſt
it be, that ſome braces of fooliſh and gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Women ſet ſhame on the forehead
of a great many innocent? I confeſs,
There is ſcarce in all <hi>Europe</hi> a town
that affords ſo little ſtore of Beauties
as <hi>Meaſtrich,</hi> but yet it is not ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
unprovided with, but there may
be ſome one that will contend with
the very <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Beauties
themſelves. They are then Cloſet-pieces,
<hi>purſued the old fellow;</hi> They
dare not appear in publick, for fear of
becoming too common; they are afraid
of the Sun-burning; or it may be, they
ſcruple to ſhame the reſt of thoſe of their
Sex. Prethee Major give me an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſhew me ſome fair of that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter;
thou haſt deſcribed I know, there
is no place ſo cloſe, no houſe or family
ſo ſevere, but thou may'ſt get in a free
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108482:29"/>
acceſs by thy fair humour and ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manners. There, no doubt, thou
ſaw'ſt ſome extraordinary merit; Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
me ſo much, as to tell me what
thou didſt diſcover there, that may
deſerve the ingagement of a noble Soul.
No need, Sir, <hi>reply'd the Major,</hi> to
go ſo far, will ye know a maid that
deſerveth your love? Caſt but your
eyes upon Miſtreſs, <hi>Berenice,</hi> that
worthy heireſs of the great Vertues
of your late friend the Colonel. This
young Maid is eminently indow'd with
the moſt excellent graces of Body and
Soul, ſhe is the wonder of her age, her
Vertue, which ſtands any trial, get's
her reſpect from the moſt licentious,
and no man in the world can boaſt of
the leaſt favour of hers. That Maid,
<hi>reparteed the Colonel,</hi> hath, indeed, all
the parts, you ſaid I knew her, when
very young, and am better ſatisfy'd
than any other of her excellent and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
breeding. But I can hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſhew would ſacrifice ſo flouriſhing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108482:30"/>
a youth to ſo many loathſome infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of a man of my age, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thoſe ſmall advantages, ſhe may
expect by her alliance with an old and
almoſt overus'd Souldier, before all
the pleaſures that attend her by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
ſome luſty and brisk young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.
Could I hope, dear, Major,
that charming Maid would give ear
to any terms, through your mediation,
I would be ready to do any thing in her
behalf, and to acknowledge the good
office, I ſhould have received of you in
that occaſion. But how to blot out of
her mind the ſweet Ideas of ſo many
compleat young Cavaliers who court her
aſſiduouſly, and how to trace in, in their
room the image of an old man no leſs
troubleſome than unable to breed Love?
Sir, Sir, <hi>reply'd the Major,</hi> I paſs my
word confidently, that Miſtreſs <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
is none of thoſe fickle and volatile
Maids, which a ſute of cloath well ſet,
a colour'd Ribban, a mingled Plumet,
or a flouriſh, gently uttered out, may
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108482:30"/>
intice, ſhe hath a refined taſt, and I
am enough acquainted with her, to
aſſure you, ſhe will wiſely prefer the
ſolid benefits of your alliance before the
falſe brightneſs of all thoſe <hi>Adonis,</hi> by
whom ſhe is every day beſieged. Give
me but your word, that you love her,
and let me alone for the reſt. I ſwear
it Sir, <hi>ſaid the Old man,</hi> but, to come
about my deſign, what am I able to do?
my Gout gives me no truce, I cannot
pay her a viſit. So I am out of all means
to aſſure her of my love. No matter,
<hi>anſwer'd the Major,</hi> I will govern
her mind ſo dextrouſly, that ſhe ſhall
wait upon you to the very corner of
your chimney; or elſe, if you think it
more convenient to invite her your
ſelf, write but a letter capable to make
ſome impreſſion, and next it will be my

               </gap>art and buſineſs to help it with the

Forget not to feign, you thought upon
her a great while ago, and that you
have things of moment to acquaint

her withall. <hi>The old man likes the

                  <p>The Major charg'd with this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
went out preſently to <hi>Berenice</hi>'s
lodgings; he had no ſooner paid her
the uſual duties, but, lifting up his
voice as in a tranſport of joy, he
told her: <hi>Dear Lady, you have carried
it, you have got all, and it will be long
of none but you, that you do not injoy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
read this note, it confirms what I ſay.
Berenice</hi> ſhew'd a great deal of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to the Major and ſaid, <hi>that by
obliging her, he had ſerved himſelf,</hi>
and with ſparkling eyes, witneſſes
of her joy, ſhe kiſſ'd and read the
Letter over and over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She thought
not fit to anſwer the note by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
had not her own intereſt
moved her to wait upon the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
the deference and reſpect due
to a man of that quality, and who
had been ſo great a friend with her
own Father, could not but perſwade
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108482:32"/>
her to pay him that civility; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe deſired the Major to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
his Colonel from her with
an intire ſubmiſſion to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and that, at his beſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity

                     <hi>Thus the unfortunate Major
thought beſt to venture all, to win
all, he goeth ſtraightway to the
Colonel, acquaints him with the
ſucceſs of his negotiation, and he
had no ſooner turn'd his back, but</hi>
Lyſandre <hi>took his place, and in a
familiar diſcourſe with his Miſtreſs
knew all the tranſactions between
her and the old Man. They were
in the heat of ſo delightful a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
when the Major arrived in
the Colonels Coach and knocked
at the door, ſhe had no more time
than needed, to get behind the
hangings her dear</hi> Lyſandre, <hi>who not
being able to forbear coughing,
gave birth to the ſuſpicions and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy
of the Major; yet he was
pleaſed for that time to diſſemble
and give the lye to his ears; he took
his pretended Miſtreſs by the hand,
led her to the Coach, and from her
houſe to the Colonels. Baſhfulneſs
which is ſo natural to the fair Sex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:108482:33"/>
painted upon</hi> Berenice <hi>cheeks at the
moment of her introduction into
the Chamber, that precious ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million,
which contributes ſo much
to the imbelliſhment of beauty:
the old man made all imaginable
efforts to ſtand up right and go to
meet her; after ſitting down at fire,
it was firſt handſomely complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on both ſides; the diſcourſe fell
next upon the late Colonels death,
whereupon</hi> Berenice <hi>paid an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
duty of tears and ſighs. The
Major fearing it would be a hard
matter to paſs from an extream ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to that mirth, which ought to
prepare them to the opening and
receiving joyful propoſitions, broke
ſeaſonably their diſcourſe by riſing
up with precipitation, and feigning
to have now an appointment at the
Governours Palace. It was of his
prudence to ſet ſo the old man in
meaſures and give him opportunity
to ſpeak alone; he took then his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108482:33"/>
leave for an hour or two, which
he ſpent in the next gallery amongſt
the moſt extravagant fancies that
jealouſy can afford in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:
after his being retir'd, our
old man drew with much ado his
elbow-chair near that of</hi> Berenice,
<hi>changed his Screen to hers and
ſpoke after this manner:</hi> Madam,
the Language of a man of my age is
a great deal different from that of a
perſon which but begins to live: A
young Wooer that would make you his
declaration of love, ſhould uſe choſen
terms, and ſhould not venture to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
you with the diſcourſe of his
paſſion, before having, through a long
acquaintance, got ſome favourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
for his deſign; but a man who
contends with death, ought to ſpeak
more freely, becauſe he ſpeaks with
more ſincerity. My life hath had, as
well as that of others, its ages and
its language; It is come now to that
point, wherein a man may ſpeak with
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108482:34"/>
ſecurity. My lord your Father was
the beſt of my Friends, and to my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I can't bear any better witneſs
to that eternal friendſhip, we ſwore
one another, than by making you heireſs
of the remembrance, wherewith I do
honour his memory. All that I poſſeſs in
this world is altogether inſignificant to
revive his aſhes, but, ſweet Lady, if you
would accept of my alliance, then I
might boaſt of having tried all poſſible
ways to revive him. This open decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
perhaps ſurpriſeth you, but I may
circumſtance it with ſo many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
conditions, that, far from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
you any juſt offence, it is moſt
capable to convince a Maid, as witty and
judicious as ye are. You know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
Dear Child, that you can but
hardly, by the inconſiderable eſtate my
Lord left ye, get a fortune that may
anſwer your birth and the greatneſs of
your heart. Men now adays do little
value birth and wit without riches, and
we ſhould call back again the time of our
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108482:34"/>
old Romances Hero's, to ground upon
beauty alone. Heaven that heaped in
your perſon both the graces of the body,
the parts of the wit, and the glory of
a noble extraction, refuſed you the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of fortune, whoſe privation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
indeed they are by themſelves
contemptible and deſpicable, is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
accounted, in this blind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
age, the greateſt of all imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The reſpect I bear to the memory
of our illuſtrious Dead, and the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I have conceived for your amable
Perſon in particular, cauſed me a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times to reflect upon your fate
with tears in my eyes. I have lifted
up my ſelf above my age; forgot its
coldneſs, and thought having no heirs
and being ſo near my grave, I could
ſeal up and conſummate all your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
parts by adding to them the laſt
prerogative, you want for. If you yield
to my deſires, all that I poſſeſs is yours;
ye ſee, I am old, ſickly, ſubject to ſuch
infirmities, as would never permit me
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108482:35"/>
to live long. Now, Dear Miſtreſs, if
your heart pleads for my happineſs,
pray make haſt to declare it, as many
minutes you delay to give you to me
will be as many halfs of an happy life,
you rob me of. I confeſs, a conjugal uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with ſome young Gentleman of your
age ſhould be long weighed in the ſcale
of wiſdom, and would require a great
many reflections before coming to a final
agreement; but that which I proffer
you, being but for a while, requires not
ſo much conſideration. Well, Madam,
urged now the old man, how d'ye like
my motion? What d'ye think on it,
ſweet Lady? That it is both honourable
and advantageous to me, ſaid <hi>Berenice</hi>
with a modeſt ſmile: without ſo much
ado, Sir, I give my conſent, I ow too
much to your bounty, to refuſe you any
thing, but do me the favour to believe,
I act in this affair leſs by intereſt
than gratitude. Yes, Sir, I right
both you and me, when I ſacrifice
my liberty and my cares to a perſon
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108482:35"/>
I am ſo far ingaged to, through ſo
many and ſo antient obligations, you
ſhall be obeyed as ſoon as you pleaſe; a
note from your hand will call me at any
time to my duty; but I would be glad,
our buſineſs ſhould make no noiſe abroad,
and that I were ſooner honoured with
the quality of your wife, than the
Town, or your very ſervants might
know it. <hi>This ſweet conſent being
ſo delivered up, the old man put
forth his hand, took that of</hi> Berenice;
<hi>and then they ſwore one another
an inviolable and everlaſting fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
whereupon the Major coming
into the Chamber, ended their
charming converſation. The Colonel
bids him to ſit down, fends the
footman back, and addreſſing to
the Major, tells him merrily:</hi> Could
ye believe it, Sir, that a man as heavy
as I am, might run ſo far in ſo little
while? Could ye be perſwaded, I have
ſtormed in an hour the fineſt and
ſtrongeſt place in this country, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108482:36"/>
that this amable Child, <hi>pointing to</hi>
Berenice, is now mine? Yes, why not,
<hi>replyed the Major,</hi> a man that grew
old in the wars as ye did, doth not he
know all engines, tricks and ſtratagems
whereby places are taken in? and as for
that you call Madam <hi>Berenice</hi> yours,
could there be found in all the world
a perſon that deſerves better your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption?
Say rather, my ſelf, <hi>reſumed
the Colonel,</hi> ſince I gave my ſelf
wholly to her, and am no more mine.
How Sir, <hi>purſued the Major!</hi> is it
poſſible? What betrothed ſo ſoon, that is
to go very faſt indeed, that is to diſpatch
matters pretty well. Two Souls born
one for the other, <hi>interrupted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly</hi>
Berenice, knit together at the
firſt approach, and their union is ſo
natural, nay ſo neceſſary, that it muſt
be made in ſpight of all contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
and it paſſeth by all ſorts of
conſiderations ſoever. I bleſs God,
Madam, <hi>ſaid the Major,</hi> that he hath
been pleaſed to give his hand to the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108482:36"/>
execution of a match, which he had
decreed from all eternity, and I will
prove none of the leſs zealous to
honour with feaſts and pieces of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
your illuſtrious Alliance. <hi>The
Colonel thanked his Major for his
kindneſs and civility, truſted into
his hand the handſome Bride, to
carry her back; fearing, if he
ſhould keep her the whole day
according to the motion of his
heart, ſome body might have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſuſpect ſomething through
ſo long an abſence. The company
roſe up: Madam</hi> Berenice <hi>profered
a kiſs to her old ſenſible, who ſtaid
half a quarter of an hour glued up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her cheeks, even to the very
ſhedding of tears out of joy. I
leave you to think whether our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Self-Rival bore this action
very patiently in his heart; he, I
ſay, who reckoned all the kiſſes,
the old man did give to</hi> Berenice,
<hi>and looked upon them, as, as many
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108482:37"/>
thefts of his own goods; but being
of his moderation and policy to
diſſemble, he plaid fairly the part
of a Paranymph, ſtopping up the
ſentiments of a deſperate lover, he
led my Lady to the Coach, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
her to her lodging, where he
had not time to injoy the pleaſure
of a long converſation, becauſe the
Colonel, either already grown jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
or impatient to get all things
in order againſt the next day, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to return as ſoon as he
could; taking his leave of the Lady,
he offered to kiſs her hand as he
was uſed to do, but ſhe refuſed him
that favour with a gentle pride;
whereupon he could not forbear
to tell her:</hi> What? Madam, I did
preſume, my ſervices ought to make
me bolder, and you more private; but
it proves now quite contrary, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
that to day by contempt, which you
granted me yeſterday by inclination;
have you a mind to juſtify the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108482:37"/>
that ſaith, <hi>humours change man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi>
or am I guilty of any fault
that may deſerve the privation of
your eſteem? By no means, Sir, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered</hi>
Berenice, if I deny you to day,
what I granted yeſterday, 'tis out of
juſtice, not of any reſentment. I could
not, without crime (ſince ingratitude
is one) forget the great benefits I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of your zeal, but could I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without injuſtice, diſpoſe of a
good that is no more mine; you know
to whom I belong; When heaven
hath put anend to the work; whoſe happy
conſummation I am ſo greedy of,
then I will prove as much faithful
to you, as I am now to him, which
the ſame heaven hath ſet over me for
ſome while. <hi>So judicious and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
an anſwer ought to ſatisfy
and calm again the moſt peeviſh
of men; yet the Major could not
like it, becauſe he had fooliſhly
fancy'd, this alliance ſhould ſerve
but as a ſhadow to his pleaſures,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108482:38"/>
he made to himſelf a great violence
to ſtop his humour, and coldly took
his leave of</hi> Berenice; <hi>but as ſoon as
he had ſtept into the Coach, he gave
himſelf over as a prey to the moſt
terrible trouble of mind that can
be imagined, he bids the Coachman
to drive twice round about the town.
The coach was very well ſtuff'd with
cotton, nevertheleſs he finds himſelf
uneaſie within. One while he leans
on his elbow at the right, another,
at the left hand; puts now his hat
on his knee, then on his his head;
looks earneſtly on the boot, yet,
being there ſaluted by many, he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
none again. 'Tis impoſſible to
tell how ſeveral and extravagant
poſtures he puts himſelf upon, till at
laſt he arrives at his Rivals houſe,
where he calls back all that he can of
his former tranquillity, but, alas, in
vain: as far as the old man could ſee
him, he cryed out merrily,</hi> Well,
Sir, what is my pretty Lady now a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108482:38"/>
doing? What buſineſs was ſhe about,
when you left her? <hi>He heard not a
word of that; being come nearer, the
Colonel reiterates the ſame queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which he heareth with the ſame
attention. So ſtrange a wandering
of thoughts ſurpriſed the old man,
who for the third time, went on in
his former motion; but at that, our
Lover quite out of countenance an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
Yes, Sir, yes; which as you
may judge, was a very extravagant
repartee: at firſt the Colonel was apt
to believe his Major had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in ſome exceſſive drinking,
but reflecting upon the little while,
there was ſince he had left him, and
ſeeing beſides, he looked not at all
as a fuddled man, he conceived ſo ill
an opinion of this miniſter of his
love, that he could never ſince
find in his heart to look upon him
with a good eye; he played never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
fair to him, invited him to
ſupper, and through the ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108482:39"/>
they had together, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
clearly, he was not at all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
of</hi> Berenice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lyſandre</hi> who was always buſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſome cloath, which he did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
buy, in a Drapers ſhop next to
his dear Ladies lodging, obſerved
from thence all the Majors ſteps,
and what time he was either going in
or coming out of the houſe, he ſpyed
that day above three hours, and
after he had at laſt ſeen him ſtep
in to the Coach, he immediately
flew to <hi>Berenice,</hi> which allowed him
to ſavour an hundred kiſſes upon
her ſweet lips with as much priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as with pride ſhe refuſed to the
Major a ſimple kiſs of her hand. She
ſummed up to him all that came to
paſs in the interview with the old
man; next they both renewed their
mutual proteſtations of an eternal
love, and then the wiſe Lady for
ſome juſt reaſons diſmiſſed him with
an unvaluable kiſs, ſtrickly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108482:39"/>
him to wait any more upon
her in that houſe, leſt his viſits
might perhaps prejudice his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
and adviſing him further
to court more aſſiduouſly the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel,
about whom ſhe would not
fail to ſerve him to her utmoſt
power. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Miſtreſſes preſence, but there came
in the Colonels Chamber-Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who had order to look what

and to deſire her from his Maſter,
to get herſelf ready againſt the

an extraordinary breakfaſt.</p>
                  <p>In effect about that time, after
the Majors arrival into the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels

into the Coach, and he receiv'd
command to fetch in forthwith Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
<hi>Berenice.</hi> She waited for him
impatiently, being riſen up betimes
that day, and having us'd all her

which deſign ſucceeded her ſo well,
and ſo happily joined Art with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſet off her Beauty, that as
ſoon as the Major caſt his Eyes
upon her, trouble and confuſion
laid hold on his diſtreſſed Soul
<q>Alas! ſaid he, is this the divine
treaſure I am a going to ſacrifice
to the paſſion of a Rival? If Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ought to refuſe it to my vows,
ſhould he uſe my own hand to
deliver it up into anothers? O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Major! O too happy
Colonel! Why doth not fortune
regard rather ſtrength and merit,
than greatneſs and riches? O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
what ſtrange inequality of
ages! But 'tis to inveigh, to no
purpoſe; 'tis to ſpend idly ones
while, purſued he; 'tis to provoke
you, Madam, to declaim any longer
againſt the malice of fate: This
unjuſt Divinity hath condemn'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108482:40"/>
me to play the ridiculous Rival of
my ſelf; you have ſubſcrib'd my
ſentence, and now you force
me to put it into execution.</q>
                     <q>Your
tranſports, interrupted <hi>Berenice,</hi>
being interpreted by me, are not
abſolutely to be deem'd unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
but they are neither to be
altogether allow'd. I confeſs, 'tis
a hard caſe for a man that loves
ſincerity to ſee another preferr'd
before himſelf; but when ſuch a
preference, which in theſe preſent
circumſtances we muſt call a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
for a while, is to be turn
to our own advantage for ever,
then it ought to temper our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
and calm all our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
or elſe we are rather our
own foes than the right lovers of
our good: 'Tis true indeed you
act now in a manner the Rival
of your ſelf, but certain it is, you
do it for your own ſake, and upon
account of great hopes. Forbear
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108482:41"/>
then, dear Sir, to curſe a deſtiny
that doth you more ſervice than
wrong; the time to come will
make good what I ſay.</q> 
                     <q>But Sir, added ſhe, is it not to try a little
too long the patience of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that waits for us? Will ye
be pleas'd to comply with their
deſires?</q> 
                     <q>I will, Madam, repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teed
the Major: If I have detain'd
you ſo long, 'tis, Madam, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
your preſence blots out of
mens memory all the reſt of the
World. Let us go then, dear and
precious Victim, let us go, I will
be the witneſs and Prieſt of your

whom in my turn, I may devote the
Sacrifice of my ſelf. Come, Madam,
let us go when you pleaſe; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

I have made for you.</q> After theſe
laſt words, he took <hi>Berenice</hi>'s hand,
and ſhe ſhak'd him by his own, as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108482:41"/>
a token that his vows would be
fulfill'd in due time.</p>
                  <p>The Colonel, to whom Joy lent
a new ſtore of ſtrength, met his
Bride at the ſtairs, from whence
he led her gallantly into the room,
wherein a Notary and the Parſon
of the Pariſh Church waited for
them. There was but little talking;
the contract was plain, containing
a general, free and exceptionleſs
donation, after death, of all the ſaid
Lord Colonels goods, both mova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and unmovable, effects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
or appendants whatſoever,
to his future Wife. Which being
done and ſign'd, they engag'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally
their Faith before the
company, which ſubſcrib'd as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
to the action.</p>
                  <p>No Wedding was ever made
with ſo little noiſe as this; only
the Major dined, and ſpent the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the day with the Colonel
and his new Lady; and the very

ſervants of the houſe were not a
little amaz'd, when at night offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to undreſs their Lord, there
came a Gentlewoman, who paid
the ſame duty to a Lady which got
firſt into the Bed. They believed
all, it was a dream; but the next
morning the tydings of this alliance
became publick in Town, and
<hi>Lyſandre,</hi> whom <hi>Berenice</hi> had given
notice unto, came in, and before
all the family wiſh'd to the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
much Joy, and an heir both of
his Vertues and his illuſtrious
Blood. After this publication, there
was nothing but Feaſts, Tourning,
Races, ſplendid Entertainments,
Balls, Plays, and other pieces of
Gallantry, wherein the Officers of
the Regiment, and amongſt them
the Major and Captain <hi>Lyſandre</hi>
were the moſt forward and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable

                     </gap>
and now ſhe begun to diſcover to

                     </gap>
the favour of kiſſing her hand, and
how ſeverely ſhe rebuked his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
then making uſe of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
ſhe made him ſo hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a picture of the man, that the
Colonel grew ſuddenly hot; and as
the laſt age, becauſe of his weakneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is apt to be jealous, he blamed with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108482:43"/>
ſharp terms the Majors liberty
which he took as an inſign affront
put upon himſelf, and ſwore he
would never make the leaſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
to get him into the place of
Lieutenant Colonel; but rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
to it the laſt Captain of the
Regiment. Upon that Oath, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renice</hi>
(ſhe will, if you pleaſe, go
ſtill by that name) added, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he would have reaſon to do
ſo, and that if the people talked of
the good grace, expences and ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
of the Major, all the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
did commend nothing ſo much
as the prudence, wiſdom and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of a certain Captain, which
ſhe believed was named <hi>Lyſandre.</hi>
                     <q>That <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> you ſpeak of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteed
the old man, is an Officer
of an extraordinary worth, and
they ſay of him that he is the only
Captain, who had no deſerters in
his Company during two years,
which is not a weak argument of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108482:44"/>
his prudent conduct: I would have
already made ſomething for him,
had not I feared to offend the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,
and turn into a dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
a man that had alwayes a great
part in my confidence.</q> The wiſe <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renice</hi>
inſiſted no further, leſt ſhe
might appear to be partizan of <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre.</hi>
She thought the work was begun
well enough, and, no doubt, it
would ſucceed to the beſt advantage
of her lover; ſo ſhe cunningly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the diſcourſe to ſome other
matter concerning the Oeconomy of
the Houſe.</p>
                  <p>Things ſtanding upon theſe
tearms, came on a weighty buſineſs
that was to be treated with his
highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Regiment. There
was a great honour to be got in ſo
important a truſt; therefore <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
was not idle. She concerned
her ſelf too much in the glory of
her dear <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> to not procure
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108482:44"/>
him a fair opportunity to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
known to the Prince. She
ſuſpected, the Major would privately
ſue for the commiſſion; and, indeed,
the old man deſigned already to
ſend him thither, but ſhe broke dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly
their meaſures, by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Major to not accept a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
that would abſent him from
her for a long while, ſwearing that,
being bereft of his ſweet conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
ſhe could not enjoy one hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
day in the company of ſo old
and exceeding troubleſome a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
This intreaty was like a law
to the Major, whom ſuch a tender
teſtimony of love cured almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
of all thoſe ſtrong ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he had conceived of a ſecret
intreague between <hi>Berenice</hi> and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandre;</hi>
ſo at the firſt motion the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
made him for his journey at
Court, he excuſed himſelf on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a <hi>Sciatica,</hi> being thereby
altogether unable to go either on
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108482:45"/>
horſeback, or in a Coach. <hi>Berenice</hi>
was preſent when his excuſes were
allowed, and after they had long
debated, what Officer the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the negotiation ſhould be
truſted unto, <hi>Berenice</hi> took up the
Speech, and ſaid to her husband,
that two or three days ago he ſpoke
to her of a certain Captain named
<hi>Lyſandre,</hi> as a Gentleman of ſome
extraordinary merit, and told her,
amongſt ſeveral other Vertues,
that. Officer was indowed with,
he was highly ſatisfied of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and moderation; that this
Character was fit for the buſineſs
in hand, and ſo he would do very
well to pitch upon none other
but him. The Major who was
looking for an opportunity to oblige
<hi>Berenice,</hi> and beſides was very much
content to remove <hi>Lyſandre</hi> from
her, fell into the ſnare, and, for from
Croſſing her nomination, he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
much of it, commending and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108482:45"/>
ſetting off both the capacity and
zeal of the choſen Captain; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the Commiſſion was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>Lyſandre</hi> with order to depart
forthwith.</p>
                  <p>He was no ſooner ſet out for his
Journey, but a certain fellow that
my Lady had turned away for a
roguery, in hope of ſome recompence
from the Major, came and told him,
that Captain <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
leave of the Colonel, had been
in a cloſe and intimate conference
with my Lady, and that he had
heard all their diſcourſes. Our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Major promiſed him a great
reward, if he would tell exactly
and orderly all that he heard. Well,
Sir, ſhe began after this manner, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
the rogue: <q>Dear <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> O
how much ingaged thou art to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
all things do concur to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
thy deſtiny. Now, my dear,
now is the time to work. Now
'tis your buſineſs to act vigorouſly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108482:46"/>
in the commiſſion, be ſure, my
dear, your hope to the Colonel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieutenancy,
won't be ſet upon a
ſolid foundation, before you get in
his highneſs eſteem; take heed
then to ſhew your ability and zeal
to that Prince, who knows as well as
any other in <hi>Europe</hi> how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
merit, and reward vertue.
The Major, at firſt, had prevailed
ſo far upon my husband, that he
was reſolved to truſt him with this
honourable negotiation, whoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
ſucceſs had, no doubt, advanced
him to the place, which I hope
you'l obtain through my unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
intereſt: but I found out, how
to take advantage of his weakneſs.
I feign'd, I could not want ſo long
the comfort of his viſits (poor ſilly
fool, he ſeeth not, I deal ſo, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
him for ever to make me any.)
Go then, ſweet Soul, go on; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
this is the firſt ſtep thou
makeſt into the temple of fortune:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108482:46"/>
remember, <hi>Lyſandre</hi> and <hi>Berenices</hi>
happineſs lyeth in thy hands. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu,
my dear, fail not to have me
acquainted with the place of thy
abode, direct thy letters to my wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
women, ſhe is faithful and
wiſe.</q> This is all that I could hear,
ſaid the perfidious footman; Enough
in conſcience for the Majors peace,
and indeed, there was no need, this
indiſcreet wretch would add, that
<hi>Lyſandre</hi> anſwered ſhortly: <q>How
many thouſand ways am I your
ſlave, incomparable Lady, fear not,
fear not, where <hi>Berenice</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<hi>Lyſandre</hi> is able to perform
all things; and then they imbraced
one another the moſt cloſely they
could, nay to ſuch a tranſport of
delight, as to lift themſelves up
twice by turn out of the ground.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Major ſhewed not himſelf
ſenſible of this narrative before the
fellow, he gave him money, and
kept him in his houſe ſome while to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108482:47"/>
that purpoſe, we ſhall ſpeak of. If
love is ſometimes ſuſpicious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ground, that of the Major grew
ſo with reaſon. Revolving within
himſelf, from whence could proceed
a reciprocal inclination whoſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
appeared in ſo dangerous a
commerce, he was confounded
through the variety of his thoughts,
but after a long vexation of mind he
reſolved to intercept <hi>Lyſandre</hi>'s let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to <hi>Berenice,</hi> his anger did not
in the leaſt break out the four or five
days, during which no tidings
could come from <hi>Lyſandre;</hi> for, on
one ſide he would put off the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his indignation to her untill
he might be altogether convinced of
a perfidy that could ſcarce find any
belief within his Soul, what ſtrong
prejudices ſoever the footman had
given him; and on the other he
found always <hi>Berenice</hi> ſo even in her
diſcourſes and carriage towards him,
that he had rather to bely his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108482:47"/>
for a while, than accuſe
her of infidelity upon a ſuſpicion
which he would have cleared in a
ſhort time: he ſends then the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to the factor of the Poſt-office,
who knowing him well, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
he was ſtill a ſervant to the
Colonel, did not ſcruple to give
him a letter which Captain <hi>Lyſandre</hi>
wrote to his ſweet Lady. The
Major was juſt coming out of the
Colonels lodging, where he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a great deal of new proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of an everlaſting fidelity from
<hi>Berenice,</hi> when the footman met
him and delivered him the fatal let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The direction to the waiting-woman,
being agreeable to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Rogue, caſt him in a
dreadful perplexity, he ſcrupled
whether he ought, either to burn the
letter for his quiets ſake, carry it
ſealed up to <hi>Berenice,</hi> or open it;
at laſt after having ſpent the whole
night in a great anxiety, he took the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108482:48"/>
party to read it. It was of this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>

                  <p>The reading of this Letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
the trouble of the Major, it
ſeemed to him enigmatical and the
ſenſe obſcure, therefore he reſolved
to have it directed to the Colonels
Centinel, who gave it to a ſervant,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108482:48"/>
from whoſe hands it came into thoſe
of the waitingmaid, and next into my
Lady's. <hi>Berenice</hi> read it with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of joy. It was ſhort indeed,
but the moſt compendious Love-Letters
ſpeak always enough. She
anſwered it, but that anſwer eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
the curioſity of the Major, who
would have willingly given an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Piſtols for't. In the mean time
<hi>Berenice</hi> perceived clearly, her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had been unſealed, and the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
way it came by, confirmed her
opinion. Now that it was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by any trick of the Major,
ſhe could not imagine it; So ſhe
kept ſtill with him the ſame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
untill ſome ambiguous
words reflecting upon the matter
having ſlipped out of his mouth
through indiſcretion, ſhe doubted
no more but he had ſurpriſed her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
Letter; but it being conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to diſſemble, ſhe feigned to not
underſtand the diſcourſe where he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108482:49"/>
betrayed and contradicted himſelf
ſo imprudently; nevertheleſs ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
within her heart new ſeeds
of hatred for him; Nay ſhe cooled
on a ſudden in that very converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and appeared ſo dull and ſo
wandering in her thoughts, that the
Major at ſo ſubit an alteration took
Omen from thence, there was ſome
thing a contriving againſt him, he
roſe up and left coldly <hi>Berenice,</hi>
who paid his coldneſs with her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                  <p>A baſh of that nature offered to a
Lady as ſenſible and refined as <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renice,</hi>
by a man who ſeemed to be
in the wrong, appeared in her
Judgement unpardonable; but, pray,
what had he to loſe, that had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to hope? The Major on his
ſide accounted himſelf highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
by <hi>Berenice,</hi> and thought it was
no more ſeaſon to diſſemble with
her, he waits upon her in the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
manner, asketh how ſtands the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108482:49"/>
buſineſs committed to <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> and
when he muſt be prefer'd to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Lieutenancy. <hi>Berenice</hi> being
ſcandalized at ſo rude a queſtion,
made anſwer, that ſhe medled not but
with her houſhold, being conſcious
enough, all other matters were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the capacity of her wit: that
my Lord could better ſatisfy him
about his motion. The Majors im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
did certainly deſerve the
ſeverity of this repartee; however
he was extreamly amazed, and
thought himſelf ſo much wrong'd
by it, that he forgot himſelf to ſuch
a degree of indiſcretion, as to ſay
that a Footman who had newly left
the livery came of his own accord
and diſcovered to him ſo ſtrange
things, that one could ſcarce give
any credit to them; and, although
he ſuſpended his judgement, yet he
could not but be thereby in a great
trouble; that if ſhe doubts of the
truth of his words, he takes upon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108482:50"/>
himſelf, to cauſe the ſame Footman to
tell again, in her preſence, all that he
had reported to him concerning her
love with <hi>Lyſandre.</hi> You have loſt
all your credit, and that part you
have got in my eſteem, ſaid ſharply
<hi>Berenice,</hi> lifting up her voice, If you
do not immediately produce before
me that man, and if he maintaineth
not his report to my face, win him
at any rate, and bring him hither
preſently; go on, Sir I ſtay for you.
The Major went home, call'd for
the Footman and told him that in
reſpect of his ſervice, he had ſpoken
a good word in his behalf to my
Lady, and ſet him again into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
that he muſt come along to
get both his pardon and his Livery
in his preſence. This bait dazzleth
the wretch, who ſeeth not how
near he ſtands to the cudgel, which
indeed he had over deſerved; he
follows his gentle mediator to the
Colonels houſe: my Lady hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108482:50"/>
of their coming, ſhe bids all the
ſervants to retire, and gets into the
ſtable together with the Major and
the honourable Raſcal, ſhutting up
the door for better ſecurity. Now
the Major addreſſing to the Rogue
ſaith to him; Friend, my Lady is more
mercifull than thou art guilty, ſhe
forgives thee all thy faults on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that thou ſhalt confeſs to have
reported to me what paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her and Captain <hi>Lyſandre,</hi>
before his departure for the <hi>Hague:</hi>
Firſt, didſt not thou come to me of
thy own accord, before I had ever
ſpoken to thee, that I know of? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
didſt not thou—he was ready
to go on, when the Boy who was
not ſo dull as not to foreſee the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
he was in, if he would not ſpeak
in favour of my Lady, anſwered
him briskly: hark ye Maſter Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,
there is no firſt nor ſecond with
me. Firſt I came not to you, you
met me. Secondly, I told you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108482:51"/>
elſe but what the money, you
gave me, made me tell ye; there is
all, urge me no more; for, by God,
I will declare how you imployed
me to ſurpriſe the Letter, but I ſay
no more; are ye content, Maſter
Major? Maſter Major was quite
out of countenance and ready to
thunder againſt this wicked impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor;
but my Lady, whoſe intereſt
was to ſtifle the noiſe, told him,
Maſter Major: we have got matters
clear enough, ſend back this miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
he forgot your inſtructions;
another time he will better play his
part. At theſe ſharp biting words the
Major took pet and came to that
exceſs of paſſion as to forget a little
the reſpect due to the houſe he was
in; he ſpoke ſo loud two or three
times, that all the family gathered
together at the ſtable door to know
what was the matter, and ſome of
them, to help againſt the Footman,
who in their apprehenſion was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108482:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
brought thither to none other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
but for his being ſoundly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>udgelled. Their talking about that
ſpent ſome while; my Lord being
ſurprized to ſee no attendants about
him, calls again and again, he cryeth,
no body cometh; at laſt he crawleth
a long as well as he could to a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
that looked into the yard, from
whence he ſaw all his ſervants in
allarm, he inquireth about the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their meeting, the ſervants
withdraw, and juſt now both my
Lady, the Major and the Footman
come out of the ſtable. The old
man who knew not what to think
of this uproar, troubleth himſelf,
and will know what paſſeth, one
tells him that my Lady had been
willing to have the Footman exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
about ſome new roguery he had
committed; but this anſwer did not
ſatisfy him, and he complained that
many things were concealed from
him, for which, ſaid he, that Raſcal,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108482:52"/>
deſerved, may be, the halter. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other ſervants there was on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
who had ſerved him above twelve
years, whom he truſted more than
the others; he commands him to
follow his Camrade, and pump ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
of him the ſecret of this buſineſs;
ſome glaſſes of Wine unty'd the
tongue of the fellow and he revealed
the whole myſtery to his friend
who immediately acquainted his
Maſter with it. The old man was
vexed at the tidings, and fell into
ſo great ſuſpicions that at table he
could not forbear to ſay in preſence
of my Lady and others, that the laſt
age was a very troubleſome thing,
and that amongſt other imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
it had this, to ſerve as a ſport to
young folks, but, for his part, he
was more clearſighted than one
could imagine. The pain he took
in unfolding this ſo imbroil'd mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of intereſt between the Major,
<hi>Lyſandre</hi> and his wife, brought him
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108482:52"/>
into a deep melancholy, which,
indeed, haſtened his death, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
watched more carefully over
the conduct of his young Spouſe, he
looked upon the Major with an ill
eye, and prepared nothing more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to <hi>Lyſandre.</hi> The Major
abſented himſelf for ſome days, he
was ſore vexed for the Footmans
perfidy, jealous and incenſed againſt
<hi>Lyſandre,</hi> impatient for his Colonels
coldneſs; but, over all, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
mad to ſee himſelf going for a
cheat in his Miſtreſſes heart. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
matters concerning the
regiment, ingaged him ſome weeks
after to go and confer with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel,
but he found always <hi>Berenice</hi>
near his elbow-chair, in ſo much
that he could by no means juſtify
himſelf to her; in the mean while
<hi>Lyſandre</hi> arriveth, the happy ſucceſs
of his negotiation ſets him up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in the Colonels eſteem, who
ſeemed to have appointed him in his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108482:53"/>
favour the ſame rank that the Major
had before.</p>
                  <p>How equal and moderate ſo ever
<hi>Lyſandre</hi> was in his growing fortune,
yet the Major did no more look upon
him, but with eyes full of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and take his moderate carriage
for a Pride, even to reproach
him one day, that he bore heels high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than ordinary; and you, lower,
reparteed boldly <hi>Lyſandre:</hi> Yes, to
make the better a paſs, added the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Captain who conceived
well enough this ſwaggering man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of challenge, anſwered ſtoutly,
<q>and I, ſaid he, I have got a pair at
home of the ſame ſort, that may do
me a good ſervice on a like occaſion.</q>
                     <q>I would fain ſee them, replyed the
Major;</q> to which <hi>Lyſandre</hi> having
anſwered, he would procure him
that ſport the very next morning
without the gate of <hi>Jermany,</hi> they
ingaged and went away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:108482:53"/>
All this while things were very
peaceable within the Colonels fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<hi>Berenice</hi> had made her ſelf ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Miſtreſs of her old decrepits
mind, that ſhe handled and turned
him which way ſhe pleaſed, but
eſpecially ſince the diſcovery of the
Footman ſhe had ſo ſtrongly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
him by her conſtant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon him and her flattering
manners, that his ſuſpicions were
quite blotted out of his weak brain,
ſhe gets the Major acquainted with
it, her policy perſwaded her to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
him, and, indeed ſhe ſacrificed
to that man, juſt as the antients did to
plague and to feaver, not to get any
benefits of them, but leſt they ſhould
ſuffer miſchief from theſe hurtful
divinities. The preſumptuous Major
taketh a favourable Omen through
this kind advice, and reſolveth to
come and ſhew her how ſenſible he
is of it, immediately after the duel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
between him and <hi>Lyſandre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:108482:54"/>
This appointment came to the ears
of <hi>Berenice</hi> the very ſame day it was
made, by an Enſign of the Regiment,
ſhe could not ſleep all the night long,
being in a deadly apprehenſion; leſt
the Major who looked ſtronger and
brisker than her dear beloved Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
ſhould get the better of
him; yet her Soul was too noble,
to oppoſe ſo courageous a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
All that ſhe could do in her
favourites behalf was to intreat the
Enſign not to permit the fight grow
too hot, and in his depoſitions to
put the Major in the wrong. This
young Cavalier who had no great
love for the Major, and gloried to
ſerve a Lady of ſo great merit, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
her, ſhe would have cauſe to
be content of his carriage, and then
took his leave.</p>
                  <p>An hour after the opening of the
gates our Rivals were followed by
the Enſign, we ſpoke of, and a
Lieutenant, both of the ſame Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

ſpared for his ſake; Eſſences,

Now 'tis time to come and

Here's the Letter by which he begs

goeth out that very day,
and pays his Civilities to the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
in whoſe preſence he gave his

The old mans indiſpoſition giving
no opportunity of a long diſcourſe
with him; he went on to my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Chamber, he found her alone,
and was ready to throw himſelf at
her feet, but ſhe prevented him. <q>I
am in the utmoſt confuſion, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,

<hi>Berenice</hi> in the utmoſt joy, to ſee
you again, and I am confident,
yours ſhall not be leſs than mine
own, when you know out of my
mouth that his highneſs, who was
not acquainted with your quarrel,
gratifies you with the place of
Lieutenant Colonel, and, it may
be, you'l receive the commiſſion
the next poſt. In the mean while

forget your ſelf in your new prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I, Madam, forget my ſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
he; I, who know better than
any man in the world, how great
is the inconſtancy of fortune! Ah!
let rather heaven—No no, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
be ye not afraid for that.</q>
They were apt to go further, if
my Lords Gentleman had not come
in, to warn <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> his maſter
would ſpeak with him; he took his
leave of my Lady, and got imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by the bed of the Colonel,
who bid him to go in his name and
ſet at liberty the Major with whom
he intreated him to be reconciled;
he put his ſuperiours order in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108482:59"/>
The Major was ſet at liberty,
and they ſupped together talking the
ſpace of two hours of nothing but
indifferent matters, the Major being
free came to thank the Colonel and
ſhew his gratitude to <hi>Berenice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not true, the Prince had
himſelf made choice of <hi>Lyſandre</hi>
to fill the vacancy, but true it was,
<hi>Berenice</hi> had prepared her husband
to be favourable to him; her husband
I ſay, to whoſe prudence and wiſdom
his highneſs had truſted the election
of a worthy Officer; a myſtery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
which was hidden to the Major,
who would have taken quite other
meaſures, if he had had the good
luck to diſcover it; he continued to
give his frequent attendances upon
the Colonel, and did almoſt never
meet there <hi>Lyſandre:</hi> which he took
as a good Omen, there being but
that onely Cavalier that might ſtand
in competition and diſpute the
Lieutenancy with him. <hi>Berenice,</hi> to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108482:59"/>
keep her Intreague more private,
did often ſpeak to him of <hi>Lyſandre</hi>
as a man who had nothing of that
greatneſs of Soul, of that firmneſs
of courage, which was neceſſary in
a Warriour; to which feigned ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the Major added ſome true
ones of his own ground, no leſs
diſhonourable than the former;
Nay, ſometimes in her preſence he
called him a ſimple fellow, and told
her one day, he was in a merry hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
he had play'd him a witty
turn; <q>this Officer, Madam, ſaith
he, commanded before yeſterday
the Guard at <hi>Wick,</hi>
               </q> he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
a ſplendid entertainment for
his friends, and given order, it ſhould
be brought up to the Guard; I knew
one of my Drummers, was to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Pottages and fricaſſes. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
him two Piſtols, if in the very
midſt of the great ſtreet, he would
let fall down his burthen by feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to fall down himſelf. It was
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108482:60"/>
done ſo, indeed, the Drummers
foot ſlipped, all ſlipped alſo out of
his hands, and the diſhes, through
the help of half a dozen of ſpoons
borrowed of the Neighbours, were
filled with an hundred naſty things,
which were eaten up with the
greateſt avidity in the world. The
trick is noble and witty, ſaid cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Berenice,</hi> but now you put
me in mind of him, I believe, 'tis
he that is below, let us go down,
and laugh at his coſt, in my Lords
Chamber: they got in before him,
and had already taken ſeats by the
bed, where the gout detained the
old man, when <hi>Lyſandre</hi> came in.
The Colonel againſt his cuſtom,
pulled off his cap to him, which
the Major admired at, but he was
far more amazed when he wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
him, not with one good
morrow, maſter <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> but with
one, maſter Lieutenant Colonel ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
welcome. This Complement
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108482:60"/>
was like a Thunder-bolt that took
almoſt away from the Major the uſe
of his Speech, although he had yet
ſome belief, the Colonel ſpoke but
in jeſt; he altered preſently his
mind, for the Colonel bid his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
to draw out behind his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
two Letters one of which he
gave to <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> ſaying, <q>Sir, out
of gratitude you are ingaged to
ſerve faithfully his Highneſs, he
honours you with the vacancy, and
for my part, I eaſe my ſelf upon
you of the care of the regiment;
you ſee in what condition both my
age, and infirmities have brought
me;</q> I believe I ſhall not go long.
Don't take the pains to go to the
<hi>Hague.</hi> The Prince diſpenſeth you
with that duty, and alloweth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptively
your thanks.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Lyſandre</hi> was buſie about
thanking the Colonel with the
ſtrongeſt and warmeſt expreſſions
that juſt and true gratitude can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108482:61"/>
the Major turning his eyes, full
of anger and ſpight, towards my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
ſaw her fetching a deep ſigh,
lifting up her ſhoulders, and caſting
aſide upon <hi>Lyſandre</hi> deſpiſing and
diſdainful looks, he could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
her to be concern'd in that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair;
yet could he not forbear with a
low voice to ſay, <q>Madam, had I more
obey'd intereſt and ambition than
love, this bit had not eſcap'd out of
my hands: I was in wrong to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the Journey to the <hi>Hague;</hi> this
is the ſecond time I act my ſelf ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
God grant I may not play the
ſame a third time by loſing you:</q>
To which ſhe anſwer'd, <q>Sir, it is
like Heaven hath ordain'd you to
ſome higher fortune, diſpenſe me
with a further explication; be ye
but conſtant and diſcreet.</q> In the
mean while the old man was falling
aſleep; ſo, not to diſturb him longer,
the company roſe up, and my Lady
ſtaid alone near the bed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:108482:61"/>
The Major being return'd back
into his houſe, made ſo grave and
ſo earneſt reflections upon the
myſterious dealing of <hi>Berenice,</hi> that
he plainly convinced himſelf, ſhe
was the only Author of his Rivals
advancement; and that, indeed, not
without a great deſign under hand:
he concluded further, that all the fair
countenance ſhe ſhew'd him, was
but a counterfeit kindneſs, and that
her heart was driven quite another
way: Therefore he reſolved after a
long meditation, to try this ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Sphynx</hi>'s fidelity by a Love-letter,
which he got written and directed
to himſelf as from another Miſtreſs.
He let it fall down in <hi>Berenice</hi>'s
Chamber, in ſuch a place where ſhe
could not miſs to ſee and take it up;
being confident, her Jealouſie would
infallibly break out, if ſo be ſhe had
a true love for him. In effect <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
took up the Letter, in which,
after his going out, ſhe read theſe
lines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:108482:62"/>
If there be in the world a perplex'd
love, it is mine, dear Major. 'Tis in
vain for you to renew every day to me
the proteſtations of that tender and
ſolemn engagement, we ſwore one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the beginning of our mutual
flames. 'Tis in vain for you to aſſure me
with ſo much earneſtneſs, that you love
me ſtill without any diviſion of your
heart. I have follow'd you, I know the
abode of the object of your vows, and
that your exact attendance upon your
Colonel, is not ſo much to court an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
fortune, as to ſacrifice your
heart to that Goddeſs, who makes ſport
of ſo many Gallants as well as of you.
'Tis true, indeed, ſhe is inrich'd with
all the graces that may enſlave noble
ſouls; but ſhe knows it very well, 'tis
enough, I ſay no more. You ought to
combine with a perſon that preſumes
not ſo highly of her ſelf, and whoſe
love is grounded upon a true and juſt
apprehenſion of your merit. If you
find me too ſevere, 'tis perhaps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108482:62"/>
you are not cold enough; grow
more private, then you ſhall not meet
with a ravenous Miſtreſs: Your love
will be the meaſure of mine; reſolve
quickly upon this declaration: Dear
Major, adieu.</p>
            <p>All this allarm'd very little our
cunning Lady; be it, ſhe took the
Letter to be a fruit, either of the
Major's brain, or of the paſſion of
ſome jealous Miſtreſs; ſhe had ſo
little tendency to him, that ſhe was
by no means troubled at it. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
ſmelling well enough to
what purpoſe the Letter ſlipp'd out
of the Majors pocket, ſhe contrived
with her dear <hi>Lyſandre</hi> to pay the
fool with his own coin: ſo ſhe
wrote the following lines, which
ſhe left on her <hi>Toilette,</hi> where ſhe
foreſaw, the curious Major would,
no doubt, ſet his hands.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>I beg your pardon, Madam, if I take
upon me to ſay, that a perſon as witty
as you are, ought not to be ſo much
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108482:63"/>
credulous. The Major, who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
look'd upon you as the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Lady in this Town, would account
his inclinations wronged, if he could ſet
them in another place. I confeſs, the
Letter, you ſent me, is able to breed
jealouſie in a true loving heart: but
who can warrant you, that it is not a
trick put upon him by ſome one of thoſe
many jealous Cavaliers, who repineth
at his fortune? It may be, ſome of them
are plotting againſt his happineſs, and
would have him ruin'd in your heart,
which he knows well enough to be a
great hater of perfidy. For my part,
I can't adviſe you to condemn upon ſo
flight conjectures, a Lover, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
is guilty upon no other account,
but becauſe he is too faithful to you.
I know the Major he doth not ſhift his
inclinations as his apparel: but would
I were you, I would conceal him nothing
at all; I would open freely to him the
Myſterie of the Letter, and, over all,
obſerve curiouſly his countenance, his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108482:63"/>

This is, in my mind, the way you

The next morning, no purpoſe, ſhe

betray'd your diſſimulation, and I
may bring forth authentical Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of that I ſay.</q> 
               <q>Pray, Madam, explain your ſelf, interrupted the
Major, who feign'd not to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the meaning of her diſcourſe; 
and your ſelf, reparteed ſhe, Search
your own heart, and examine your
conſcience.</q> At that word he puts
his hand in his pocket, as to ſeek
there for ſomething; and affected
to appear a little out of countenance,
when <hi>Berenice</hi> preſented him his
Letter, ſaying, 
<q>Trouble no more
your ſelf, here is that you look for.
This Note hath cleared all my
doubts.</q> 
               <q>What did ye learn by it,
Madam,</q> reply'd the Major? 
<q>To
right my ſelf, Sir, and confeſs, I am
not the only Goddeſs, before whom
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108482:64"/>
you burn your Incenſe, that you
bring it upon other Altars; and to
ſpeak plain, that you court &amp; abuſe
more than one.</q> 
               <q>Ah, Madam, ſaid
the Major, Let not this Note alter
in the leaſt, that eſteem I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in your mind. 'Tis true,
it came from a Lady; but how evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
is it, that my love for her is
but a paſtime; by the War, ſhe
declares to my coldneſs, &amp; through
thoſe many motives, ſhe uſes to ſtir
up my too great indifferency for
her?</q> This reaſon being likely
enough, ſeem'd to <hi>Berenice</hi> to be of
a great weight, and ſhe ſhewed her
ſelf much ſatisfied with it. On the
other ſide, our Major was extreamly
content with the happy ſucceſs of his
Intreague, and tickled himſelf more
than ever with the moſt charming
hopes in the World; when on a
ſudden, fortune, to make ſport of
him, put him a freſh to a new tryal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:108482:65"/>
               <hi>Lyſandre</hi> had promiſed to my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Gentlewoman, that, after his
being promoted to the Lieutenancy,
he would preſent her with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
ſute of Cloath; he had now
performed his word, as to the ſute,
but being it was not ſo rich as that
proud maid would have it, or that
it was not made according to the
rules of the new mode, or to her
own fancy, however ſhe would not
accept of it, and upbraided <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre</hi>
with a thouſand reproaches
of his covetouſneſs and inſipid
judgement. It was vain to my Lady
to bid her ſilence, ſhe grew hot more
and more, and ſeveral times got
him quite out of countenance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that one day my Lady was
forced to ſend her packing into her
Chamber. As ſhe was walking
down the ſtairs that led to the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
apartment, ſhe chanced to meet
with the Major, who, ſeeing her
ſo much moved, gets along with her
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108482:65"/>
into the room, offers to comfort her,
and asketh the cauſe of her tears.
She was in ſo great a paſſion that
forgetting the unviolableneſs of the
ſecret, and breaking all the bonds
of her duty, towards her Miſtreſs
and <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> ſhe declared all to the
Major. This unthought opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to make her ſpeak, ſeemed to him
ſo fair and ſo favourable, that he
ſpared nothing to ſet her upon an
intimate confidence; but, indeed, he
know there a great deal more than
was expedient for his own tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and he confeſſed ingenuouſly,
that he was abuſed at an high rate,
and had till now handſomely acted
his Self-Rival.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they were in conference,
my Lady ſent a Footman to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Major was ingaged with the
Colonel. This fellow being ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the waiting-maid, becauſe
ſhe had done him a diſcourteſy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
that my Lord was alone, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108482:66"/>
the Major locked up with her in her
Chamber, that through the lock-hole
he ſaw them both ſitting very
cloſe upon the bed, but they ſpoke
too low, to be heard. The Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
withdrew, and my Lady turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Lyſandre;</hi> 
               <q>No doubt, my
dear, ſaith ſhe, we are betrayed.
That ill Tongue will have revealed
all; but no matter, methinks, we
are gone further than half the way
to the aim we have propoſed to our
ſelves. If I can diſcover, that his
inconſiderate maid hath declared
any ſecret of mine, I will puniſh her
according to the exceſs of her Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and turn her away immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</q>
That fear, indeed, was not
groundleſs, for the Major who
judged that through the intereſt
of that Gentlewoman, he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
all the pretenſions of his Rival,
made her a thouſand advantagious
promiſes to draw her in to be of his
ſide, and amongſt other ſhining
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108482:66"/>
               <q>propoſals gave her the hope of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
with his own Nephew who
was an Enſign; or elſe that he
would get her a conſiderable place
near a Dutcheſs, with whom, ſaid
he, he had an intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
She took at that bait, and
not only unfolded him all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of her Miſtreſſes intreagues
with <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> but alſo ingaged her
faith to do whatever ſhe could for
his ſervice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>After dinner my Lady took her
apart, and firſt prepared her mind
by kind words to a downright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the truth, aſſuring her,
<hi>Lyſandre</hi> would mend his fault and
ſee her content of his liberality.
Then ſhe asked her what was the
matter of her converſation with the
Major, all the while, they were
both locked up together in her
Chamber, and whether in her
tranſport ſhe let not ſlip any thing
contrary to her duty, and prejudicial
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108482:67"/>
to the intereſt of <hi>Lyſandre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
The treacherous Maid anſwered
cunningly, ſhe was paſt overſight,
that ſhe led him along with her, to
ſtop him from going up and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
her converſation with <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandre,</hi>
and that, as for the ſubject
of their talking, it had been all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
about her mothers death,
whoſe tidings were juſt now come
to her; that the Major had attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
her tears to that cauſe, and
ſpent all that while in giving her
Comfort in the ſad condition, ſhe
was in. <hi>Berenice</hi> took that for
ready money, kept her and uſed
her ſtill with as much privacy and
confidence, as before, concealing
from her none of her ſecret Love-tricks.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Major
pining away with impatience of
revenging both his unfaithful
Miſtreſs and his troubleſome Rival,
contrived the blackeſt Treaſon that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:108482:67"/>
can be imagined, he gets the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Letter written to the Colonel,
by an unknown hand, as from a
friend of his, who concerns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for his honour, but concealeth
his name for ſome Weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

                  <p>This curſed Letter produced all
the effect, the malicious Major could
expect, and awaked in the old mans
Soul thoſe former ſuſpicions which
time had almoſt ſtifled and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed;
For, without examining
whether the advice was true or
falſe, he gave himſelf over to the
motions which ſuch ugly a picture
may breed in a jealous heart. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
for his own gravity ſake
he thought fit to ſhew no alteration
in his carriage towards <hi>Lyſandre</hi>
and his wife, and that it would be
ſufficient, to appoint her the next
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108482:68"/>
Chamber, whither there was no
paſſage but through his own, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it would be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
comfort to him in his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
to have her always by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Berenice</hi> who ſuſpected nothing
from the Major, ſticked not to give
that ſatisfaction to her old bed-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and cheerfully changed her
apartment. Now the Lieutenant
Colonel and the Major come every
day exactly in waiting, but the old
man ſeems to have neither eyes nor
tongue, for the former; yet becauſe
none or little account was made of
what he was doing or ſpeaking,
<hi>Berenice</hi> thought <hi>Lyſandre</hi> ought not
to be much troubled for't, and told
him publickly that, the Majors voice
being ſtronger, it was no wonder if
he could be better heard of an old
man who had no more his ears of
five and twenty. Well, but he had
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108482:69"/>
another cauſe of trouble far more
grievous than that.</p>
                  <p>Whatever time, hour, or part of
the day he might chuſe to go into the

ſome delightful moments
with his dear Miſtreſs, he found
her always the unſeparable, but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful

who was over him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
troubleſome <hi>Argus;</hi> he was
conſumed with an ardent deſire to

finding no opportunity, he thought
Letters would ſerve his turn againſt
the watchful eyes of the old
man, and really wrote her the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
one which he impreſſed with
the hot character of his impatient
love. But how lamentable was the
ſort of this unhappy Letter? and
what a brook of tears did it draw
from the fair eyes of <hi>Berenice?</hi>

have reſolved to bring me to deſpair.
Is it not enough then to a ſingle man

                  <p>This Letter was ſlipped in one
day; <hi>Berenice,</hi> by Galantry let fall
her hanckerchief, to give <hi>Lyſandre</hi>
the pleaſure to take it up. She took
it in, and read it as ſoon as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
went out; one may imagine
with what tranſports of joy, ſhe
read a Letter that had nothing baſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108482:70"/>
in its ſtile, and ſpoke with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of its Authors paſſion; ſhe
read it again a great many times,
and then hid it in the pocket of
an under-petticoat. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
reflecting no more upon her
Letter, ſhe got her ſelf dreſſed in a
ſlighter apparel, and put not on
that petticoat. The waiting maid
folding it up, found out the Letter,
read it, and preſently made the
Major acquainted with the good
luck. They appointed and met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to conſult how to improve
ſo fair opportunity; after ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
on both ſides, that fooliſh crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
dazzled with the hope, the
Major would ſet up her fortune,
opined the firſt, that the fatal Letter
muſt fall into the hands of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
that would not fail to deal
with <hi>Lyſandre</hi> ſo ſeverely, that the
Major ſhould be revenged at an high
rate; but he, being unwilling to
appear in the leaſt concerned in that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:108482:71"/>
plot, to not incur the juſt reſentment
of a woman that never could forgive
him ſuch huge and inſign a Treaſon,
deſired her to find out a way that
might ſecure his reputation in caſe
of any diſcovery. <q>Well, Sir, ſaith
ſhe, if I am not miſtaken, this will
ſerve our turn very well. Some
day or other when my Lord is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
I will come ſoftly near his
bed. If he be aſleep, I'l let fall this
Letter down nigh the bed; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
I'l get down into the kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
from whence I'le ſend up the
little Page, to look about my Lord.
That ſimple boy ſeeing the Letter
upon the flower, will believe that
my Lord ſtirring let it fall from
his pillow, under which he is uſed
to keep all Papers that are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

again in his hands, and ſo we may
be confident, that the Letter ſhall
infallibly be read of him.</q> 
                     <q>Excellent
well, excellent well, cryed out the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108482:71"/>
Major, the ſtroke is ſure, nothing was
ever better concerted; but pray loſe
no time, make haſt, and be certain,
Ile, take care of your fortune.</q> It
was done, as ſaid. The Letter came
into the hands of the old man, who
after the reading of it ſtood a while
almoſt out of his ſenſe, but having
recollected his ſpirits, he ſaw as clear
as the Sun how true was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
friends Letter, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to revenge highly the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
<hi>Lyſandre,</hi> but firſt of all,
to not decide ſo ſleightly upon
ſo important a matter, he compared
the Letter by ſome others he had
received before from <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> and
it proved to be evidently of the
ſame hand; he maſtered his anger
till the afternoon, and then <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre,</hi>
the Major and <hi>Berenice</hi> ſitting
by his bed, he broke out after a
moſt ſurprizing manner, his face
was on a ſudden altered, tears drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
from his eyes, and after he had
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108482:72"/>
caſt the Company into a ſtrange
conſternation by a ſilence of half a
quarter of an hour, he addreſſed
to the Major and told him: Dear
<q>Major, I am much engaged to you;
ye thought to do me a ſervice wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of your affection, when you mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me to the alliance, I have made;
but, pray, did you foreſee it ſhould
diſhonour me for ever. I ſpeak ſo,
not upon ſuſpicions of jealouſie, but
my friends firſt, and next my own
eyes taught me, that I nouriſh in
this Lady, (pointing to <hi>Berenice)</hi>
the mortal enemy of my quiet and
life; and that I have advanced a
man, meaning <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> who pays
my favours with the moſt notorious
ingratitude that was ever heard of.
Do not truſt me, Dear Major, here
is to prove withal, the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of my complaints: read aloud
this Letter, ſaid he, giving it to him.
Since you were the witneſs of ſo
many benefits I beſtowed upon theſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108482:72"/>
two ungrateful perſons, you muſt
alſo be the judge of the cauſe, I
have to repent it.</q> The Major
could not refuſe to take the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but he thought it to be of
his policy to beg his being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
with the reading of it: But
the Colonel inſiſted upon reading,
with ſo much earneſtneſs, that it
was not in his power to avoid
obeying any longer. So the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was read. A mortal paleneſs
diffuſed it ſelf all over the face of
<hi>Lyſandre,</hi> and <hi>Berenice</hi> became as
red as Scarlet: Confuſion and ſhame
ſtopp'd up their Speech, and there
was none but the Major who durſt
ſpeak. <q>My Lord, my Lord, ſaith
he, you know it, 'tis not a new
thing for good people to be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.
The ſolideſt Vertue is that
which ſtands the moſt cruel aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults;
all that your imagination
repreſents unto you is a meer
dream. I know too much my
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:108482:73"/>
Lady, to think her capable of
ſuch infidelity, and Maſter Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Colonel
will alſo give me
leave to ſay, not by way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
but to do Juſtice to his
Vertue, that he is the moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Gentleman in the World, and
by conſequence, the moſt unfit of
men to abuſe you at ſuch a rate.
This Letter was directed to you by
ſome foe of his; and we need no
other proof of it but this, that
'tis not his own hand? What d'you
ſay, replyed eagerly the old man,
pray be not ſo complaiſant as to
maintain things againſt your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
I am acquainted with
his hand, the Character of this
Letter is no way different from
that of a Letter he wrote me from
the <hi>Hague.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <q>Judge it your ſelf
without any prejudice, ſaid he,
ſhewing him the other, take my
part, and approve of my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
againſt thoſe that contrive
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:108482:73"/>
to haſten my death, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming
my Soul with ſorrow.</q>
The Major, to humour him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
the two Letters one to the
other, and ſaith, <q>That indeed they
had ſomething like, but the laſt
was counterfeit; as for example,
this <hi>p,</hi> ſaid he, My Lord, hath
no reſemblance at all with that <hi>d,</hi>
nor this <hi>c</hi> with that <hi>e,</hi> no more
than an hundred other letters I
could examine, if you would leave
them to my Judgement.</q> The
old man taking up the Speech, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<q>You are, Sir, a very graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Judge, and for my quiet ſake,
I will give the lye to the truth it
ſelf, and make blind my own
eyes, to have occaſion to forgive
them both.</q> All this while <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
had kept her peace, and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what ſhe could bring forth for
her vindication: She ſpoke at laſt,
and having ſaid, <q>That her innocence
might be ſlandered, but never ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</q>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:108482:74"/>
ſhe gave liberty to tears, which
dropped from her charming eyes
with ſo much profuſion, that they
excited thoſe of <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> nay of the
Major himſelf. <hi>Lyſandre</hi> next ſaid,
<q>he was not capable of the perfidy
he was accuſed of; that Maſter
Major had reaſon to aſſure, his hand
was maliciouſly imitated, and that
if his aſſiduous attending upon a
perſon to whom he was obliged for
his fortune, did ſo much incenſe
envy againſt him, he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
coming into his Colonels
houſe; So that the moſt urgent
buſineſſes could ſcarce engage him
to ſtep in.</q> He had no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his ſpeech, but the old man who
was ſtill in his mind convinced of
the fact, deſired my Lady to wipe off
her tears, and ſhew him through
her unwearied cares the falſhood of
the imputation that was put upon
her. They all roſe up upon that, and
my Lady was ready to go and give
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108482:74"/>
her ſelf over to tears and ſighs in her
Chamber, when the old man who
foreſaw it, intreated her not to leave
him, and to ſtay by his bed. That
crafty Woman, that was not half ſo
much anguiſhed as ſhe ſeemed,
threw her ſelf into the boſome of the
old man whom ſhe imbraced ſo long,
and upon which ſhe ſhed ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of tears, that he was moved
by, and paſt in an inſtant, from a
violent paſſion to a ſweet one, whoſe
motions proved no leſs dangerous to
his life; for they cauſed ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
and ſo great an alteration in
the Oeconomy of his bodies humours,
that they were all wambled; his gout
left him on a ſudden, and allowed
him the free uſe of his hands and
feet; during three days he was feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no pain at all, and people croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into his houſe to congratulate him
for that kind of growing young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
But upon the third day by
two a clock in the afternoon, no body
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:108482:75"/>
but the Major and his Lady being
with him, he fell ſuddenly in a ſwoon
and was taken with a general weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in all his Members. His Gout
ſeized again on his hands and feet,
and aſcended to the heart, ſo that
they choaked him in a quarter of
an hours time: he had his mind ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſound to the laſt breath, and
embraced both his wife and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,
intreated the one to eſpouſe
highly the intereſt of that young
diſtreſſed Widow; and told the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that in caſe ſhe would after
his death chuſe a ſecond husband,
ſhe ought to prefer the Wiſdom,
Affection and Birth of the Major,
before any more eminent quality
that ſhould not be attended with
thoſe three parts: upon that he
deſired them to embrace one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his preſence, and then ſhut
up his eyes for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:108482:75"/>
Thus the Colonel having given
up the ghoſt, our Major thought
his deſigns brought about; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had uttered out a great deal
of Pious and Chriſtian flouriſh to
comfort her ſoul, he failed not to
turn to his advantage the laſt words
of the dead, and to let her remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
her engagements: but the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Lady, to be rid of him, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<q>That ſhe would never give
him any juſt cauſe of murmur:
that now ſhe was not in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to decide ſo weighty a matter,
her trouble being ſo great, that
either, Yes, or No, were all one
to her; but when time, which cures
the greateſt ſorrows, ſhould have
ſet again her mind in its former
tranquillity, then ſhe would not fail
to acknowledge the great benefits
ſhe had received of him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The funeral pomp being ended,
and the old Colonels Idea baniſht
with it, our two Rivals begun a freſh
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:108482:76"/>
to court the handſome Widow.
The Major did never loſe the ſight
of <hi>Lyſandre;</hi> he had no ſooner ſeen
him ſtep into <hi>Berenice</hi>'s lodgings,
but there he followed him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
and was a conſtant and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
guard to him when he was alone
with her; inſomuch, that during two
months, <hi>Lyſandre</hi> look't in vain for
the opportunity of a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with his Miſtreſs, to give
her account of the progreſs of his
love. A certain day was appointed
in the uſual manner, for the exerciſe
of the Regiment out of the Town.
It was the Major's duty to attend
there; the Lieutenant Colonel ſent
him word, that he was a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed,
and could not be preſent
at the exerciſe; but the Major, who
was well, exempteth himſelf too,
and goeth to ſpend the morning
with the Widow. <hi>Lyſandre</hi> cometh
by nine a Clock, and meets there
with the Major, asked him, if the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:108482:76"/>
Regiment hath made well the Evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions;
and upon his anſwer, that
he believeth it: <hi>Lyſandre</hi> ſeeing he
had not been there, taxeth him with
a ſmall zeal, deſireth him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
from henceforth his duty, or elſe
he would complain to the Prince of
his negligence. The Major took
very ill this check, and ſpoke ſome
ſharp biting words to the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Colonel, who ſent him Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to his own houſe, intreating him
for his own profit, not to conſtrain
him to go further. The Laws of
Military obedience forbad the Major
to reply any more: he retired with
ſhame to his lodging, attended with
a deadly ſorrow, to leave ſo near his
Miſtreſs the moſt audacious and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
of his Rivals. All his
friends did intereſt themſelves in his
diſgrace; and becauſe the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
was now at Court, they made
their application for his liberty to
the Commander, who being a good
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:108482:77"/>
head-piece, would not be Judge of
either of the two faults, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to offend the Lieutenant
Colonel; ſo the Major was by all
means expoſed to the mercy of his
own Rival. To write him a letter,
the love of liberty adviſed him to
do ſo, but his courage deſcribed to
him that ſtep, as the moſt baſe and
unworthy of things. To write to
my Lady Colonel, he would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
expoſe himſelf to the ſcoffs of
the one and the other; and he would
not for all the world, go in her mind
for a man of low ſpirits. To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the Court with the matter, it
was to bear witneſs againſt his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and to depoſe againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
ſo he knew not what to do:
when Fate, leſs cruel, opened him
a way to triumph in his turn over
his Rival.</p>
                  <p>The Lieutenant Colonel was a
moderate man, out of whoſe mouth
nothing but rational was uſed to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108482:77"/>
ſlip. It fell nevertheleſs, that being
one day a drinking ſome Bottles of
Wine with the chief Officers of the
Garriſon, a motion was made about
the fair Widow; the diſcourſe
growing hot upon her concern, it
was there ſpoken of the Major, as
the man who carried it over all in
her amorous inclinations; that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
grew ſo general, that <hi>Lyſandre,</hi>
to deſtroy it, obſtinately bent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to maintain, that he knew a
man that was without compariſon
further in her favour than he. Every
one knowing, he meant himſelf,
made ſport to take the part of the
Major againſt him, and drove him
ſo far, that he fell a ſwearing, he
was ſure of what he ſaid; and that
the perſon he meant, had long ago
received authentical tokens and
exceptionleſs teſtimonies of it. This
was reported with a poiſoning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
to <hi>Berenice,</hi> who was ſo
much diſpleas'd at <hi>Lyſandre</hi>'s indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108482:78"/>
that her love for him
cooled to that point, as to forbid
him her houſe for ever.</p>
                  <p>The Major heard with a ſingular
pleaſure his Rivals diſgrace; he
preſently taketh Pen and Ink, to
praiſe <hi>Berenice</hi> for the Juſtice ſhe
had done to the moſt ungrateful
man in the World, and intreat her
to make her intereſt to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
who was returned for, his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
<hi>Berenice,</hi> who could not
live without being adored, and was
earneſtly incenſed againſt <hi>Lyſandre,</hi>
was raviſhed with joy to receive
tydings from the Major, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for him a tender love: ſhe

not different from the Copy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

engaged me to ſpeak him ſharp words

One muſt be <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> to

Now, Madam, if the noble Inclination

            <p>This Letter charmed the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>Berenice;</hi> ſhe felt her ſelf
moved with pity and love for the
Major; ſhe went ſtraightway to the
Governour, told him, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
was kept in arreſt upon the
ſlight account of a pique, that ſhe
was witneſs of the quarrel, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
how the Lieutenant Colonel
did ſo much abuſe his authority, as
to make it the tool of his paſſion.
This humble Petition preſented by
ſuch a Lady, got the liberty of the
Major, who ſcarce was got twelve
ſteps from his lodging, when he met
with his Jaylor. <hi>Lyſandre,</hi> who
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108482:79"/>
knew nothing of his being ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
by the Governours command,
asked him haughtily, Who made
him ſo bold, as to go out without his
leave? To which having been anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a ſcoff, the Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
drew; the Major ſtood firm; but
as the fortune of Arms is uncertain,
ſo, he was almoſt mortally wounded.
The Lieutenant Colonels action was
generally blamed. The Governour
was not a little offended at it, and
<hi>Berenice</hi> concerned her ſelf for the
Major, who had this unvaluable
comfort, that he received from her
all the good offices he might expect
from his own Mother. But O in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy
of fortune! this humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Divinity flattered him a while,
but indeed it was only to get by him a
richer and fatter Victim to her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prices.
It ſeem'd <hi>Berenice</hi> had quite
forgot <hi>Lyſandre:</hi> Nevertheleſs, as
the piques of lovers turn commonly
into a renewing of love; ſo <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>

was no ſooner met and ſaluted
in her Coach by him, but ſhe felt
within her heart he was no more
guilty, but ſtill worthy of her love.
<hi>Lyſandre,</hi> who had obſerved, through
the gentle manner and ſweet air
wherewith ſhe bowed to him, that
ſhe was appeaſed, got in her favour,
and kindled again her flames by this
Note.</p>

diſguiſed her ſelf a little; but the
converſation being by degrees
grown hot, the eyes having ſecretly,
but eloquently, ſpoken on both
ſides; and the fire by which theſe
two hearts were burnt, being kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
again more than ever, it was
talked no more but of re-union;
next, faith was given and accepted
of either party, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of any living ſoul: The Banes
were publiſhed three <hi>Sundays</hi> one
after another; and there was no
Officer of the Garriſon that heard of
it; becauſe, indeed very few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them do exactly go to
Church.</p>
            <p>One day, the Lieutenant Colonel
and the Major met by chance at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renice</hi>'s
houſe; ſhe obliged them to
be reconciled, which they did, and
both continued to court peaceably
their common Miſtreſs: but the
Major, who had no ſuſpicion of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
acted the Rival of himſelf
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108482:81"/>
for the third and laſt time, when
he was the leaſt thinking on it.
A circle of Gentlemen and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
met the firſt of <hi>July</hi> at the
fair Widows lodging: After ſome
diſcourſes upon meer indifferent
matters, my Lady roſe up, took the
Contract of her Matrimony with
<hi>Lyſandre,</hi> out of a Drawer; and
rolling it up within her hands, came
to the Major, and perplexed his
mind with this Propoſition; <q>Maſter
Major, ſaid ſhe, you, that are the
moſt complaiſant of men, and
make to your ſelf an inviolable
Religion, to refuſe nothing to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
will you grant me the favour
which I have a mind to ask you?
Yes with all my heart, replyed the
Major, with his hand on his breaſt:
What is it Madam? Muſt I ſhed
my deareſt blood for you? I will
ſacrifice it to the laſt drop.</q> 
               <q>No
Sir, added <hi>Berenice,</hi> it matters only
to ſign a Writ:</q> 
               <q>I will with all my
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:108482:82"/>
heart, though I muſt ſign my own
Condemnation: and if both your
Piety and Loyalty were not known
to me, I would know, whether
there be any thing contrary to the
Religion or State.</q> 
               <q>No, no, Sir,
it witneſſeth nothing elſe but your
free and voluntary conſent to my
everlaſting happineſs.</q> 
               <q>To your
happineſs, Madam, interrupted the
Major, Ah! blood muſt be uſed for
that glorious conſent.</q> He offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to prick himſelf with a Pin,
but <hi>Berenice</hi> took him from that
new extravagancy, putting a Pen
in his hand. So he ſigned the Paper
as it was rolled up; but as ſoon as
he had taken up his fingers from it.
<hi>Berenice</hi> laughing, made him know,
he had ſubſcribed the very Contract
of Marriage between her and <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre.</hi>
This ſtroke would, no doubt,
have killed him, if he had not
thought it to be a paſtime. He
was invited to make one in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:108482:82"/>
Wedding Feaſt againſt the next
morning. He came, believing ſtill,
as hard as Iron, it was but a meer
ſport. He lent all his jovial hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to the entertainment and
other rejoycings that followed it;
he ſung a great many Airs upon
Lovers unſhaken fidelity, he danced
with the Company till night: but
he began to alter his Tune, when
he ſaw all the Convives contending
one with another for the honour of
bedding <hi>Berenice</hi> and <hi>Lyſandre;</hi> yet
the ſtrong opinion he had, it was
but a play, cauſed him to do ſtill an

the Shoos of <hi>Berenice,</hi> he helped <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandre</hi>
in the pulling off his Coat, and
ſaw them both a minute after with
a wonderful amazement within
