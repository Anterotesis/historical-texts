            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Manie and great plagues hath this our land taſted of in times paſt, and it is not yet tenne yeares ſince this Citie of <hi>London</hi> was viſited and afflicted with this ſicknes, diſperſing it ſelfe into diuers and many places of this land, cutting off and taking away a great multitude of people: and I doubt not but ſin was a great cauſe thereof. O that man would therefore remember the inconſtancie and ſrailtie of this life! And conſider the end of his creation was to ſerue and glorifie God: but we daily diſhonour him by committing of ſinne, and not giuing vnto him that honor and ſeruice that is due vnto the Lord: But placing all our affections vpon the vaine delights and inconſtant pleaſures of this alluring and deceitfull world, which do as it were bewitch vs, and withdrawe vs from that Chriſtian care that we ought to haue of our ſaluation, abuſing Gods mercie and long ſufferance with our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1395:7"/>
and procraſtination to turne vnto him, being miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deluded by ſatan, and intiſed by the glittering ſhewes of this world, to the loue thereof; and God knowes how ſoone we muſt leaue it. I pray God infuſe his grace and holy Spirit into our hearts, that ſinne may be mortified in vs, and that it may worke in vs a reformation and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life: &amp; that we may henceforth walk in this our ſhort pilgrimage, as Chriſtians and ſeruants of the Lord, ſeruing him in all holineſſe and pietie of life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the vaine pleaſures of this fraudulent world, which are but ſnares to intrap our ſoules, and the baites of Sathan to draw vs vnto deſtruction: then ſhall we not need to feare death, but ſay with Saint <hi>Paul, Mors mihi lucrum, Death vnto me is gaine,</hi> ſaith he: ſo is it indéed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the godly: but vnto the wicked it is an entrance into a continuall and eternall puniſhment: from the which Chriſt that hath died for vs, deliuer vs. Amen.</p>
            <p>Now hauing ſhewed ſin to be one cauſe of the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſometimes the onely cauſe, when it pleaſeth God to puniſh the impietie of his people, vſing it as the executioner of his wrath: it followeth that I ſhewe the other cauſes, whereof the Peſtilence may ariſe.

            <p>The firſt cauſe whereby the aire may bée corrupted, is through the vnholſom influence of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> planets; who by their malitious diſpoſition, qualitie, and operations, diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, alter and corrupt the aire, making it vnholeſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to humane nature.</p>
            <p>When the temperature of the aire is changed from his naturall eſtate, to immoderate heate and moiſture, <note place="margin">Note.</note> then it corrupteth and putrifieth, and ingendreth the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence.

            <p>The third cauſe of the peſtilence, is the euill diſpoſition of the body, which is bred by euill diet: the bodie being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat with corrupt and ſuperfluous humors, which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors bereadie to putrifie and rot vpon anie light occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And when ſuch a perſon doth but receiue into his bodie by inſpiration, the corrupted and infections aire, he is therewith by and by infected, his bodie being diſpoſed

            <p>Now hauing ſhewed the remedies for the two firſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1395:10"/>
cauſes; it followeth, that I teach the cure of the third and laſt cauſe, which is the euill diſpoſition of the body, through ſuperfluous, corrupt, and euill humors aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Here is the cauſe, and theſe corrupt and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humors muſt be taken away before the body can bée in any good eſtate of health. And this is the reaſon that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers perſons liuing together in one aire, that one is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and not another, namely, the diſpoſition of the body: for thoſe naughtie, corrupt, &amp; ſuperfluous humors, are of themſelues apt and diſpoſed vnto putrefaction, and if it ſo chance that they do putrefie of themſelues, then there ariſe dangerous feuers, according vnto the nature of the humor that corrupteth. As for example, If choler do putrifie within the veſſelles, it ingendreth <hi>febris ardens</hi> or <hi>febris cauſon,</hi> a hot and a dangerous feuer, working his malice in the concauitie of the liuer and lunges and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the heart, &amp; except remedy be adminiſtred the perſon dieth. And ſo when any of the other humors doe putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, there ſpringe feuers, according vnto their nature, as the learned knowe. Now ſuch bodies (I ſay) wherein there is ſuch ſuperfluous humors abounding, in the time of any infection, receiuing into their bodies the corrupt <note place="margin">perſons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed.</note> and venemous aire, are thereby infected: And theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors turned not only into putrefaction, but into a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous qualitie, by the operation of the infectious aire Whereas in bodies voide and frée from ſuch ſuperfluous humors, there the infectious aire hath not ſuch matter to worke vpon: and againe, nature is more ſtrong and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt and expell a corrupt and infectious aire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though receiued.</p>
            <p>Here the reaſon is apparant why one perſon is infected and not another. And very niedfull it is eſpeciallie in this time of ſickneſſe, that this euill diſpoſition of the body be taken away and amended, by purging and euacuating of the perccant humors. For which purpoſe I wil ſet down a very excellent and approued potion, which purgeth the

            <p>Now if it ſo happen that your potion do not worke within two howers after the receiuing thereof, which is verie ſeldome ſéene in any body, then take a little of your broth, or if it be not readie a little thinne ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue, either of which will cauſe it to worke forthwith.

Celſus</hi> teach, and experience approueth.</p>
               <p>Idleneſſe and reſt is a contrarie vnto exerciſe: it is the mother of ignorance, the nurſe of diſeaſes, it corrupteth the mind, it dulleth the bodie, filling and repleating it with ſuperfluous and euill humours, which breede manie ſickneſſes. And as exerciſe and labour is a preſeruer of health, ſo idlenes is the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, enemy vnto the ſoule and body, and very vnprofitable in a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, and alſo hurtful in a priuate houſe. And remember this, that vehement exerciſe be not vſed preſently after meate, for it wil conueigh crude and vndigeſted iuyce vnto each part, which is very euil &amp; hurtfull. But exerciſe is good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meate, and two or thrée howers after meate, being moderately vſed. Exerciſe is beſt and moſt conuenient, when the firſt and ſecond digeſtion is complete, as well in the ſtomacke, as in the vaines. But in ſuch a time of infection as this is, I cannot commend exerciſe, becauſe it will too much open the pores, and the pores being opened, the bodie is apt to receiue the infectious aire. Much more would I ſay of the benefit of exerciſe, and the inconuenience of idleneſſe, but that I ſhould be ouer-tedious in this place.</p>

               <p>In the cure of this ſicknes there are thrée intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons eſpecially required. The firſt is to aide and helpe nature, to expell the infection and venemous poiſon. <note place="margin">3. <hi>Intentions required in the cure of this ſicknes.</hi>
                  </note> The ſecond is to comfort the heart, and other the principall members of the body. The third is a good obſeruation in diet, afterward to be vſed.
