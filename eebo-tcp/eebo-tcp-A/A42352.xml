            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>HAving lately received a printed Paper, entituled, <hi>Certain Heads or Propositions presented to the Kings most excellent Maiesty by the Army, which Propositions,</hi> as they are there entituled, goes under the notion of the whole army in general, which (as I conceive)
<pb facs="tcp:110519:3"/>
hath been fomented and contrived, by some wicked Instruments, who desire to make the breach wider, betwixt the Parliament and Army, rather then to bring it to a happy close and period.</p>
               <p>Therefore, thus much I dare presume to declare, in behalf of all my fellow-souldiers, that the army had not the least thought of contriving or presenting any such papers to his Majesty, to desire the stile or title of his army, or sending for his Royall Consort the Queen over, unlesse they conceived it might tend to the common good of the Kingdom; I have (to the utmost of my power, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to find out the authors or fomenters of the said paper, but cannot (in the least) find any man guilty of such an action. And therefore, it is further declared, that we doe not desire to change that title, which wee have for these 5 or 6 yeares endeavoured to maintain with the losse of our lives, having obtained many renowned Victories under the same; but according to our former En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, we desire to see the Kingdom set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in peace, his Majesty stated in his Royal
<pb facs="tcp:110519:3"/>
Palace at Westminster, and the priviledges of Parliament, and liberty of the subject, fully maintained and confirmed, our only aymes being to obtain a firme peace, and not a new Warre.</p>
               <p>The Governour of Warwick Castle doth not seem to hold correspondency with the army in their late Engagement, but doth ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly renounce and declare against the same. His Majesty moves according to the motion of the army, but upon his removall from the Earl of Salisburies house, the chiefe Officers of the army, proposed to his Majesty certain propositions, concerning his advance from thence, desiring to know what place his Maiesty had a desire to reside at the next night. His Majesty is very merry and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and desires to see London, His Majesty received his two Chaplains, Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> &amp; Dr. <hi>Shelden,</hi> very courteously, and (we hear) they have had a Conference together. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars, concerning the army, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to the ensuing papers. But by the next, you shall hear further from</p>

               <p>WE have in all things dealt cleerly and plainly with you, and hope we shall continue still to doe so: As soon as the worthy Aldermen, and the other two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, your Commissioners, came the last night to us, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with our purpose, to draw the Head-quarter to <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> that so we might contract our quarters, which have hitherto lyen scattered; at which place we hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that which will be satisfaction to the Kingdome, and will remove Obstructions out of the way of Justice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if right were done, we should let you and all the world see, That we would be so far from pressing near your city of <hi>London,</hi> it should bee indifferent to us, to march not only to the d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>stance prescribed, but to any part of the Kingdome we should be commanded to by the Parl. Wee have asked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hitherto but right, in the things that are knowne as if they were proved an hundred times before them from whom they have sought them; which if granted, would not only be a justice to the Army, but would let the Kingdome see the Fountain in a way to be cleared without which nothing of Force or Power would be a security to any man.</p>
               <p>We wish the name of Priviledges may not lye in the bal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lance with the safety of a Kingdom, and the reallity of a Kingdome, and the reallity of doing, Justice; which as wee wee have said so often, wee cannot expect whilest the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

we have accused are the Kingdomes and our Judges, a little delay will indanger the putting the Kingdome into bloud; notwithstanding, what hath been said, if it be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That in <hi>Wales,</hi> besides under-hand workings in your ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and other places, Men are raised, and that in no small number; and are not those men in the Parliament, who have continued faithful to the principles of common inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest from the beginning of this Par. to this very day still aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the concourse of Reformado-Officers and others to their doores; expence of time will be their advantage only, who intend to bring evill purposes to passe.</p>
               <p>We have written this to you for your satisfaction, that so nothing may be done, without giving you a perfect account of our intentions and ends, and still to continue our assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to you, that should necessity bring us nearer to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, our former Faith given you shall be observed inviolably, there being nothing more (next to the good of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) in our thoughts and desires, then the prosperity of your city.</p>
