            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PRINCESS
OF
Montferrat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
A
NOVEL.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>LEWIS</hi> of <hi>Montferrat</hi> was
a Prince who with the
qualities of a great <hi>Hero,</hi>
ſo abounded with thoſe
of a gallant Man, that he was
the Inclination of Ladies, as well
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41286:6"/>
as the eſteem of brave Men. He
was only heard ſpoken of in the
World; and never honour, nor
vertue had a better Example.
In the mean time with ſo many
reaſons that that Prince had to be
content with himſelf, he was
not, as People imagined. There
wanted ſomething to his felicity
which rendred him as all other
Men. He had Married a Wife of
an Illuſtrious Birth, of a Merit as
great as her Birth, and far more
than can be expreſſed; But by
whom after ten Years Marriage,
he had not had a Child, and
that diſpleaſure alone infected all
that there was agreeable in the
Glorious State of his Life. Vows,
Prayers and Alms were not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the <hi>Italians</hi> are much given
to them: At laſt Heaven ſeemed
to be moved, and ſent him a
Daughter as Fair and as Perfect,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41286:6"/>
as if ſhe had come from Heaven
it ſelf. This good Prince, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized
his Joy by a Fortnights
Feaſt, which he ordain'd through
all his Territory; but which was
cruelly interrupted by the Death
of the Marchioneſs, that happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a few days after her being
brought to Bed. There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeen in ſo little a time ſo much
Joy and ſo much Grief as in the
Heart of that Prince, who paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
loving his Wife, payed
very dear by ſo ſenſible a loſs, for
the Preſent Heaven had juſt made
him. He would have abandoned
himſelf a thouſand times to his
deſpair, without the extream ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
he had already conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for that Infant, whom he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as a Succour that had
been ſent him from above, againſt
the misfortune that was to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to him. It was without
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41286:7"/>
doubt the only thing that could
render him capable of ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and make him ſurvive the
Death of ſo aimable a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briſcida,</hi> it was thus, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
that Child, who had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſo much Beauty the firſt days
of her Birth, made appear, with
the ſuccours of ſome Years, a
thouſand times more than could
have been hoped. All ſeem'd to
augment in her from moment to
moment, and the Charms of her
Perſon, that would not have
been ſaid, at the Age of ten or
twelve Years, that they could
have mounted to a higher point
of perfection, encreaſed after in
ſuch a manner, that every day
one found in her ſome new Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Admiration. Her gate
alone had at that age ſomething
ſo great and ſo agreable together,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41286:7"/>
that ſhe drew the Heart as well
as the Eyes of all the World. I
deſign not to draw her Picture, I
could not, if I would, ſhe had a
thouſand things which cannot be
deſcribed, as her Eyes, her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
her Neck, her Arms,
her Hands; all in fine had in her
an extraordinary perfection, and a
Beauty very difficult to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
Yet all theſe Charming
viſible qualities were nothing,
when they were compared to
thoſe of her Soul, there was
found in her a vivacity of Wit,
and at the ſame time ſo ſolid a
Judgment, that ſhe ſurprized the
cleareſt Wits. She was never
ſeen to be deceived in any thing;
and her Penetration proceeded to
divine the greateſt Secrets. In
fine, if ever Soul appeared fair by
the bright marks of Vertue, it
was certainly that of that young
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41286:8"/>
Princeſs; the noiſe of her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ran far, and near: Nothing
was ſpoken of in Forreign Courts
but <hi>Briſcida,</hi> and all thoſe who
had ſeen her, and underſtood
Beauty, did agree that there was
not a finer Perſon, nor nothing
ſo rare to be ſeen in all <hi>Italy;</hi> that
fine Country, which has almoſt
always been the firſt Pilgrimage
of thoſe who have the leaſt loved
travelling, became in the time of
that Princeſs a common Road of
People, who had the leaſt Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity:
And <hi>Rome,</hi> that famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
never invited ſo many People
by all its famous Antiquities, as
<hi>Caſſal,</hi> by the Beauty alone of
<hi>Briſcida.</hi> It was the place where
ſhe reſided, as the ordinary reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Marqueſs of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat.</hi>
There was hardly a
young Prince or Lord in <hi>Europe,</hi>
who thought not himſelf obliged
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41286:8"/>
in Honour, to make thither a
Voyage, as a neceſſary point to
the reputation of a well-bred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and Monarchs, who could
not ſo far diſpence with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
took care to ſend thither
their Limners, to have the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of that fair Princeſs. From
thence it came, that the Court
of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which had been
formerly one of the leaſt of <hi>Italy,</hi>
was one of the moſt numerous,
as well as the moſt gallant of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
The Marqueſs, a Prince
who very well underſtood him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in all things, entertained
People there, with ſo much
Sweetneſs and Generoſity, that it
was ſtill a new Charm to invite
Strangers thither.</p>
            <p>So fair a Princeſs, Heireſs of a
State as that of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> was
without doubt a brave Match
for what Prince ſoever. Several
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41286:9"/>
had already aſpired to her: but
the Marqueſs, who extreamly
loved her, or rather, who loved
nothing in the World but that
Daughter, was not able to part
with her ſo ſoon.</p>
            <p>Amongſt all the Illuſtrious
Pretenders, was ſeen <hi>Lewis</hi> of
<hi>Bavaria,</hi> Count Palatine of the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> eldeſt Son of the Elector
of that Name. This Prince who
might aſpire to ſo fair a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
made appear in that Court
an extraordinary magnificence in
all things, and made his Love
much talked of. He was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
well made, and had Wit:
But there was ſeen in him a kind
of ſufficiency and contempt of all
others, which made him not
much beloved, eſpecially by the
Princeſs, who could not hinder
her ſelf in the leaſt Rancounters,
from ſhowing him how little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41286:9"/>
ſhe had for him. This
Prince was not at all diſcouraged,
he had more Ambition than
Love, and that firſt Paſſion is not
uſed to turn things to its diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
he dayly invented new
Parties of Hunting, Dancing,
Maſquerading, Turnaments, and
other the like Divertiſements:
wherein he always wone the
Prize, as well of Gallantry as of
bravery, ſpending at a rate that
ruined all thoſe who would imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
him. All theſe advantages,
rendred him fierce and proud, he
being likewiſe naturally ſo, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he made himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
to all the World. But
Fortune, who ſometimes pleaſes
her ſelf with reverſes, to abate
the pride of thoſe who too much
flatter themſelves with their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Succeſſes, made him meet
with a Gentleman more ſtrong
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41286:10"/>
than himſelf, and who cruelly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
him in all his Deſigns.</p>
            <p>It was at a famous Turnament
that this began, and of which the
Princeſs was to give the Prize.
The Count Palatine had already
done all there that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from a Gentleman, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as he. There was no body
more came to diſpute with him
the Prize, and the Princeſs was
upon the point of delivering it
him; when they ſaw a Man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the place, whoſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Countenance, and the good
Air he had on Horſe-back, made
all People at that inſtant judg he
was no common Perſon. The
Count ſtopped for ſometime to
behold him, and found, as well as
all others, he had ſomething
extream Warlike. He had no
other Train with him than a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of the Horſe, and a Page;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41286:10"/>
who carried his Lance. He was
ſet out after a rich and ſuperb
manner. His Arms glittered, and
had a marvellous effect in the
Sun, who being upon the end of
his Carreer, ſeemed only to ſpread
his Rays for the better ſparkling
of the Jewels he had about him.
The time preſſed them to engage,
and making only a half turn of
the Liſts, as a defiance to the
Count, who prepared to receive
him; he bowed his Lance, and
let his Horſe go, who came
thundring upon his Enemies
with an impetuoſity that never
had had the like. The Count
Palatine did almoſt the ſame
thing on his ſide: and being met
with a check, which reſembled
ſomething more furious than
that of two Men, their Lances
broke upon their Breaſts, through
the two terrible ſtrokes they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41286:11"/>
there. But their Force, their
Addreſs, or their Fortune were
not equal: for inſtead, that the
Unknown did only ſhake a little
in his Stirrups; the Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
after having wavered ſome
time in the Saddle, could not
keep himſelf there, but fell upon
the Ground. An advantage ſo
conſiderable over a Prince, who
was already the Conquerour of
all the others, caſt the Aſſiſtants
into ſo great an aſtoniſhment, that
they all ſhouted. It was not
known, who this valiant Man
was, he came into the Liſts with
his Helmet down, and all People
had a deſire to ſee him. The
Marqueſs <hi>de Montferrat,</hi> fancied
that he was <hi>Philippo Mario Viſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi>
a Prince much renowned for
the fine Actions he had done, and
who had already been ſeen in that
Court: and in that Opinon, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41286:11"/>
him approach to ſalute him;
You only hide your ſelf from us,
My Lord, ſaid he to him, to
make your ſelf more admired, and
the more agreeably ſurprize us;
But we are already ſo accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to all thoſe glorious Actions
you do every day, that how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
ſoever you would appear,
you would ſtill be diſcovered by
what you perform. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who never in his Life had
been at <hi>Caſſal,</hi> although he was
pretty well known to the Prince,
well perceived he was miſtaken,
and lifting up his Helmet, he let
him ſee inſtead of the Son of the
Duke of <hi>Milan; Gaſpard de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luces</hi>
only Son of the Marqueſs of
that Name; whom the Marqueſs
having ſeen ſeveral times at the
Army, was not in much trouble
to know. He immediately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
him, he carreſſed him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41286:12"/>
with the greateſt tenderneſs in
the World, and preſented him to
his Daughter, accompanying that
honour with a thouſand things
he ſaid to his advantage. <hi>Briſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
gave him the Prize of the
Turnament, with ſo much the
more pleaſure, that he had won
it from a Prince, for whom ſhe
had naturally but little kindneſs;
and to whom ſhe had ſome regret
of doing that honour, inſomuch
that there was then an agreeable
change in her mind, which by
the arrival of that Prince, paſſed
all of a ſudden from Vexation to
the Joy ſhe had of not being in
that pain: And perhaps it was to
that diſpoſition of contrary Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
that <hi>Gaſpard de Saluces</hi>
owed all the good reception ſhe
made him; for it is true, that ſhe
received him, not after her uſual
manner, and with that ſeverity,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41286:12"/>
ſhe was accuſtomed to receive all
thoſe of the like rank; but with a
ſweetneſs and ways ſo engaging
and ſo generous, that it ſeemed,
ſhe would in ſome faſhion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the kindneſs he had
juſt done her.</p>
            <p>That amiable Princeſs who
had Charms enough, without
producing new ones, at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
ſo powerfully ſurprized the
Eyes and the Soul of that young
<hi>Hero,</hi> that he remained almoſt
without Motion; his Courage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
him, and he loſt his
very Speech: But his ſilence, his
Eyes and all the actions of his
Perſon ſpoke for him, and made
the Princeſs know a part of the
Joy he had in ſeeing her. The
Marqueſs, who began at firſt to
ſpeak very obligingly of him,
gave him time to come to himſelf
a little, and his Wit, as the Son
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41286:13"/>
breaking out from under ſome
Clouds, taking new Forces, did
flouriſh ſo many ſeveral ways, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that ſmall Eclipſe, that they
were as much charmed to hear
him ſpeak, as they had been aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
to ſee him fight. He gave
his hand to the Princeſs to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
her to her Apartment, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the conſiderable Perſons of
that <hi>Court,</hi> having follow'd them,
were raviſhed to conſider him
more nearly. The Marqueſs came
afterwards; and ſeeing him ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
in with all thoſe fine
people, he thought, armed as he
was, that a longer entertainment
might incommode him; and that
it would do him a kindneſs, to
diſingage him. It is in a Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
My Lord, ſaid he to him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gallantly, and as a Gentleman
at the Bed-ſide, that the Ladies
would ſee you. You will there
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41286:13"/>
find perhaps more dangerous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
than in the Liſts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you had beſt prepare your
ſelf for it. It is true, My Lord,
anſwered the Count of <hi>Saluces,</hi>
thoſe Enemies are to be feared
you ſpeak of; but ſince there is
no honour to reſiſt them, one
may find a Comfort in being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.
After theſe Words,
which he expreſſed with a very
paſſionate action, he took leave
of the Princeſs and retired. The
Marqueſs offered him an Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his Palace, which he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy
refuſed; for that he well
knew that they daily expected
there the Queen of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who were
two perſons of a Rank to leave
little place left.</p>
            <p>In the Evening there was a
Ball; and the <hi>Count de Saluces,</hi>
Who would not let ſlip ſo fair an
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41286:14"/>
occaſion of ſeeing the Princeſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
who had charmed him,
prepared to appear there one of
the neateſt. He ſucceeded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to a Wonder; for beſides that
he was naturally ſo in his Perſon,
all that he had, and all that he
put on, had an Air gallant and
ſuitable. He came then to the
Ball, where he was expected with
much impatience, for all the
World had a deſire to ſee if he
had as good a meen in his
Cloaths, as in his Armour. There
was a noiſe through all the Hall
at the ſame time he appeared,
that the Ball was ſomething In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted:
They preſſed one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
ſome to ſee him, ſome
to make him place, and made a
ſort of Confuſion very agreeable
for him. He was dreſſed after the
<hi>French</hi> way, which is a Nation
which gives Modes to all others,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41286:14"/>
and that Dreſs perfectly well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
him: But it was neither
the Richneſs, nor the Novelty of
the Trimming which moſt drew
the Eyes of the People; it was
the Grace and the Air of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which Charmed the Hearts
of thoſe who looked upon him.
Never was Man better made
than he; he danced, and it was
with that he quite Surprized
thoſe who had not yet been won
with the Qualities that had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
been taken notice of in
him; for it was impoſſible to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
ones ſelf better. The Ladies,
and eſpecially thoſe who had the
Reputation of Beauties, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to Conqueſts, formed in
admiring him a thouſand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
upon his Liberty, but it
was the Affair of <hi>Briſcida;</hi> and a
Fear reſerv'd for her Charms.
He was ſo much Tranſported
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41286:15"/>
with the Pleaſure of ſeeing her,
that he was hardly himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> who had
not yet appeared at the Ball, came
there a little after him, in Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade,
accompanied with ſome
Perſons of the Court, who like
him ſparkled with the Gold and
Jewels they had upon their
Cloaths. This Count no ſooner
ſaw <hi>Gaſpard de Saluces,</hi> than
that he conceived a cruel <hi>Jealouſie,</hi>
which with the vexation he had
already had, of being conquered
by him, in the ſight of <hi>Briſcida,</hi>
finiſhed the rendring him one of
his moſt Mortal Enemies. He
had a Fierce and Impetuous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
incapable of Suffering any
thing that was above him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
from thoſe he eſteemed his
Inferiours; Reſtleſs, Suſpicious,
troubling himſelf with all things,
and in his actions more paſſionate
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41286:15"/>
than any Man: Otherwiſe, as I
have already ſaid, well made of
his Perſon, and brave to very
raſhneſs. He quickly perceived
the change there was for him in
the Minds of the Ladies, that all
was turned for the <hi>Count de Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and that that New Comer
would have the better of him in
all things, and in effect it was
yet more true than he believed it.
No body was took notice of but
<hi>Gaſpard de Saluces;</hi> and they all
diſputed who ſhould do him the
moſt Honour.</p>
            <p>Theſe were cruel blows to the
<hi>Count Palatine,</hi> to whom they had
already rendred the like Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancies;
and who had flattered
himſelf that any other than he
could not merit ſo much. The
Maſque he had very convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken, helped him to hide the
effects that Sight produced in his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41286:16"/>
jealous Mind; and not deſiring
to be long the Witneſs of the
Glory of his Rival, he went from
the Ball, leaving for ſome time
the reſt of the Company much
in pain, who knew not what was
become of him.</p>
            <p>The Ball ended; and if there
had been a Prize to have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
without doubt the <hi>Count</hi>
of <hi>Saluces</hi> would have won that
of Dancing, as well as that of
the Turnament. He went away
loaded with the Prayſes of thoſe
who could give them, and who
knew how to give them. The
Princeſs was one of the firſt who
rendred him that juſtice; and ſhe
looked upon him ſo obligingly in
ſeeing him depart, that that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
favour did much help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his paſſing, with more
Tranquiliry, the reſt of that
Night, than he would have done.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41286:16"/>
It is true, that it was not to be
expected that he could paſs it
without diſquiet, being full, as
he was, of the Idea of <hi>Briſeida,</hi>
which however he would not
have drove away for the moſt
agreeable Sleep of the World;
at leaſt, if it had not repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her to him in all his Dreams.</p>
            <p>It is thus that Love is uſed
to inſinuate it ſelf into hearts. It
begins by a Flame of Joy, which
ſpreads it ſelf through all the Bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy,
and with which a Lover i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ſo Enchanted, that he believe
there is no greater felicity in Life
than that of Loving. Thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſes
however give too much
Pleaſure to laſt long, with a Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo violent, and which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
without trouble. <hi>Gaſpard
de Saluces</hi> had too clear a Wit to
be long dazzeled with ſuch Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
and coming by little and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41286:17"/>
little to make Reflection upon
what his Hopes were founded,
ſo much joy he had felt in his
Soul, to have ſeen <hi>Briſcida,</hi> he
perceived his Errour, and that
he had no reaſon to rejoice; and
as if he had from thence fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
a part of the Misfortunes,
which were to happen to him
from that fatal ſight, he could
not retain ſome Tears, which fell
from his Eyes, and which made
him take the Reſolution, of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
a budding Paſſion, which
could not but render him very
Unhappy. But it was not an
Affair ſo eaſy as he imagined, to
efface the Image of <hi>Briſcida</hi> in a
Heart, where it had already took
Impreſſion.</p>
            <p>What can I pretend, <hi>ſaid he in
himſelf,</hi> from the Ardour I find
my ſelf tranſported with? What
can I hope from a Princeſs, to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41286:17"/>
whom ſo many other Princes, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than I, pretend? Who Love
her, who Serve her; and who
have not yet been able to obtain
any thing from their Services, no
more than from their Love? Though
I ſhould be, <hi>continued he,</hi> more
happy than they have been, what
proportion is there between the
State of my Father, and that of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> that ſhould make me
be preferred before ſo many Rivals?
and what appearance is there that
a Princeſs, Severe and Ambitious,
who regards no body, ſhould dain to
caſt her Eyes upon me? No, no,
my Heart, thou muſt undeceive
thy ſelf, though thou wer't made
for <hi>Briſcida,</hi> ſhe was not made for
thee; and it is in vain that—<hi>He
could not make an end. His
heart gave the Lie to all he had
juſt thought, and he thus Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
What is Love ſo terrible, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41286:18"/>
it muſt be ſhunned with ſo much
Weakneſs? <hi>Thou ſayeſt that</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeida
<hi>is above thy hopes, that
thou canſt not pretend any thing
from her after ſo many other
Princes;</hi> well then, content thy ſelf
with loving the moſt Amiable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in the World. How many is
there of thoſe who are above thee,
who are reduced to the ſame neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity?
She can be but one Mans,
and there will be ſtill Unhappy ones
enough to comfort thee for the
ſame loſs.</p>
            <p>This was the diſcourſe of a
paſſionate heart, that argued not
very right. Love is only nouriſhed
with hopes; and this only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Loving is not capable to
content a paſſion ſo full of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.
He would have comforted
himſelf with the Misfortunes of
others; but it is in Love that this
happens, where all is regulated
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41286:18"/>
only according to ones ſelf; where
one would be always the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.
The <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Saluces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who
was not ignorant of one of theſe
Truths, although he had never
yet been in Love, concluded from
thence that he loved but weakly,
ſince his heart gave him Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
ſo little ſuitable to Love. I
ſhould be likewiſe ſurprized, ſaid
he, after a little Reflection, that
having always been ſo difficult to
engage my ſelf, I ſhould have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
my ſelf at the firſt ſight of
<hi>Briſeida.</hi> Am not I at <hi>Caſſal</hi> the
ſame that I was in all the Courts
I have been? and of ſo many fair
Ladies I have ſeen, has there
been one that has made me ſigh,
but as much as I pleaſed? I ought
to know my ſelf better, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he, ſtill deceiving himſelf
more, and not to take Sentiments
of Eſteem, which are perhaps
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41286:19"/>
ſomething extraordinary, becauſe
the Object is ſo, for Sentiments
of Love.</p>
            <p>How different is a Lover from
what he was wont to be, when
he knows not himſelf how he is
Embaraſſed in the middle of all
thoſe Winds which Fear and
Deſire raiſe? He argues accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the one or the other of
thoſe two Paſſions repreſents it
ſelf to his Imagination: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is Deſire that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
and ſometimes it is Fear.
He takes their Counſel by turns:
he Reſolves, he Wills, he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
he Advances, he Retires,
he Takes, he Leaves; In fine, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more Deſigns, and never leſs
Execution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gaſpard de Saluces,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been thus almoſt all the
Night, agitated with all theſe
different Tempeſts, ſeeing the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41286:19"/>
Day come, would riſe to go ſeek
ſome ſolitary place where he
might diſſipate them. <hi>Caſſal</hi> is
in the beſt Situation of the
World, for places proper for
Amorous Penſiveneſs. There
is all round it a thouſand agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Walks, whether along the
<hi>Po,</hi> which waſhes it's Walls, or
in the Fields, which are the fineſt
that can be ſeen. But nothing
is ſo Charming as the <hi>Park,</hi> which
beſides ſeveral Natural Beauties,
has a Thouſand Adomments of a
vaſt Expence that the Marqueſs
has made there, there are Green
Arbours, Grotto's, Terraces,
Walks, Fountains, and in fine
all manner of Ornaments, which
certainly render it one of the
fineſt Parks in the World. The
<hi>Count</hi> in going from his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſſed by Chance before
the Gate of that Park, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41286:20"/>
it open, without knowing
what it was, the conveniency
more than any thing elſe, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to enter, and walk there.
He went from Alley to Alley
without ſtopping, nor almoſt
taking notice of the Beauty of
the place, ſo poſſeſſed was he
with his Ideas; and he came at
length to a Circle of Trees,
which was one of the fineſt
things in the place, and where
all the great Allys met and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It is not without trouble
one gets in: Becauſe there is no
Door but what is compoſed of
a double Row of Trees, whoſe
Bodies are interlaced with thoſe
kind of Shrubs which ſerve for
Natural Walls. There is ſeen
in the middle of this Circle a
Fountain, out of which there
comes many Water Spouts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which Sprinkle the Borders; and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41286:20"/>
all round ſeveral Green Arbors,
where you hardly ſee day. There
was only this place that was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of making our new Lover
ſomething recollect himſelf from
his profound penſiveneſs; and it
was in one of thoſe Arbours that
he would go and ſigh, without
other Witneſs than Darkneſs and
Silence. He was followed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Idea of <hi>Briſeida,</hi>
which ſo poſſeſſed his Mind, that
overcome with the thoughts he
had upon this Subject, as much
as with the ill Night he had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
he fell aſleep upon a Graſs
Couch, where he had ſeated
himſelf. A little Repoſe was
without doubt a great comfort to
him, if in all that time his mind
had not been diſquieted with a
thouſand troubleſome Dreams,
which denounced him as many
Misfortunes. It ſeemed to him, in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41286:21"/>
in fine, that he ſaw the Princeſs,
who reached to him her hand,
to draw him from a Precipice,
where he thought to have been
loſt, and told him with a clear
and intelligible Voice, You pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to my Heart, Count; I
conſent to it; you ſhall have it,
but it will coſt thee thy Life. She
had hardly pronounced theſe
words, when he ſaw the place
where he was converted into a
Sea of Blood, from which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
in vain, as they do in
Dreams, to get out; and ſwet
with Labour. Thereupon he
awaked, all afrighted with the
Circumſtances of this Dream, of
which he had ſtill ſo ſtrong an
Idea, that he ſeemed to ſee <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcida,</hi>
that Precipice and that
Blood after the ſame manner it
had been repreſented to his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
He would immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41286:21"/>
quit the place, that in making
him ſee the moſt amiable Princeſs
of the World, inſpired him with
ſo terrible Viſions; but he was
hardly at the Door, than that
<hi>Briſcida</hi> preſented her ſelf to his
ſight, only followed by one of
her Women, and in an Undreſs,
who walked in the ſpace that
there is between thoſe Arbours
and the Fountain. A rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo unforeſeen, with what he
had juſt Dreamt, put him into a
perfect Confuſion. He remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as in an Extaſie, without
Speech, without Action, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt Motion, his Eyes
fixed upon that Charming Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
but in a poſture, which
with the trouble and the change
there was upon his Face, would
have made one believe that he
was going to expire. <hi>Briſcida</hi>
appeared no leſs ſurprized than
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41286:22"/>
he; and was ſome time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing what Reſolution
ſhe ſhould take; but the Rules
of her Devoir, from which ſhe
was not uſed to ſwerve in the
leaſt, having made her know to
what ſhe expoſed her ſelf, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
her to return, after having
ſaluted the Prince; who as if his
Senſes recovered his firſt Forces,
by the Degrees ſhe went from
him; Ah Deſtiny! cryed he, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Eyes and Hands to
Heaven, ſince you have thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
it, I defend my ſelf no
longer, I will die for the Love of
her. Theſe Words were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
with ſo much of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport,
and with a Voice ſo high,
that the Princeſs who was not
yet got out of the Circle of the
Trees, heard them, and could
not hinder her ſelf from turning
her Head towards him: And ſhe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41286:22"/>
ſaw him in the Poſture I have
juſt told. That Action was not
remarqued by the Count, from
which he might have drawn fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Conjectures for himſelf;
but the conſent he had juſt given
his Heart to abandon himſelf
wholly to the Love of <hi>Briſeida,</hi>
made his Mind a little more
calm; and he returned home,
leſs burdened with Grief than he
went out.</p>
            <p>He only employed himſelf all
the reſt of that Day, in thinking
of the happineſs of that Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
He knew not if it was the
Princeſſes Cuſtome, or Hazard,
that had made him meet her
there; but be it as it would, he ſtill
rejoiced at it as a piece of good
Luck, and conſidered her Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
as that of the Sun, which was
come to diſſipate all thoſe ſad
Clouds, with which thoſe Horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41286:23"/>
Dreams had obſcured his
Mind. Not but that, as the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of Lovers have their
Turns and Returns, he found he
had Committed ſome Faults,
which vexed him, as having let
the Princeſs go away, without
ſpeaking to her, not to have been
the firſt to have ceded the place,
to have Interrupted her Solitude;
and in fine a thouſand other the
like Subjects, of which he Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
himſelf, as of great Crimes.
Lovers are thus Ingenious to
trouble themſelves ſometimes.
Yet when he came to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon the manner ſhe
had beheld him, it ſeemed to him,
that it was with an Air favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enough; and that her Eyes
had nothing of a diſpleaſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
As in effect he had reaſon;
and if he had not been ſtrongly
poſſeſſed at her firſt Appearance;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41286:23"/>
and that he could have judged
with his uſual Penetration, he
would have ſeen all that he could
hope of the moſt happy Preſages
for his Love, for it is certain that
that aimable Princeſs, having not
been able to be the Miſtreſs of her
ſelf in that Occaſion, almoſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to be ſeen, all that there
was in her Mind of Trouble,
Emotion of Joy and of Fear, and
a hundred other different Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which that ſight excited in
her Soul; and which made her
change Colour two or three
times; ſhe had already paſſed a
very cruel Night, full of Sighs
and of Tears, that the Combats,
Reflections and Reproaches had
torn from her Heart. All this
coſts dear to a Soul, that never
knew what was diſorder of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
nay nor diſquiet of Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:41286:24"/>
The firſt time ſhe had ſeen the
<hi>Count de Saluces,</hi> ſhe found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo great and ſo particular in
him, that ſhe took an extream
pleaſure to conſider him from one
end to the other. Afterwards
the Combat he had againſt the
<hi>Count Palatin,</hi> the Victory he had
gained over him, the Pleaſure he
had therein done her; All theſe
things, I ſay, ſo Glorious, and ſo
Favourable for him, had made
ſome Impreſſion upon her, or at
leaſt formed Admirable Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to a particular eſteem,
which were quite Eſtabliſhed the
Evening he came to the Ball.
Sentiments ſo new produced too
extraordinary Effects in her mind,
for her to be long time without
perceiving them; but far from
ſtriving againſt them, ſhe would
Authoriſe them by reaſon. What,
ſaid ſhe in her ſelf, if there be a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41286:24"/>
Man who is above all others by his
Merit, can one hinder ones ſelf
from having ſomething more for
him? Do not I ſee, that all the
conſiderable Perſons that are
here, follow that Maxime, that
they all Commend him, they all
Court him, they all Honour
him, and treat him after a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
manner from all others? But
her Mind, which was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſuffer it ſelf to be long abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with ſuch weak Enticements,
taking Forces from her Reaſon,
which ſtill held firm; What is it
that I do, replied ſhe a moment
after, with contrary Sentiments?
I give him Arms to conquer me.
Is it thus that one ſtrives againſt
a Paſſion that would render it
ſelf Miſtreſs of my Soul? And
thou, my Severity, what's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of thee? Thou baſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoneſt
me; but no, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41286:25"/>
ſhe after a Moment of Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
what can I fear? I have
perhaps an eſteem for that Prince,
but which will never come to
Love. I am not a Fool: And
all his Merit as great as it is, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
blind me to that point, as to
make me forget what I am,
and what is my Duty. If I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him Juſtice, I ſhall render it
likewiſe to my ſelf. There is
ſome difference between the
<hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Saluces</hi> and the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi>
of <hi>Montferrat;</hi> and my
Heart, which hardly conſiders
thoſe who are it's Equals, will
not eaſily ſtoop to him, whom it
ſees below it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briſcida</hi> deceived her ſelf, Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities
do nothing in Love. A
Heart mounts or deſcends, as it
pleaſes that Paſſion, and it is not
often known which will have
the better. There needs only
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41286:25"/>
ſometimes one ſimple Charm, or
nothing, to ſerve it for Weight.
But it was, that that ſevere
<hi>Princeſs,</hi> (ſeeing her ſelf hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
whether ſhe would or no,
whither her Inclination drew
her) would have hid her Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
from her ſelf, not to be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to reſiſt him.</p>
            <p>A certain Joy ſeiz'd her as ſoon
as ſhe ſaw him come to the Ball,
mingled with I know not what
fear, that ſhe would not that any
other but her had felt the like; and
ſhe in ſome manner trembled at
the Marks of Eſteem the other
Ladies gave him, and as if ſhe
was already affraid of loſing him.
But that which moſt lively touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, and which made her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think,
her ſelf, was the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſhe felt when the Ball was
ended, and that ſhe ſaw him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Point of Retiring. She
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41286:26"/>
then feared the Sequel, quitted
the Company, leſt the change
there was in her Mind, might
be diſcovered by her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ſhe came to her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
ſhe retired into her
Cabinet, where a number of
Sobs, of Sighs, and of Tears,
overwhelmed her at the ſame
time. She asked her ſelf the
reaſon, without being able to
find it, and was ſo much the more
afrighted, that ſhe began to learn
the cuſtom of theſe tender Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Her Woman, who knew
not what ſhe did thus long alone,
and who ſaw that her Hour of
going to Bed was long paſſed,
went and knocked at the Door of
her Cabinet, to ask her, if ſhe
would not be Undreſt; that noiſe
made her Recollect her ſelf a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
to think of the Condition
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41286:26"/>
ſhe was in, and not being willing
to appear before them in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
ſhe was there ſtill ſome
Moments before ſhe went out,
endeavouring to ſettle her ſelf,
and told them at her return to her
Chamber, that ſhe was not well.
They put her to Bed, where ſhe
hoped to have at leaſt the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of thinking and labouring to
cure her ſelf of a Diſeaſe, which
already preſſed her ſo much, as
to make her afraid of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.
But herein, ſhe decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her ſelf; for Night, Solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Thinking, are not
good Remedies for ſuch a Paſſion.
Never ſo many ſorts of Diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
as aſſailed her in her Bed. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of that Character ſuffer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
in ſuch like Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:41286:27"/>
               <hi>Briſeida</hi> had never been in
Love: She knew nothing more
of Love than what ſhe had
read in Books: But it is eaſy to
become knowing in it, when
one is once engaged. I had beſt
imagine, ſaid ſhe to her ſelf, that
it is nothing but Eſteem, what I
feel for the <hi>Count de Saluces:</hi> I
have eſteemed ſeveral People in
my Life, but never after this
manner, and my Heart proceeds
too far: from whence ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the trouble that the ſight of
him alone gives me? Why al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
thinking of him? And
theſe Sighs and theſe Tears that I
find ſtealing from my Heart, what
do they not tell me! Ah! It
would perfect my ruine to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it from me any longer. Thou
Loveſt, baſe Heart! Thou that
didſt ſo highly value thy ſelf for
being inſenſible! Thereupon ſhe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41286:27"/>
reproached her ſelf, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to call back into her Mind
all that was moſt capable to turn
her from the Precipice ſhe ſaw
her ſelf led to: but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for all her Efforts did only
diſcover more clearly to her her
Weakneſs, and the more engage
her.</p>
            <p>Love makes more way in ſuch
great Souls, than in thoſe that
are weak, becauſe it makes uſe of
all, and neglects nothing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
them entirely. Day came
at length, after ſo terrible a Night;
and not being able to ſtay in Bed,
where far from getting reſt, ſhe
was aſſailed by ſo many different
Pains, ſhe roſe to go and take a
little Air, and try to ſoften her ill
Inſolitude. She called <hi>Doriſa,</hi>
one of her Women, in whom ſhe
moſt confided, and bid her dreſs
her. <hi>Doriſa,</hi> much ſurprized at
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41286:28"/>
this Deſign, anſwered it was yet
very early; and that there was no
Body up in her Apartment; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that this did not change her
Reſolution, ſhe did what ſhe was
Commanded, and gave her the
Cloaths ſhe would have; and
without any other Attendance,
they both deſcended the Balcony
that had ſtairs into the Garden,
and from thence they went to the
Park, which was a Place more
Retired, where the Princeſs, who
at that Hour would not be ſeen
by any body, had a Mind to walk.
<hi>Doriſa</hi> followed her, much in
pain, to know what Diſeaſe the
Princeſs had, who was not uſed
to do thus at the other times ſhe
was indiſpoſed. This, I ſay, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed
her; and ſhe would
gladly have been able to have
penetrated into the ſecret; for to
have imagined that her Diſeaſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41286:28"/>
lay in the Heart, and that there
was Love in this Change of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
ſhe knew her too well to
dare only to conceive the leaſt
ſuſpicion. Nevertheleſs it was
that. It was Love which having
made <hi>Briſeida</hi> loſe her reſt, led
her to the Park, and Conducted
her to the ſame place, where was
the <hi>Count de Saluces.</hi> But with
what Aſtoniſhment was ſhe ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
when ſhe ſaw him come out
of the Arbour. But a Moment
before, ſhe had ſaid to her ſelf,
My God, what would become of
me, if I ſhould now meet him; and
ſhe no ſooner ſaw him, than that
ſhe believed Heaven concerned it
ſelf in it, and that it would be to
no purpoſe for her to defend her
ſelf.</p>
            <p>She was ſome time without
knowing effectively, what was
become of her ſelf, and if then,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41286:29"/>
as I have already ſaid, <hi>Gaſpard de
Saluces</hi> had had the Liberty of
his Sences, and that he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
her, he would have ſeen
in her Face and in her Action
the moſt ſenſible Marks he could
have hoped of his Happineſs.
For in the firſt Moment ſhe ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her ſelf to be tranſported
with the Pleaſure ſo charming
a ſurprize gave her: And ſhe was
hardly come to her ſelf, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
what ſhe was, and
what Modeſty required, ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
her ſelf from a place ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to her.</p>
            <p>But at the Exclamation this
Prince made, ſhe could hardly
reſtrain her ſelf from ſtopping
and anſwering him. That Day
was leſs cruel to both Parties,
than the Night.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:41286:29"/>
The <hi>Count</hi> deſpaired of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and the <hi>Princeſs</hi> content
with having comprehended by
his Words, as well as by his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he Loved her paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
was much delighted, and it
eaſed the pain that her Reaſon
gave her of the too advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sentiments which ſhe had
for that Prince.</p>
            <p>In the Evening the Marquiſs
had advice by an Expreſs Couri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that the Queen of <hi>Sicily</hi> was
but fifteen Miles from <hi>Cazal,</hi> and
that ſhe hoped to make her En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
the Day following. All the
Forreign Princes and Lords who
were in that Court prepared
themſelves to accompany the
Marquiſs <hi>de Montferrat,</hi> who
was to go meet that Illuſtrious
Queen. They had all great and
Magnificent Equipages, which
they yet endeavoured to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41286:30"/>
in that Occaſion, where
there was only required Pomp
and Show.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Count de Saluces</hi> who had
been at <hi>Cazal</hi> but one day, with
a Train of a Knight Errant, was
the only one of whom nothing
extraordinary could be expected;
and yet, in the little time he
had, it may be ſaid, that he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed,
not only all Expectation,
but all that a greater <hi>Prince</hi> than
he could have done in ſeveral
Days. It is true, that it was not
ſo much to do Honour to the
Queen, as to pleaſe the <hi>Princeſs;</hi>
and as he had the fineſt Meen of
any Man in the World, there was
no body made ſuch a ſhow as he.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marguerite</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Wife of
<hi>Lewis de Anjou</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi>
of <hi>Naples,</hi> &amp;c. Being to go to the
King her husband, who had
newly took poſſeſſion of thoſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41286:30"/>
Kingdoms, deſigned in leaving
<hi>Provence,</hi> where ſhe retired,
to ſee her Brother, Duke <hi>Lewis</hi>
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with whom ſhe was
to Confer about Affairs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence;
and <hi>Cazal</hi> was choſen
for the place of their Interview.
Not but that he would have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
had a place leſs out of his
Siſters way, or ſome City in his
own State; but ſhe had thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
it for Reaſons, of which the
moſt Important was, ſhe had a
deſire to ſee <hi>Briſcida,</hi> of whom
ſhe had heard ſo much talk. That
Queen pretended much to Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and ſhe had already a long
time deſired with an Extream
paſſion, to have ſome pretext to
ſatisfy her Curioſity, that ſhe
might her ſelf judge, if all that
was ſaid of that fair Princeſs was
true.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:41286:31"/>
Women do not uſually do one
another too much Juſtice upon
that Chapter, and are the firſt
who are deceived in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
themſelves. This Queen
was certainly one of the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Beauties; and there was
none but <hi>Briſeida</hi> who could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with her the firſt place. She
had after her a great Train of
People; and 'tis to be imagined
her Equipage was ſomething ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Magnificent, ſhe being to
make therewith her firſt entry
into thoſe two Kingdoms; and
haughty as ſhe was, ſhe had forgot
nothing for the making it the
moſt Glorious.</p>
            <p>The Marquiſs had no ſooner
met her with all thoſe <hi>Princes,</hi>
than that ſhe alighted out of the
Coach where ſhe was, more
to ſhew her ſelf, than for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon of Ceremony; and ſhe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41286:31"/>
mounted upon a fine Barb, which
ſhe managed with the beſt Grace
imaginable: She had upon her
Head a Coronet in form of a Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
covered with Diamonds, and
ſhaded with a number of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which had upon her a
moſt Charming Effect: All peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were raviſhed to ſee her;
and thoſe who had fancied there
was only <hi>Briſeida</hi> in the World,
were ready to unſay it, and
knew not who had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
She, for her part, was no
leſs charmed, to ſee with the
Marquis ſo many young hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Lords, with Equipages
and Trains ſo rich, ſo neat, and
ſo pompous: She eaſily judged
that they were perſons of the
firſt rank, the moſt part of
whom were invited to <hi>Cazal</hi> by
the Beauty of <hi>Briſeida:</hi> She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
them all, the one after
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41286:32"/>
the other, and asked their Names
of the Marqueſs. <hi>Gaſpard de
Saluces</hi> was one of thoſe, who
was the leaſt ſet off with Gold
and Jewels; yet whoſe Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
immediately drew the
Eyes of the Queen, and of whom
ſhe firſt informed her ſelf; ſhe
took notice that he was extream
thoughtful; but his diſcourſe
appeared not leſs agreeable.</p>
            <p>When ſhe was about two
hundred paces from the City,
<hi>Briſeida</hi> met her, with all the
Principal Ladies of the Court
ſplendidly dreſt: That interview
was fine, and had ſomething
very ſingular between two ſuch
Beauties as they were; for they
cauſed admiration in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and without doubt jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
There was a Triumphant
Chariot prepared for the Queen,
which had followed <hi>Briſeida.</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41286:32"/>
They both mounted into it, and
enter'd the City with the ſound
of an infinite number of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
and a terrible noiſe of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.
But <hi>Gaſpard de Saluces</hi>
had neither Eyes, nor Ears, ſince
he ſaw <hi>Briſeida;</hi> and though the
Queen looked on him, and ſpoke
to him, his anſwers were not like
what they had been, and had
his Eyes ſtill fixed upon that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Princeſs.</p>
            <p>She came at length to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
where ſhe was regalled with
a noble Collation, after which
the Maqueſs conducted her to
the Apartment he had prepared
for her, being the neateſt and
richeſt that ever had been there.
One part of the Night paſſed in
Ceremonies and Compliments
uſual in ſuch occaſions, after
which all retired to leave the
Queen in the liberty to go
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41286:33"/>
to Bed. All people confeſſed
ſhe was one of the Faireſt, and
one of the moſt amiable Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that was under the Heavens;
but there was none ſo well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
as the Marqueſs <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat;</hi>
and though in an age
ſomething advanced, Gallant as
he was, his heart was not impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable
to ſuch fair Charmes.
The Count <hi>Palatin,</hi> in whoſe
mind Ambition would have
rais'd a revolt, did likewiſe agree
to this truth. That engaging
ſweetneſs he found in the Queen,
and which he called the true
Charm of Souls, was in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
capable of cauſing greater
perfidies than he meditated. <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeidia</hi>
was a haughty Princeſs,
that treated with a coldneſs that
proceeded to contempt. She had
not favoured him with one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
look in two months he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41286:33"/>
had ſerved her, and ſighed for her;
and he ſaw that a Queen full of
Charmes, and of whom the
Conqueſt would be the moſt
glorious in the world, honoured
him at the firſt ſight with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
goodneſſes; Vanity at leaſt
made him think ſo.</p>
            <p>It is after this manner that
theſe proud Minds treat Love:
They appear in the beginning all
full of ardour; but it is a fire
which goes out at the lure of
another that that paſſion which
rules them counſels them to
follow, in the hopes of a better
Succeſs. The Marquiſs and
this Count found themſelves
poſſeſſed with eſteem for the
Queen of <hi>Sicily;</hi> but with an
eſteem, which in ſo little time
had advanced too far, not to
be quickly converted into Love.
Thus eſteem ordinarily goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41286:34"/>
or rather Love masks it
ſelf with the Figure of eſteem,
the better to ſeduce us. The
fair Queen likewiſe on her ſide
felt ſomething new in her,
which ſhe knew not how to
name; and which hindred her
from ſleeping: It was neither
for the love of the Marqueſs,
nor for the love of the <hi>Palatin,</hi>
ſhe hardly thought of them. So
much honour ſhe had received,
ſo much pomp, ſo much magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
that had been made for
her, in ſome manner contented
her proud mind; but in the
heart, ſhe felt I know not what,
which troubled all the joy ſo
glorious a day ought to have
given her. <hi>Briſeida,</hi> and the
Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi> were as two
Stars, which in entring <hi>Cazal,</hi>
foretold her a thouſand Cruel
pains ſhe was to ſuffer there.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41286:34"/>
The Beauty of that Princeſs,
which ſhe found yet more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
than ſhe could have imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
gave her troubles ſhe had
never tryed for any Woman;
and ſo many Charming qualities
ſhe had obſerved in that young
Prince, terribly allarmed her
Heart, which ſhe feared to loſe
and to loſe to no purpoſe, near
ſo fair a Princeſs. She had brought
with her <hi>Julia,</hi> Daughter of
Count <hi>Palamedes.</hi> Who ſhe
tenderly loved, and who lay or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
with her. That Maid
heard her often ſigh and turn
inceſſantly in the bed; yet durſt
not ask her what ſhe ailed; but
at length the diſquiet ſhe had get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the better of her Moderation:
<hi>I know not, Madam</hi> (ſays ſhe
to her) <hi>whats the matter, but
either you are not well, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vexes you, that is not to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41286:35"/>
come to my knowledge.</hi> The
Queen only anſwered her at firſt
with a great ſigh. She wiſht,
without doubt, that <hi>Julia</hi> would
divine her Diſeaſe, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
her to declare it: But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſelf preſſed more than
once, and having all manner of
Confidence in her, ſhe could
not conceal from her any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that ſhe had her mind ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
embaraſſed. <hi>Have you well
conſiderd,</hi> Julia, (ſaid ſhe to her)
<hi>the Princeſs of</hi> Montferrat? <hi>How
do you find her? Is ſhe not the
handſomeſt Perſon upon the Earth?
It is true, Madam,</hi> (anſwered
<hi>Julia,</hi> ſomething ſurpriz'd at
that Queſtion) <hi>that ſhe appeared
to me pretty, as in effect ſhe is:
But I ſhall do her Beauty no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
if I ſay, that I know as
perfect, and which, without lying,
is much more Charming: For
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41286:35"/>
you know, Madam, that to be
pretty, and to pleaſe, are two
things; and that one may poſſeſs
the one, and want the other;
and that misfortune is happened
to the Princeſs of</hi> Montferrat;
<hi>who being otherwiſe a perfect Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
has not, at leaſt in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that which moſt touches Peoples
hearts, which are particular
Charms, which often have the
better of the greateſt Beauty.</hi>
Would to God, <hi>Julia,</hi> ſaid the
Queen to her, embracing her
very tenderly, as being pleaſed
with what ſhe had juſt ſaid, that
all the World were as thou art.
I confeſs, Madam, replyed <hi>Julia,</hi>
that the Princeſs would not
touch me: But ſhould ſhe be to
the Eyes of all others wholly
different to what ſhe is to mine,
and to ſay more than is poſſible
to ſay, that ſhe had as many
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41286:36"/>
Charms as you have, that Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Beauty does it at this
preſent give you ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
that you loſe your reſt; and
though that Princeſs were as fair
as you, ſhould not you be ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
her, one of the greateſt
Queens upon the Earth? I ask
your pardon, Madam, purſued
ſhe ſeeing the Queen gave her no
anſwer, if I dare tell you, that
this ſurprizes me from a Wit as
reaſonable as yours. If you knew
your ſelf well, you would judge
better of your ſelf; and would not
trouble your mind about an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which no body dare diſpute
you. I avow, anſwered her the
Queen, that I am extravagant, in
having ſo ridiculous a ſuſpicion:
But what will you do if I cannot
help it? Leave me as I am, or
ſay nothing to me: For I ſhould
fear to fall perhaps into a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41286:36"/>
worſe Eſtate than that in which
you ſee me. <hi>Julia</hi> replyed no
more, and kept ſilence ſome time.
She knew not what to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
from the ill humour of the
Queen, which was ſo unuſual.
She judged 'twas not the Beauty
alone of <hi>Briſeida,</hi> which cauſed
ſo great a change; though it
was a very nice point, for a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Woman: In ſo much, that
ſhe believed, and with Reaſon,
that there was ſomething
more in her Miſtreſſes mind,
which ſhe would have gladly
known. I will not, Madam,
ſaid ſhe to her ſome time after,
enter further into your ſecrets,
than you will permit me to dive;
but if I was ſuffered to tell you
what I think, I know you ſo
well, for the Queen of the
World, who gives the beſt
Judgment of things, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41286:37"/>
believe, that it is only the
Beauty of <hi>Briſeida,</hi> that has ſo
poſſeſſed you for theſe two or
three hours, that you do nothing
but ſigh: Give me only the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to queſtion your ſighs, they
will tell me perhaps the Truth of
a diſeaſe you endeavour to
diſguiſe. I heard thoſe ſighs,
continued ſhe ſmiling; and if I
underſtand them, they were
not ſighs of Envy. <hi>Julia</hi> was not
deceived; and that which made
her ſpeak thus boldly, was, that
ſhe knew the fair Queens heart,
which was not the moſt inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the world: As ſhe had an
infinite deal of Wit, ſhe had well
foreſeen, that of ſo many hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
young Princes there was
in that Court, there might be
ſome one who better pleas'd
her Miſtreſs than the others.
The Queen could not deny it in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41286:37"/>
the end: But ſhe at the ſame
time aſſured her, it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but pure eſteem, and not
the leaſt ſentiment of Love. So
pure an eſteem, replyed the
cunning <hi>Julia,</hi> would make me
ſigh, Madam, as you do. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
replyed the Queen, bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little, that there is ſome
tenderneſs mingled; but do you
believe that one cannot have
tenderneſs without having Love?
That is true, Madam, replyed
<hi>Julia,</hi> who had no mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
her therein; but that is
very nice. After that ſhe preſſed
her no more, well imagining,
that the Queen, who could not
ſleep, would not fail to renew
the diſcourſe, to tell her her ſelf
all ſhe deſired to know.</p>
            <p>How loth ſoever a Woman
is to make an amorous Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it muſt be allowed, it is a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41286:38"/>
very great eaſe to the Heart,
when one can find a Perſon in
whom to put Confidence, and
who is capable of ſuch kind of
ſecrets: One is ſo full of theſe
beginnings of Love, that there
is no greater pleaſure, than to
diſcharge ones ſelf a little, upon
ſome one who knows how to uſe
Compliance. The Queen
ſigh'd more than ever, to the
end <hi>Julia</hi> might return to the
aſſault. That Maid knew it; and
ſaw very well what ſhe would
have. But either out of malice
or revenge ſhe would not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
her; at length however, as
out of pity, ſhe renewed. Well!
Madam, ſaid ſhe to her, you will
not grant that it is Love. Alas!
the Queen anſwered ſighing,
it ſhall be all that you will. Why
then, ſaid <hi>Julia,</hi> do you make
ſo great a myſtery of it to me?
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41286:38"/>
Do you eſteem me, or rather
do you love me ſo little, that
I muſt needs force this ſecret from
you? Do not wonder, <hi>Julia,</hi>
replyed the Queen; I would not
know it my ſelf. Do you believe
it ſo eaſie to confeſs ones weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
that there's no need of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſſed to it? It is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to have ſo much pride, as
I have: And I know no body
but thy ſelf, to whom I would,
though it were to ſave my Life,
make the like Declaration.
<hi>Julia</hi> heard her; but was not of
thoſe falſe pretenders to diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
who to mend their own
Reputation, would have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to have given her an ill
diſcription of Love. She was
too clear ſighted, not to ſee that
the Queen failed in her Conduct.
But ſhe was neither old enough,
nor of a humour to make remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41286:39"/>
to her; which beſides
would have been very uſeleſs,
as all thoſe are, that are made to
Lovers: What ſhe deſired, was to
know the name of that happy
Conquerour: She fell to talk
of all the Princes and principal
Lords of that Court, to praiſe
the merit and good meen of
each one in particular, to begin
from the Marqueſs down to thoſe
who made the leaſt of Figure
proper for a Lover: But the
Queen did not ſeem to be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the leaſt ſentiment of
eſteem for any of thoſe ſhe had
named: Malicious <hi>Julia</hi> had
cunningly and deſignedly forgot
the Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi> of whom
ſhe had more ſuſpicion than of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other; not only becauſe that
Prince was made after a manner
that it was hard for any ſenſible
Woman to ſee him, without
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41286:39"/>
having for him advantageous
ſentiments; ſhe had likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
that the Queen had
with her Eyes examined him
more than once with a great
deal of pleaſure; ſhe was not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
and what ſhe expected
hapned, for the Queen impatient,
that after all ſhe had ſaid to the
advantage of the one and the
other, ſhe ſpoke not of him
whom ſhe thought above all; but
thou, ſaid ſhe to her, who are ſo
knowing in Beauty and the good
meen of people, from whence
comes it, that you tell me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Son of the Marqueſs
of <hi>Saluces:</hi> Is it, continued ſhe,
with a little bluſh which flew
into her face, that you have not
obſerved, that there was not
one of thoſe you have named,
who had ſo good an Air, nor
was ſo well made, as he, and if
thou haſt heard part of thoſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41286:40"/>
things, he ſaid to me from the
beginning, prithee tell me, if one
can have more wit than he has.
That is true, Madam, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Julia</hi> ſmiling, but I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
you ſhould ſay that your
ſelf, hoping you would acquit
your ſelf better than I. Ah!
<hi>Julia,</hi> cryed ſhe, I knew what you
would ſay, thou haſte diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all; I care not, I have told
you too much not to let you
know the whole. You muſt not,
replyed <hi>Julia,</hi> make an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to me of what coſts me all
my Addreſs: For you ſee, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I know nothing from you
but what I am fain to divine.
What will you do, replyed the
Queen, laughing? It is not but
that I had a deſire to declare to
you all; but as I have already
ſaid, When one is proud and
pretends to glory, one has a great
deal of pain to bring any thing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41286:40"/>
to light, that accuſes us of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
If you knew the pleaſure
you did me in ſparing me a part,
you would not take it ill that I
make you languiſh after ſuch a
ſecret. A man as the Count <hi>de
Saluces,</hi> ſaid <hi>Julia,</hi> has me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
wherewith to juſtify a
Woman, for having ſome incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for him: For it is certain
he is quite differently made from
others; and I believe it very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
when one has ſome little
weakneſs for Gentlemen of his
faſhion. But I find it no leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
to be able to keep to the
ſentiments of eſteem you ſpeak
of, when one is ſo well perſuaded
of the merrit of a man, in whom
there is found ſo many qualities,
which ſerve for excuſe and for
pretext, to paſs further and to
proceed to Love. The Queen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
her, that however ſhe
promiſed her ſelf it, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41286:41"/>
that Prince, as ſhe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
him, ſhe had made for
him all the paces ſhe could make,
and that there would be nothing
more. I now know, continued ſhe,
that there are men of a certain
Character, who have a ſtrange
Authority over the minds of
Women: For in fine, to have
made me ſigh from the firſt time
I ſaw him, is what I never would
have believed, though he had
come from Heaven. I ſaid how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
not long ſince, out of I
know not what Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that if for my misfortune I
ſhould ever meet a man, as I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
him, made juſt as the
Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi> all my Spirit
could not hinder me from having
a kindneſs for him. What fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<hi>Julia,</hi> and how we
are made each one to have his
weakneſs: However, added ſhe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41286:41"/>
ſeeing ſhe was not interrupted,
I will ſee I am faulty in not faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in not defending my ſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than I do. For in fine, what
will all this come to? If I love,
am I ſure of being beloved? The
Count of <hi>Saluces</hi> came not to
<hi>Cazal</hi> for the love of me, and it
will not be for me that he will
ſtay there. He knows not the
ſentiments I have for him, nor
ſhall he know them if I can help
it as long as I live: What delight
can I expect from this whimſey,
and how unfortunate ſhould I be
if I ſhould further engage my
heart, and that his ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
be poſſeſſed by <hi>Briſeida.</hi>
It is true, I have been told, he
has been but four days in this
Court. But I have ſeen him ſo
penſive, that I fear I am come
too late by four days, or too ſoon,
to have any thing but trouble.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41286:42"/>
This, <hi>Julia,</hi> this is all my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet;
and if thou comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
it well, thou wilt find, that
it is the greateſt, with which a
nice Soul, as mine, can be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt.
Help me, if thou loveſt
me, my dear <hi>Julia,</hi> to get light
into this affair: Let us obſerve
both the one and the other, for I
ſhall not be at reſt, till I am well
aſſured what there is in it. <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeida,</hi>
perhaps will not diſtruſt
me, and that we may diſcover
this miſtery, I will ſeem to have
ſo much Confidence in her, that
ſhe ſhall be forced to put ſome in
me; and ſhe will tell me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, the ſentiments ſhe
has for that Prince.</p>
            <p>Thus the Amorous Queen paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Night with <hi>Julia;</hi> ſhe was
not ſo much to be pitied as <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeida:</hi>
A heart which can ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
render it ſelf, is not ſenſible
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41286:42"/>
of half thoſe ills, that another
which defends it ſelf indures: She
permitted her ſelf all things;
nay, and took delight, fair as ſhe
was, in imagining that the
Count <hi>de Saluces</hi> was going to
be her Lover. But the Princeſs
of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> whoſe virtue a
little more ſevere, did not ſuffer
her to entertain her ſelf after the
Queens mode, had not the leaſt
ſweetneſs to comfort her for the
ills ſhe ſuffered; by ſo much the
more cruel, in that ſhe was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to conceal them; and yet
could not Conquer them; they
kept her Company Night and
Day, and left her not a moment
of repoſe. The Beauty of the
Queen of <hi>Sicily</hi> did ſtill produce
new troubles, which gave her
cruel allarms; and this in truth
was that which then moſt diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted
her. She would not have
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41286:43"/>
been in ſo much pain perhaps
without <hi>Gaſpard de Saluces.</hi> It
was for the love of him, above
all, that ſhe had a deſire to
have the better of the Queen of
<hi>Sicily;</hi> and in that deſign, ſhe
was no ſooner up, than that ſhe
took a thouſand Cares, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the bad effect of the two
Nights ſhe had paſt ſo ill: But
whether ſhe found her ſelf not ſo
handſome as uſual, or that it
appeared to her thus out of the
great deſire ſhe had to be more
than ordinarily, ſhe could never
content her ſelf; and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to bed, under pretext of
ſome indiſpoſition, an excuſe
always ready for Ladies, when
they find not in themſelves Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
enough to appear in the
light. The Queen on her ſide
was buſied to the ſame end; and
to lay inevitable ſnares for the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41286:43"/>
Counts Heart. She conſulted
ſometimes her Glaſs, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Julia;</hi> and ſaw no body
enter her Chamber, of whom
ſhe did not ask, how they liked
her that day. She was dreſſed
like an Amazone, which was
then the mode, and the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
for her, as the moſt
dangerous to the Eyes of men;
and if ever Woman ſhewed
Beautys in that Habit, it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
that charming Queen.
The Marqueſs was the firſt who
came to make a mortal Eſſay;
and ſo many Charms, whoſe
power he was already but too
ſenſible of, brought him into
that confuſion that he had hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the force to ſpeak to the Queen
ſome diſordered words. She
to whom the like Triumphs of
her Beauty had already hapened,
did only ſmile; and being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41286:44"/>
to encourage the Marqueſs
by flattering him: It cannot be
ſaid, my Lord, ſaid ſhe to him after
a very obliging mannner, that you
are not very exact in doing the
honours of your Court; for
from the evening to the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
you forget nothing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
your Gueſts. Ah, Madam,
anſwered the Marqueſs ſighing,
if there was nothing, but what
you ſee, you would be but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
obliged; and I ſhould have
but little to do. The Queen,
who immediately comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by the paſſionate tone with
which he ſpoke, what he meant,
had no mind to make him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
for fear of engaging her
ſelf too far in a diſcourſe of which
ſhe would not underſtand the
leaſt. Not but that at another
time ſhe would have made it her
divertiſement to have a Gallant
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41286:44"/>
as the Marquis; but in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of a paſſion the leaſt
amuſement is a burden, and
does only help to incommode.
Wherefore ſhe fenced it off by
making him a thouſand queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon indifferent things,
till that the <hi>Palatine</hi> came, who
perplex'd her no leſs than the
Marqueſs, who was as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
as ſhe: For already ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on by his paſſion, and not
knowing when he ſhould find
ſo fair an occaſion of declaring
it, he could not help the being
vexed at the other for coming
ſo unluckily to incommode him.
But the <hi>Palatine,</hi> who had the
ſame deſign with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
was no leſs diſappointed
and out of humour, than he.
They both made ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments
to the Queen, who
ſuffered them with patience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41286:45"/>
yet would have been
glad to have been rid of them,
to the end the Count <hi>de Saluces</hi>
coming, as ſhe expected him,
ſhe might entertain him in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
that uneaſineſs made
her turn her Head every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
towards the Door, as any
one entred the Chamber; ſtill
hoping that it would be him.
At length, being overcome with
impatience, or rather ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Jealouſie ſeizing her;
being told the Princeſs was not
well, ſhe ſuſpected the Count
<hi>de Saluces</hi> might be with her;
without ground however, thoſe
liberties not being permitted in
thoſe Countries, eſpecially at the
hour ſhe fancyed. But of what
ſuſpicions is not an Amourous
mind ſuſceptible! in fine, ſhe
was not at reſt, till ſhe had
prayed the Marqueſs to lead her
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41286:45"/>
to his Daughters Chamber, to
learn from her the news of her
health.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briſeida</hi> ſaw her enter as a
Sun, that came to vie with her
in Beauty and in Brightneſs.
There paſt Compliments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them which laſted ſome
Moments; after which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
was general. At length
came <hi>Gaſpard de Saluces,</hi> who
immediately drew the Eyes of all
the Company: He had this in
particular and uſual to him, that
whereſoever he came he made
himſelf conſidered above all the
others. The Princeſs bluſht at
her firſt ſeeing him, and if the
Queen had took the pains to have
obſerved her then, as ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to do in all Occaſions, ſhe
would eaſily have diſcovered a
truth, which ſhe might have
read in the Princeſſes Face; but
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41286:46"/>
perhaps it was better for her ſhe
did not. It is true ſhe was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
her ſelf, with her own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
that ſhe had not time to
think of examining that of others.
It was ſhe whom <hi>Gaſpard de Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
firſt ſaw at his entrance into
the Chamber; and who ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amazed him with the Force of
her Charms, that he would have
been ſurprized without the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
of <hi>Briſeida.</hi> The Queen
obſerved it with a great deal of
Joy, but ſhe did not long enjoy
that pleaſure; becauſe he had no
ſooner turned his Eyes towards
the Princeſs, than ſhe ſaw her
Charms defeated. Ah cruel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
for ſo fair a Queen, who
had diſpiſed the Conqueſt of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Kings: She was vexed to
the very heart; yet ſhe had ſo
good Opinion of her ſelf, as not
to yield to any Other; and that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41286:46"/>
a Woman always flatters her
ſelf very eaſily in what concerns
her Beauty; ſhe returned to the
Charge; ſhe Ey'd him, ſigh'd at
the ſame time, ſhe caſt her Eyes
upon him, ſmil'd upon him,
ſpoke to him very obligingly:
So many advances ought to have
produced ſome effect, but it was
little or nothing. The regards
of that happy Lover paſt over
her as lightning, but fixt upon
<hi>Briſeida,</hi> and it was perceived
they were not removed from
thence without pain. Ah my
God, what vexation! She would
then, if ſhe had been able, have
caſt away all the advantageous
thoughts of him; but a heart
cannot eaſily retire, it muſt
march on with Love, and when
once you have made the firſt
ſtep, it ſeldom ſuffers you to look
back: She for ſome time kep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:41286:47"/>
ſilence, entertaining her ſelf with
the unhappy ſtate of her tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<hi>Heavens! What have I
done?</hi> (ſaid the poor Queen,) <hi>I
have given my Heart for nothing:
I have put it into the Hands of a
Man, who is poſſeſſed by another,
and what is moſt ſhameful for me,
is, that I am not able to take it
back: Yet perhaps I am deceived</hi>
(added ſhe a moment after) <hi>the
too much Paſſion we have for
things, makes us often miſtake;
and Love is always ingenious in
giving us trouble, the Art
knowing Hearts by the motions of
of the Face, is not the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in the World; and the moſt
able have been ſometimes therein
deceived.</hi> She had time to make
all theſe Reflections, although
ſhe was in Company; the
mind goes much faſter than
the Sences; and there being a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41286:47"/>
great many Perſons concerned
in the Converſation, it did not
languiſh for ſome moments of
thoughtfulneſs or abſence of
mind of the Queens. <hi>Ah Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!
it is but too true,</hi> renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhe ſometime after, <hi>having
ſurprized the mutual looks of the
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inceſs, and of the Count, What
do I here? I only ſerve for a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the happineſs of their
Hearts.</hi> Where upon ſhe roſe
of a ſudden, Saluting and taking
leave of the Princeſs, ſhe took
the pretext of going to Maſs;
but in truth it was to carry with
her the Count, to whom ſhe
gave her Hand to Conduct her,
while that the Marqueſs and the
Count <hi>Palatine</hi> were retired into
a Cabinet to diſcourſe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
about ſome affairs.
It was a cruel Honour to <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard
de Saluces,</hi> that the Queen
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41286:48"/>
did him, becauſe knowing how
to make uſe of occaſions better
than any man, he would not
have failed in that, to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
the Princeſs, whom he
would have found almoſt alone,
by the Queens Abſence. He
was however to diſſemble that
little diſpleaſure, by ſo much
the more ſenſible, that he left
behind him the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi>
whom he conſidered as the
moſt dangerous of all his Rivals.
<hi>Briſeida</hi> was as little pleas'd as
he with the Queen, whoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
beſides the jealouſie it
gave her, did not ſeem to her
according to the Rules; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was for the Marqueſs her
Father, to have rendred her that
devoir, whom ſhe might have
waited for a moment. But the
Impatient Queen had only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the only motions of her
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41286:48"/>
Heart, which at that time did
not permit her to regulate her
ſelf according to the forms of
the World.</p>
            <p>What good meen ſoever the
Count <hi>de Saluces</hi> put on, ſhe had
at firſt took notice, ſhe had made
him no Compliment in drawing
him from the Princeſs; I well
ſee, My Lord, ſaid ſhe to him
ſmiling, I do you a diskindneſs.
In what, Madam, anſwered her
the Count at the ſame time?
much ſurprized ſhe had divined
ſo rightly what he had in his
Soul: is it not, becauſe the Grace
you do me will make ſeveral
jealous, and procure me Envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
You do not eſteem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
enough, replyed ſhe, that
Grace, to fear it will have that
effect. The moſt Ambitious of
all men, replyed the Count,
would place it above all he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41286:49"/>
could deſire; and you would
have a very ill opinion of me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
if you ſhould believe—I
will believe, interrupted ſhe
him, all that you will but tell
me ſeriouſly, if it will make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for the pleaſure, I ſhould
have done you in leaving you
with the Princeſs. I ask your
Pardon, Madam, anſwered the
Count, with a confuſed Air,
if I ſay, I know not what you
mean. Ah! Count, replyed
ſhe ſighing, I perceive, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
farther than you would
have me; and that you do not
judge me capable of being in
that your Confident. You are
in the right, purſued ſhe, and I
aſſure you, I am leſs fit for that
with you, than with any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the World: The Rank
you hold in the World, Madam,
anſwered the Count, does not
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41286:49"/>
ſuffer any one ſoever to treat you
after that manner; but though
you were a perſon as others,
what Confidence could a man
make you, that has been here
but two days; and who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any other paſſion, than what
honour inſpires. There needs
ſo little time, replyed the Queen
with a languiſhing tone, to
change the affairs of a heart, that
I know people who came ſince
you to <hi>Cazal,</hi> and yet find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
perhaps worſe. And for
honour, continued ſhe, I am
certain it is of no force againſt
Love. <hi>Gaſpard de Saluces</hi> was
going to repartee to this, and
perhaps would have acquitted
himſelf but ill; but to his good
Fortune, the Marqueſs and the
Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> who had had
notice, that the Qeen was going
to Maſs, joyned her at the ſame
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41286:50"/>
time, and accompanied her to
the Palace-Chappel; where du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Devotion, <hi>Gaſpard de
Saluces</hi> did nothing but think of
what the Queen had ſaid to
him. He was extreamly ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;
and knew not after having
examined all the diſcourſe, what
intereſt the Queen ſhould take
in his Sentiments, to oblige her
to take the pains, as ſhe had
done, to diſcover them. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
there was more than cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
in it; but he was not
vain enough to believe, ſhe had
been thereto incited by any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of jealouſie, or by any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of Love.</p>
            <p>Thoſe people who have the
moſt merit, are uſually thoſe
who flatter themſelves the leaſt.
Not but that the Count was ſo
clear ſighted, as to obſerve that
the Queen treated him a little
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41286:50"/>
better than the others; that ſhe
conſidered him, that ſhe might
have ſome particular eſteem for
him, which managed with a
little care on his part, might one
day procure kindneſs; but it
was a perfidy he would not
think of; having no deſign to
take care, but only to merit the
eſteem of <hi>Briſeida:</hi> Yet as it
was ſomething very glorious,
the having ſome part in the
mind and in the favour of ſo
Great and of ſo Fair a Queen:
He could not hinder his mind
from being ſometimes poſſeſt
with thoſe thoughts. What
would there be in it contrary, ſaid
he then, to the Sentiments I owe
the Princeſs, if the Qeen of <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
had ſome little eſteem for me,
and I a great deal of reſpect for
her: She is a perſon above all
I can pretend to; My heart is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41286:51"/>
wholly <hi>Briſeida</hi>'s, and there is
no danger of the leaſt Treachery.
A more perfect Lover, or at
leaſt a Lover better inſtructed in
the Maxims of Love, (for he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
loved the Princeſs, as
much as one could love,) would
have been ſcrupulous, only to wiſh
that the Queen eſteemed him;
and would never have be thought
himſelf to render her greater
reſpects, than thoſe that were
due: But he was a Novice, who
fancied that to be all in Flames
for the object he loved, was all
he had to do.</p>
            <p>The Devotion ended: Yet
the Queen being ſtill accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by the Marqueſs and the
<hi>Palatine,</hi> ſhe was hindred from
renewing the diſcourſe ſhe had
begun with the Count <hi>de Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi>
They conducted her to her
Apartment, where Dinner was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41286:51"/>
brought up at the ſame time,
and ſerved after the moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
manner that is poſſible to
be imagined; and where all the
Principal Lords of that Court
dined with her; as ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired;
to the end there might
be the Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi> who
could not diſpenſe coming:
She was to paſs the After-noon
in ſeeing the Palace, which was
certainly a fine building; but of
all the Curioſities the Pictures
were of the greateſt value. The
Queen loved them much and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
them perfectly: And
therefore ſtayed a long time to
conſider them, and diſcourſed
of them with the Princes after a
very skillful manner, knowing
at the very firſt of whoſe hands
they were. The Marquis who
could give a better reaſon than
the others, as being better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41286:52"/>
than any body in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
all thoſe pieces, was he
who maintaining the chief of
the Converſation, and did not
fail, when he met with ſome
ſtroke of Love well repreſented,
to make of it a particular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
at which the Queen did
only laugh, as a Gallantry of old
time. From the Gallery of theſe
Pictures they went to the Garden
which the Queen was deſirous
likewiſe to ſee; and in truth it
very well deſerved the being ſeen
by ſo fair a Princeſs, for it was one
of the fineſt Gardens of <hi>Italy.</hi>
Thitherto the Converſation had
been General, and leſs with the
Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi> who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
penſive, than any body;
but in the Allyes and Grottos ſhe
ſaw, ſhe hoped Fortune would
furniſh her with occaſions of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
the diſcourſe ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41286:52"/>
with him in the morning:
But then came <hi>Briſeida,</hi> as if it
had been to traverſe that deſign.
She was juſt got out of her Bed,
and was glad, in keeping compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
with the Queen the reſt of the
day, to go walk with her: The
Queen received her with that
diſſembled joy, in which Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
excell; and judged ſhe
ſhould not have it in that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
all the pleaſure ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
her ſelf, or at leaſt it would
be attended with a great deal of
vexation. The Marquis, who
conducted the Troop, lead them
towards a Fountain, that was
in a very agreeable place; in
which he had choſen to feaſt the
Queen. He helped her to walk
on one ſide, and the Count <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi>
on the other; inſomuch
that the Princeſs fell to the
Count <hi>de Saluces</hi> ſhare, who did
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41286:53"/>
not receive that honour withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
trembling, though with the
greateſt joy imaginable. She
was in an Undreſs, as a perſon
who was ſomething indiſpoſed;
but great and true Beauties ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
appear better than in their
naturals, and when they borrow
nothing from art; they are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
which the <hi>Italian</hi>'s call Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices,</p>
            <q>Le ſue negligence ſono le ſue
Artifici.</q>
            <p>There was ſeen in the perſon
of the Queen a Love all glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with pomp, filled with
Flames and Darts, with which
he fir'd and wounded all thoſe
that durſt regard him; and in
<hi>Briſeida</hi> a tender infant which
toucht, but after a delicate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and the poyſon was by ſo
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41286:53"/>
much the more dangerous, in that
it ſeem'd ſweet and innocent;
and that it was not miſtruſted:
Not but in that negligence, there
was found the Pomp and Majeſty
there is in the Infants of Kings.
But it was not this that had the
greateſt effect.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi> who
fancyed to have viewed <hi>Briſeida</hi>
in her greateſt Beauty the firſt
time he had ſeen her, was much
aſtoniſhed with the new Charms
of that day, nay his admiration
paſſed aſtoniſhment, and I am
not able to expreſs the Joy with
which he was tranſported. He
loſt his very ſight; and ſought
for himſelf, as a man that knew
not what was become of himſelf.
There are few people, who can
rightly comprehend theſe ſorts
of Extaſies, at leaſt without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been as much in Love as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41286:54"/>
the Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi> and with
a Beauty as that of <hi>Briſeida</hi>'s. He
was ſometime without ſpeaking
to her: She on her ſide, was
much the ſame, and all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
was made in looks,
more eloquent a thouſand times
and more perſuaſive than the
fineſt words imaginable. The
Queen, who walked before,
being uneaſie and jealous of what
paſſed behind her, between thoſe
two Lovers, gave very little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to all the two Princes
ſaid to her, who had the honour
to Conduct her. But it was to
no purpoſe ſhe liſtened, it was a
mute Language, into which ſhe
could not penetrate: She was
perceived to be in a continual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation
of mind, which made
her turn her head every moment
to obſerve them, and ſaid in
paſſing ſome words of raillery
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41286:54"/>
and of kindneſs to the Princeſs,
to engage without doubt the
Count <hi>de Saluces</hi> to anſwer her.
The <hi>Palatine</hi> little contented
with this procedure, would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have been angry if he had
durſt; and ſuffered extreamly in
the ill Figure he fancied he
made. But the Marqueſs, who
was a lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le more in love than he,
had likewiſe a little more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playſance
for the Queen.</p>
            <p>They came at length to that
Fountain, which was certainly
a wonder of Art. There was
ſeen a naked Man, who caſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from ſeveral parts of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and round him in a Baſin
there were Women, making ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
poſtures, in getting off
their Smocks. The entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was compoſed of Muſick,
of a Ballad, and of a Collation,
but all ſo gallantly and ſo well
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41286:55"/>
ordered, that the Queen high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commended the Marqueſs,
and would have been extreamly
ſatisfied with him, if he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
her a little more liberty than
he did, and have let her walk
all alone, or at leaſt with whom
ſhe pleaſed; for it was what ſhe
ſought; but he followed her over
all that Garden, with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
which fatigued her,
ſhe paſſionately deſiring to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with the Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi>
and not being able to do it, as I
have ſaid, by reaſon of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs,
ſhe would at leaſt hinder
the Princeſs from having that
pleaſure and advantage above
her, and went ſtill to interrupt
them as ſhe ſaw them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Palatin,</hi> who obſerved
by the Queens Face, that the
Marquis acted a troubleſome
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41286:55"/>
part, would not imitate him,
but amuſed himſelf in laughing
with <hi>Julia,</hi> believing it no time
loſt that was ſpent in gaining
that Maid, which might be a
means to come into the Queens
favour. That Charming Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
had an Air of Liberty and
Gayneſs, that procur'd Pardon,
for what would have been Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
in others. <hi>Italy,</hi> is a
Country of Formalities for the
actions which paſs in publick,
but the moſt diſſolute in the
World, for thoſe that paſs in
particular. The Queen, who
thought her ſelf above all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
talks, would not take the
trouble to conſtrain her ſelf; ſhe
talked, laugh'd, flattered, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
this, and ſometimes that,
and managed her ſelf not in the
leaſt: But above all, ſhe had a
deſign upon the Count <hi>de Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:41286:56"/>
with whom ſhe longed to
ſpeak in particular, if it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make the Princeſs jealous.
The inſeparable Marqueſs had
two or three times made her
loſe an occaſion; but at length,
a Labyrinth furniſhed her with
the moſt favourable one imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
It is true, that it was
requiſite to be a Woman, and a
Woman in Love, to find ſo good
an one without premeditation.
<hi>Come,</hi> ſaid ſhe, with a brisk Air,
<hi>there is a Labyrinth, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to me very proper for a Play
I have imagined; I will go hide
myſelf in it, and the firſt of you
three, ſpeaking to the three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who ſhall find me, I will
give him the Scarf I wear on my
Arm.</hi> Thereupon, without
ſtaying for their Anſwer, ſhe
ran to hide her ſelf in the Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
whither the Marqueſs
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41286:56"/>
followed her preſently after;
and bleſs'd a thouſand times
Love for a Play, which ſeemed
to him, to have been only inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to render him happy: For as
he had frequented the place,
he did not believe that that Scarf
could fall into any other hand
but his; and that he thus might,
the occaſion being ſo fair, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his paſſion to the Queen.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>Palatin,</hi> in whoſe
Heart, the inequalities of the
Queen had not wholly extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
the flame of his new paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
found his hopes revive at
the propoſal of that Play, in
which he hoped to make better
uſe than any body of the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
if he was ſo happy as to
gain the Scarf. The Count <hi>de
Saluces,</hi> who was only of the
Party, becauſe they engaged
him, was not very haſty to do
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41286:57"/>
as they did. He was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to diſpute with them that
prize, having before his Eyes,
all that he deſired in the world,
which he would not have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for a Scarf; nay, not for all
the Queens of the Earth. The
Princeſs made him ſeveral raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and told him two or three
times, laughing, that if he delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any longer, he would come
too late; not but that ſhe was
extreamly raviſhed with the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
earneſtneſs he ſeemed to
have; but ſhe thought her ſelf
obliged to make upon him that
little War; to which he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after a manner, that made
her know the little part he took
in that Play; and that he was
not of it, but becauſe he could
not excuſe himſelf from it.</p>
            <p>The Queen expected him
with the impatience of a Lover.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41286:57"/>
That Labyrinth was made after
a manner, that at each turn
there was an Arbour ſo covered
with boughs, that you could
hardly ſee any light. She ſtaid
in the firſt ſhe found, and had
already ſeen the Marquis and
the Count <hi>Palatin</hi> paſs by, who
run after her with an unparral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled
Ardour. The Count <hi>de
Saluces,</hi> whom ſhe infinitely
longed to ſee approach, came
not. That Prince walked with
a neglect, which ill anſwered
the Queens deſires. Muſt I, ſaid
ſhe, looking through the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
which compoſed that Arbour,
give my ſelf to day ſo much
pains to oblige a man who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes
his own Fortune, after a
manner ſo cruel and ſo ſhameful
to me. Ah Heavens! continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhe ſighing, I ſee what <hi>Briſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
coſts me: I left him with her
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41286:58"/>
and he cannot quit her; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I muſt go and reproach him.
But what a Fool am I, renewed
ſhe a moment after, I ſhould give
her wherewith to Laugh and
Triumph over me; and if I
can, I will only give her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and jealouſie. I hate her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
as my greateſt Enemy;
and I know not what I ſhould
do, if I was perſwaded he loved
her: He will not come—In
ſaying that, ſhe ſaw him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
but with an Action ſo
penſive and ſo indifferent, that
ſhe would then have rather choſe
that he had not come at all; and
ſhe begun ſeriouſly to repent of
all ſhe had done for him. Does
he deſerve, ſaid ſhe in conſidering
that negligent Air with which
he walked, not the heart which
I have but too much given him,
but the Scarf I prepare for him?
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41286:58"/>
Should not one ſay, that he
would give time to his Rivals to
carry it from him? How he
goes! Is it Love that guides
him? No, no, Cruel Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of the action of that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful!
fear nothing! You are
but too true; I will not ſuffer
my ſelf to be longer abuſed by
my too great paſſion: I perceive
that he has not the leaſt ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of tenderneſs for me; and
that he thinks of nothing but
<hi>Briſeida,</hi> whom he has left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his will.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding ſhe had all
theſe reaſons to be diſſatisfied
with the Prince, perceiving
he paſs'd without ſeeing her,
though ſhe had placed her ſelf at
the entrance of the Arbour,
where ſhe was yet ſhe could
not help calling of him. What
advances for a Queen, and a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41286:59"/>
heart muſt needs be ſtrangely
ſeiz'd by Love, to reſiſt ſo much
Confuſion. Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi>
ſaid ſhe to him bluſhing, Is it
thus you ſeek me? What do you
dream of? Ah, Madam, cryed
the Count, much aſtoniſhed to
ſee her, you ſurprize me; and
I did not think my ſelf ſo happy.
Yes very happy, without doubt,
replyed the Queen; but to
whom do you believe you owe
this happineſs? It is true, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Count, that it is not to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
at leaſt without I call thus
the Grace you do me; which
is certainly very great; and
your Goodneſs—Yes my
Goodneſs, interrupted ſhe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
one has a great deal for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that do not deſerve it. I
ſhould eaſily, anſwered the
Count, agree to what you ſay,
Madam, at leaſt in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41286:59"/>
me: If I was to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that goodneſs by my
Cares and by my Services, the
time having been ſo ſhort ſince I
had the honour to be known by
you; but if a great deſire of rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
you them by all the actions of
my life, joyned with the extream
reſpect I have already for you,
might be conſidered as merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
I ſhould not diſpair of one
day rendring my ſelf worthy. You
might hope ſooner, replyed the
Queen, in whom the Counts laſt
words had ſomething ſweetned
the bitterneſs of heart; ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are more able, continued ſhe,
than others; I know not of which
number you reckon your ſelf;
but I very well know that I have
done to day for you, what I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did for any body. Nothing
could be ſaid more obliging, and
words ſo advantagious from the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41286:60"/>
mouth of ſo fair a Queen ought
to make ſome impreſſion upon
the Spirit of the Count; but the
time was too ſhort, ſince he had
quitted <hi>Briſeida;</hi> yet his action
had ſomething ſo paſſionate,
ſince he was fallen in Love with
the Princeſs, that his leaſt word
ſeemed to be full of Love. Thus
the Queen who could not ſo well
penetrate into the bottom of his
Heart, entertained ſome hopes,
and was contented with this
tender out-ſide. How eaſy it is
to deceive our ſelves? when one
loves, one gives a favourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
to the leaſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
and one takes all for
kindneſs. That Charming
Queen contented with thoſe of
the Count, gave him her Scarf:
but after the moſt gallant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
poſſible, and would needs
tye it her ſelf on his Arm. The
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41286:60"/>
Marquis and the Count <hi>Palatin,</hi>
run at the noiſe there was made
in the Arbour, and came both
there almoſt at the ſame time,
and found the Queen tying the
Scarf on the happy Count <hi>de
Saluces.</hi> The Marquis could
not ſee the Fortune of his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
without conceiving a cruel
jealouſie; but the Count <hi>Palatin,</hi>
more malicious, and naturally
more miſtruſtful, immediately
gueſſed into the truth of the
adventure, extreamly vexed to
ſee that the Count <hi>de Saluces</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where triumphed over
him.</p>
            <p>The Queen was not at all confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
at their ſight, and preventing
what they might ſay; you ſee,
My Lords, ſaid ſhe to them, I am
true to my promiſe, and that it
is not to no purpoſe that one has
taken pains to ſeek me. We ſee
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41286:61"/>
it very well, Madam, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Palatin;</hi> and what is
more, that one needs not, when
you pleaſe, go very far to find
you. They are the uſual hits of
Fortune, replyed the Queen,
who quickly comprehended
what he meant: and if made us
buy what it gives us, we
ſhould be but little obliged to it
for its preſents. One attributes
ſometimes to Fortune, replyed
the Count, favours which do
not belong to it: Yet it is true,
continued he with ſomething of
ſweetneſs, that it would be
more eaſie to comfort ones ſelf
for having failed on that ſide,
than of the other which I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
The Queen who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
whither theſe words tended,
had no mind to anſwer him;
but turning towards the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41286:61"/>
whom ſhe ſaw penſive and
melancholly, ſhe gave him her
hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a ſmile, which was
ſome comfort to him in his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune;
and they went all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
out of that Labyrinth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briſeida</hi> amuſed her ſelf du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that time with gathering
Flowers in a plot, of which ſhe
made a Noſegay for the Count
<hi>de Saluces.</hi> It was a gallantry,
ſhe thought her ſelf indebted to
him, after the trouble he had
ſhewed to quit her to run after
another; which obligation ſhe
was reſolved to repay. But
what a vexation and what a
ſurprize was hers, to ſee him
return with the Queens Scarf!
She bluſhed, and her jealouſie
then excited ſo great a diſorder
in her Soul, that it almoſt ruin'd
all that Love had there advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
<hi>I am played upon,</hi> ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41286:62"/>
               <hi>the Traytor abuſes me by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and by his looks; he had
reaſon not to be in haſte; the
Queen had given him the Word;
and he very well knew where ſhe
was, otherwiſe he would not have
found her ſo ſoon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet to render Juſtice to the
Count, there was ſeen in his
Face, and by the air with
which he carried the Scarf, the
joy he had. The Princeſs not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all her anger, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
it; and to tell the truth,
that manner of indifference, too
viſible in the Count, was a
great ſuccour to her heart. But
the Queen, who had that time
prepared her ſelf to obſerve he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
had no ſooner ſeen her change
Colour, than that ſhe was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of her tender ſentiments for
that Prince; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
her as her declared Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41286:62"/>
ſhe took pleaſure in aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
her trouble. You ſee,
Madam, ſaid ſhe to her, with an
air of raillery, that the Count <hi>de
Saluces</hi> is a lucky man, he was
the laſt that run after me to ſeek
me; and yet is the moſt fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
That happens ſometimes,
the Princeſs anſwered her ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
but I know not from
whence it comes, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
not very proud of ſo fair a
Fortune; for he ſeems not to
have the more joy. The Queen
had remarked it as well as the
Princeſs, for the Love of whom
ſhe believed the Count affected
that Coldneſs. She would

me thereupon in particular, that
I willingly pardon him the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
he ſhews in publick. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
people, continued ſhe, are
uſed to do thus. It is to be
very much, replyed the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
and perhaps a little more
than ought. <hi>Briſeida</hi> in that
little diſpute ſhe had with
the Queen, doing the buſineſs
of the two amorous and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
Princes, they did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
her; nay they deſired that
the diſcourſe might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded;
but I believe neither
the one nor the other found plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in it, and therefore had no
deſire to purſue it.</p>
            <p>They went out of the Garden
in the ſame order they walked
thither; that is to ſay, the
Marquis and the Count <hi>Palatin</hi>
led the Queen, and <hi>Gaſpard de
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41286:63"/>
Saluces</hi> the Princeſs; this laſt
reſolving to make better uſe of
his happineſs, than he had done
in the beginning of the walk, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
ſeeing the occaſion was
going to eſcape him, asked the
Princeſs, for whom ſhe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
that fine Noſegay he ſaw
in her hands? It was for your
ſelf, anſwered ſhe him, if you
had been leſs happy than you
are. I am on the contrary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the Count, the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
of all men, not to have
merited it, ſince you deſigned it
me. Is it not enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> replyed

               </gap>?
It would be too great a fortune
in one day. That Fortune, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
replyed the Court, has
not been favourable to me, if in
giving me a Scarf, it deprives
me of a preſent which comes
from you, What! ſaid the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41286:64"/>
Princeſs, prefer ſome ſilly flowers
which wither in a day, before a
favour, as that, which comes
from the hand of a Queen;
Count, you are not ſincere. Or
rather, replyed he, I am not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
enough, to ſuffer my
ſelf to be tempted by the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a preſent; and if things
are only to be valued, as one
eſteems them; I am ſure I loſe
in this occaſion; and not to leave
any thing for you to gueſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
added the Count blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing,
I aſſure you, I would
have given a thouſand Scarfs,
ſuch as this, for one Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of that Noſegay. It is too
much, my Lord, ſaid the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to him, raviſhed with Joy
to hear him ſpeak after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and one would gain well by
you; if one would believe you;
But continued ſhe, giving him
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41286:64"/>
the Noſegay, one ought to be
as generous, as you are diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed;
and ſince you have ſo
much kindneſs for Flowers, I
will make you a preſent of
theſe.</p>
            <p>The Queen, who continually
turned her head on their ſide,
no ſooner ſaw the Noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay
paſs into the hands of the
Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi> but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
her ſelf on the Princeſs,
Well, Madam, ſaid ſhe to her,
had I not reaſon to ſay, that the
Count <hi>de Saluces</hi> is a lucky man
to day. I ſhould perhaps have
fancied ſo, Madam, anſwered
<hi>Briſeida,</hi> if I could have made
him as rich a preſent as yours:
But what paſſes in two or three
hours cannot make the fortune
of ſuch a man as he. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
begun a new diſpute, in which
the Marquis and Count <hi>Palatin</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:41286:65"/>
to oblige the Queen, were of
her ſide, and the Count <hi>de Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
who was obliged by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
if he had not been by Love,
to take the Princeſſes part, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it ſo agreeably and with ſo
much Wit, that they were the
ſtrongeſt. <hi>Julia,</hi> ſince the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
her Miſtreſs had taken
for that Prince, ſtudying him
in all his actions, was not put to
much trouble to remark that he
did not anſwer the tender ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhe had for him. She was
extreamly vexed, and would
have tore from him that heart,
he ſo unjuſtly poſſeſſed; Yet ſhe
reſolved not to ſay any thing to
the Queen, becauſe it would rather
proved mortal, than cure her. We
are never willing to be undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the errours of our hearts;
but ſhe deſigned to diſabuſe her by
little and little It was a return very
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41286:65"/>
difficult, and the Queen more
paſſionate than ever, for that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
man, would not ſo much
as ſuffer, her to ſpeak of him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it was to take his part Lovers
muſt be always flatter'd in what
they Love, otherwiſe they are
not pleaſed.</p>
            <p>The Charming Queen of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>
was deſirous on the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that <hi>Julia</hi> ſhould be ſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant
as to deceive her, as ſhe
deceived her ſelf; and that ſhe
might make her believe, that ſhe
was beloved by the Count <hi>de
Saluces</hi> as ſhe loved him, in the
recital ſhe made her of what
paſſed in the Labyrinth;
ſhe formed the moſt agreeable
adventure imaginable, and made
that Count ſay to her a thouſand
obliging things he had not
ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aſſurances and Oaths he
had not thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> motions of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41286:66"/>
Fear and Paſſion he had not had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
All which only rais'd <hi>Julia's</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſhe knowing the Contrary
of all the ſuſceptible Queen told
her, and that the Count might
have had a great deal of reſpect,
and that he might ſhew her as
much of eſteem, but that he
was not ſenſible of the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
for her. The day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there was a great Ball, and
the Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to perceive, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
and <hi>Palatin</hi> were jealous of
him, and in love with the Queen,
had a mind to divert himſelf to
their Coſts, and to vapour that
Evening with his fine Scarf. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
favour cauſed ſo many bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
as that: The Marquis was
not able to ſee the Count <hi>de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luces</hi>
without being jealous;
but his Daughter was much
more cruelly troubled. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41286:66"/>
that if the Count <hi>de Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
had ſo little valued that
Scarf, he would not have made
a ſhow with it that day. There
was only the <hi>Palatin</hi> who floting
between the inclination he had
for the Princeſs, and that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to have for the Queen, that
is to ſay loving nothing, was
not extreamly troubled, only his
preſumption gave him ſome vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
at the vanity of his Rival;
but having obſerved ſome alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the Eyes of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
he went to him and told
him in his Ear, that they had
been both foold by the Queen;
that ſhe had had a deſire to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Count <hi>de Saluces;</hi> and
that they had ſerved for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
to her giving him the Scarf.
If I could believe what you ſay,
anſwered the Marquis, in whoſe
Soul theſe words had deſtroyed,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41286:67"/>
the little reaſon there was left, I
believe the Gallant would not
long enjoy his good Fortune in
my ſight. Take the pains, purſued
the <hi>Palatin,</hi> to obſerve them, and
you will ſee the Intelligence there
is between them. Once more,
added he, ſeeing what he had
ſaid made him penſive, that Scarf
was deſtin'd before it was given,
and it was to much purpoſe we
run for it. The Marquis remained
ſome time without ſpeaking, and
I believe the Reflections he then
made, were cruel Reflections for
his heart. He already lov'd the
Queen more than one could love;
and he thought himſelf played
upon by a young man who appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
was his Rival. He was ready
to ſhew his jealous reſentment, but
he could not without bringing
upon himſelf all the trouble eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
with a Queen, who when
neceſſary knew how to make her
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41286:67"/>
ſelf conſidered as ſuch; and who
would have laught at him for it. In
fine, after many thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
which paſſed about this in
his mind, taking a reſolution, he
told the Count <hi>Palatin</hi> that he
would hear the Queen upon it,
and afterwards take ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
as were requiſite, and that
he was going to mask himſelf
to do it with the more liberty.</p>
            <p>The Count let him go, being
raviſhed in his Soul to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
an occaſion of breaking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his two Rivals, to have
the better ſhare on his ſide. With
the Ardour the Marquis went
from the Ball, he could not long
delay his Return to accompliſh
his deſign. He appeared dreſſed
after the Turkiſh Mode: His
Shape made him immediately be
known. He boarded the Queen,
who fell a laughing, and ask'd
him, what news from <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople?</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:41286:68"/>
That the choice, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
anſwered he ſoftly in her
Ear, you have made at <hi>Cazal</hi>
is ſomething unworthy of you,
and that the Count <hi>as Saluces</hi>
is all the care of the fair Queen
of <hi>Sicily.</hi> That anſwer check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and made her bluſh. What
is that news, replyed ſhe, after
ſome effort, gone already ſo far?
I had hoped, continued ſhe, to
have obliged the Marquis of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> in making uſe of
him in ſo agreeable a confidence;
but ſince it is no longer a ſecret,
I ſhall not conceal it from any
body: And to perfect the rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
ſhe called, without giving
him time to anſwer, the Count
<hi>de Saluces,</hi> who approaching:
Speak to that <hi>Turk,</hi> Count, ſaid
ſhe to him in quitting that
place, he has news to tell you,
which perhaps will ſurprize you,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41286:68"/>
and you will ſee that you are
not unhappy at <hi>Cazal.</hi> The
Count fell a laughing. He
knew not the buſineſs; but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
the Marquis, whom
he had diſcovered as the others;
Mask, ſaid he, if it be true what
I am juſt told, I ſhall be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged to you: For there is
no pleaſure in being happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing it. But the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
outraged to the very heart,
at the Queens manner of treating
him, retired without anſwering
him, and went to unmask.</p>
            <p>At his return he found the
Ball was ended, and that the
Queen was retired, as likwiſe
the Princeſs. He was ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
for it was not yet late, but
the <hi>Palatin</hi> came very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
to tell him the Reaſon.
Well, My Lord, ſaid the Count
to him laughing, what do you
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41286:69"/>
think? The Queen—Ah!
talk not to me of her, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
he, ſhe's the blindeſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
under the Heavens, and I
am the moſt unhappy of all men.
But tell me, continued he, how
comes it they are retired from
the Ball ſo ſoon? It was the
Queen, my Lord, anſwered the
<hi>Palatin;</hi> the cauſe of which you
know better than I. She was
the firſt that went away; and
not to diſguiſe any thing to you,
I fancy it was for the love of the
Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi> whom ſhe, I
do not ſay led but drew away
with her, becauſe in truth he
ſeem'd to go againſt his will; you
will find them ſtill together in her
Chamber. This was perfectly
mortal to the poor Marquis; he
ſigh'd two or three times out of
deſpair, he lifted up his Eyes to
Heaven, and of a ſudden quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41286:69"/>
the Count, he run to the
Queens Apartment.</p>
            <p>They may ſay what they will
of young people when they are
in love, they are no extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
like thoſe of an old man,
who pretends to an art which
paſſes his Age. That of loving
is only made for Youth, and when
Love engages thoſe grizled
Beards, he makes them act
parts which appear by ſo much
the more extraordinary in that
they act contrary to the Wiſdom
that is expected from them. The
Marquis was as different from
himſelf ſince his being in Love, as
he was before different from all
men. There was no more of
that moderation he had for
all things, that ſtaid and ſerious
Air, that ſmiling meen to all the
World; how Love changes peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple!
He was become penſive,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41286:70"/>
out of humour, melancholly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient,
having no joy, but
when he was with the Queen, ſo
prompt, ſo violent in all he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that it was difficult to ſerve
and content him. But to return to
the Queen, who finding her
ſelf offended with what that
Prince had ſaid to her, to render
the raillery the better on her ſide,
would be the firſt to make it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and turning towards the
Princeſs, who longed extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to know what paſs'd between
her and the Marquis her Father,
and why the Count <hi>de Saluces</hi>
had been called: By what I ſee,
Madam, ſaid ſhe to her aloud,
and laughing out of Contempt,
we are here in a Court, where
Conſequences are drawn from all
things; nay, and maliciouſly,
for having given yeſterday a
Scarf to the Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:41286:70"/>
they conſider me to day as his
Miſtreſs: And you, Madam,
added ſhe, who gave him a
Noſegay, will you be nothing
to him? It is not for me, Madam,
anſwered the Princeſs ſmiling,
to pretend any thing after you.
You quit him entirely to me
then, replyed the Queen? I have
ſo little part in him, ſaid <hi>Briſeida,</hi>
that I may with eaſe tell you
that I leave him to you entirely,
It is enough, replyed the Queen,
and turning towards the Count,
who might have heard all they
had ſaid upon his Chapter: You
are then wholly mine, ſaid ſhe
to him, at leaſt if you will not
give the lye to people very pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating,
and who believe they
certainly know it. Come, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſhe, without giving him
time to anſwer, bring me to my
Chamber, and there we will ſee
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41286:71"/>
to agree on the Conditions.</p>
            <p>All this raillery paſſed with ſo
free and ſo gay an Air, which
was particularly natural to that
Charming Princeſs, that there was
no body but believed it to be meer
Drollery. But the Count <hi>de Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
had like to have ſpoiled all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
at the ſame time he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to obey her, <hi>Briſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ida</hi> lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him after a manner that made
him know the Queens jeſting
did not pleaſe her, and rendered
him almoſt unmoveable, without
knowing what he ſhould do.
The Queen a little ſurprized in
that he ſtop'd, ſaw that he had
his Eyes fix'd upon the Princeſs,
and that it was that which retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him. What vexation! ſhe
trembled for fear the affront
would fall upon her; and uſing her
utmoſt effort, I find my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed,
my Lord, ſaid ſhe to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41286:71"/>
him bluſhing, take the pains to
Conduct me to my Chamber.
He had no way then to excuſe
himſelf. However the Princeſs
was diſpleaſed with him, and
retiring to her Apartment, ſhe
paſſed part of the night in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of him, and in crying, as
if there had happened to her
ſome great misfortune.</p>
            <p>The too happy Count had
hardly conducted the Queen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Chamber, when making
uſe of the ſame pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ext ſhe had
done, would have retired for fear
of incommoding her, ſince ſhe
found her ſelf ill. She fell a
laughing, which was enough to
make him comprehend the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of her illneſs; but <hi>Gaſpard
de Saluces</hi> not pretending to too
much underſtanding in that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
and having only <hi>Briſeida</hi>
in his Head, to whom he longed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41286:72"/>
to return purſued his firſt deſign;
when the Queen, out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
with a procedure ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallant,
told him bluſhing, that
her indiſpoſition was over, that
ſhe had ſomething to ſay to him,
and that ſhe would tell him
when it was time to retire. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that ſilence reign'd ſome time
between them, apparently both
much perplexed, but the Queen
was much more to be pitied,
and thoſe who can imagine what
a Woman ſuffers that loves, and
who has as much honour and
glory as a Queen, and yet finds
her ſelf reduced to that Eſtate,
would find it very difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
it well. She ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41286:72"/>
of me. As you are not, Madam,
anſwered the Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi>
to give an account to any body
of what you do, I cannot believe
there are people ſo bold as to
dare to cenſure you. May one,
replyed the Queen, rely thereon?
One may certainly, replyed he,
with a man who knows as
well as I do what we owe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
to ſo great a Queen as
you. It is true, ſaid ſhe, with
a man ſo indifferent as you are,
it is ill done to talk as one does.
Ah! for indifferent, Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Count, I can ſay
that I am not: But—No, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
the Queen, You are
only ſo for me; and I am ſure
one will never ſay of you, what
they ſay of the Queen of <hi>Sicily.</hi> She
bluſhed in finiſhing theſe words,
and for fear her diſorder ſhould be
obſerved by the Count, ſhe roſe,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41286:73"/>
and retiring into her Cabinet,
You may, continued ſhe, go:
I have ſaid enough, and perhaps
more than I ought to have ſaid.
What was now become of the
Count <hi>de Saluces</hi> Wit, at other
times ſo gallant and ſo proper
for all thing? it appeared in this
Conjuncture, when he had the
moſt occaſion for it, ſo new and
ſo childiſh, that it was hardly to
have been pardoned had it not
been for the love of <hi>Briſeida.</hi>
That innocent Hero obeyed the
Queen, who had no deſire he
ſhould obey her, and returned
to the Ball; where perfectly to
confound him, and to make him
deſperate, he found not the
Princeſs, who was the cauſe of
that ſad fault he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julia</hi> ſeeing him depart, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Chamber to know the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41286:73"/>
news of that little enterview.
She found the Queen in her
Cabinet lying upon a Couch;
Who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igh'd as ſoon as ſhe ſaw
her: Come, <hi>Julia,</hi> ſaid ſhe,
come comfort me for the choice
I have made of the pooreſt Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
that ever was in the World.
Wouldſt thou have ſaid it by his
meen? One muſt ſay all to him,
and likewiſe anſwer all for him.
My God! how innocent he is, I
fancy he has never been in Love.
Perhaps, Madam, anſwered the
Complaiſant <hi>Julia,</hi> reſpect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
him; and that he's affraid:
What is it thou ſayeſt, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Queen, that he's afraid?
Can the braveſt of all men want
heart, or at leaſt Wit, near a
pretty Woman? As they were
entertaining themſelves after
that manner, they ſaw the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
approach. The Queen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41286:74"/>
bid <hi>Julia</hi> hide her ſelf,
to be witneſs of their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becauſe after what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
at the Ball, it could not but
have ſomething very rare. The
Marquis, who at a diſtance had
ſeen <hi>Julia</hi>'s ſhaddow, and being
prepoſſed with what the Count
<hi>Palatin</hi> had juſt told him, fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it was <hi>Gaſpard de Saluces,</hi>
whoby reaſon of him hid himſelf;
and ſtopping at the Cabinet
Door; Apparently, Madam, ſaid
he to her with a diſordered Air,
you took no great pleaſure in
the Ball? No, without doubt,
my Lord, anſwered the Queen
very coldly, I there found my
ſelf incommoded, and came to
ſeek repoſe here. A man as I
am, replyed the Marquis, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
interrupt it. Any man
would at this time, replyed the
Queen, but being in your Houſe,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41286:74"/>
it is not for me to order any
thing. You are Queen, Madam,
and as much Miſtreſs in my
Houſe, as if you were in the
middle of your own Dominions:
Wherefore that Reaſon ought
not to make me excepted: But,
Madam, purſued he, the Civil
permiſſion you give me, does it
only regard you? I ſhould retire
without pain if I could perſuade
my ſelf that; but as it is to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
another, you will pardon
me, if you pleaſe, if you muſt tell
it me, more than once, if you will
be obeyed. The Queen did not
at firſt comprehend the ſence
of theſe words; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made Reflection that the
Marquis might have ſeen <hi>Julia,</hi>
and have took her for another:
She had a mind to make him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
to ſee which of the two
were deceived; and ſtill purſuing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41286:75"/>
the ſame point; My Lord, ſaid
ſhe to him, I know not what you
mean, but once more I find
my ſelf ill; you are a Prince Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
and diſcreet; and I muſt
confeſs a longer diſcourſe would
incommode me. It is then a
diſcourſe, replyed the jealous
Marquis, with a Prince gallant
and diſcreet, as I am; but not
with him who hid himſelf behind
your Couch at my arrival. The
Queen could not here hold from
laughing, which made him
quite deſperate, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what Countenance to hold
in the rage his jealouſie put him
in, he was going to retire, but
ſhe who had too much intereſt
to clear this myſtery, and to draw
him out of errour, prayed him
to ſtay, and not yet changing
the tone of her voice, is any one
hid here, ſaid ſhe, who is ſo
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41286:75"/>
dear to me, as you? tell who—Yes,
yes, Madam, interrupted
He, I have Eyes, and the Count
<hi>de Saluces</hi> is what you want,
for any other than him you are
incommoded. Here is more
news from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Queen: But do you
know, my Lord, purſued ſhe,
with an Air a little more ſerious,
that one is tired in the end, with
all theſe news? Thereupon ſhe
made <hi>Julia</hi> come out, and put
the poor Marquis into ſo great a
Confuſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all the diſobliging things
ſhe ſaid, to be revenged on him,
he had not one word to Anſwer.
It is true, he did not merrit to
be better treated, and his paſſion
had done him a very ill Service.
The Concluſion of all that affair
was, That the Queen being
tranſported with her Reſentment,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41286:76"/>
told him that ſhe would leave his
Country, and depart the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from <hi>Cazal;</hi> not pretending
to be come into a Court where
ſhe was to give an account of her
Conduct to any body, or to be
examined ſo ſtrictly. She only
pray'd him, for the Honour of
both, that all things might be in
order; to the end the cauſe of
her retreat might not be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and that her departure as
well as her Arrival, might be in
the Pomp, and with the Honours
that are requiſite.</p>
            <p>The unhappy Marquis retired
into his apartment, loaded with
all the poyſons that the like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
was capable of making a
man of his humour ſwallow, but
the moſt Cruel of all was the
Queens Reſolution, it was that
which was almoſt Fatal to him,
and drew from him Tears, which
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41286:76"/>
he had not ſhed in more than
thirty years. Yet when he came
to make Reflection on the Scarf
ſhe had given to the Count <hi>de
Saluces,</hi> and of the favourable
manner with which ſhe treated
him in the Eyes of all his Court,
he wanted little of being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
for this departure: Nay,
he almoſt deſired it. Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſaid he then, that ſo great and
ſo fair a Queen forgets her ſelf to
that point, that ſhe manages her
ſelf ſo little, that ſhe favours a
young Prince, who perhaps
goes only to her, becauſe ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
to him, and that on the
contrary, ſhe contemns thoſe
who eſteem her moſt, and for
whom it would be no ſtain to
her Glory to have all that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
It is thus, thoſe old Maſters
of the Art Dogmatize; and
thus it is they Condemn their
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41286:77"/>
Miſtreſſes, they look upon as Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
all that is not for them,
the Rule is only made for others.
At the Age the Marquis was of
he might give Leſſons; but thoſe
came from too ill a Principle;
and it was jealouſie inſpired him
with them: Yet they ſo well
fortified him in the deſign of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Queen depart, if ſhe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
reſolv'd on it, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the laſt thought he had, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having had all the Night a
thouſand of ſeveral faſhions, he
roſe, and in that Reſolution he
writ this Ticket to the Queen,
which he ſent to her by one of
his Gentlemen.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>I am the moſt unhappy of all
men, Madam, in having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
you; but more unhappy a
thouſand times ſince you will not
pardon me. You are reſolv'd to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41286:77"/>
depart, and to bring a Prince into
deſpair. I ſay nothing to you
thereupon; but ſince you take ſo
much pleaſure, in treating ſo cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe who love you, Madam,
you muſt be ſuffered to have your
will. The Gentleman who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
you this Letter is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your Commands, and you
have only to order whither you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to go.</p>

            <p>The Queen was but juſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
when they brought her
this Note. It was not very
much her deſign to depart: A
thouſand reaſons of heart, as
well as of the world oppoſed it.
She had not given a Rendeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz
to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> her
Brother, who was daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
to change ſo ſoon without
reaſons of Conſequence, it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41286:78"/>
would have cauſed reports; and
the <hi>Italians,</hi> who are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the moſt ſpeculative of the
World, and who reaſon upon all,
would have given divers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
to this departure. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that ſhe who wanted
neither Wit nor Judgment, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conſidered the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſuch a going away, had
no mind to it, though the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
ſeem'd to prompt her to it.
She eaſily gueſſed, that it was
the effect of an amorous vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which would laſt no longer
than ſhe was willing; and that
the leaſt of her looks would
change it into a very violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
She would however ſtill
diſſemble, and made anſwer to
that Gentleman, that within
three hours ſhe would be ready
to depart; and that in the mean
time the Marquis his Maſter
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41286:78"/>
might come to ſee her, to whom
ſhe would tell whither ſhe had a
deſign to go.</p>
            <p>As the motions of jealouſie
are the moſt violent, they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
paſs away the ſooneſt; and
repentances which always follow
them, come after, to torment a
poor Lover; but it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
too late that one repents.
The Marquis <hi>de Montferrat</hi> had
hardly ſent that Note to the
Queen, than that he would have
recalled his Gentleman to have
made another. He could not
wait, without trembling, for
the anſwer ſhe would make him;
and he accuſed himſelf of precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
which would coſt him his
Life. Lovers, in the Condition
this found himſelf, are thus ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to irreſolutions, which cauſe
them a thouſand pains. They
ſometimes deſire one thing, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41286:79"/>
then again another. Vexation
and Jealouſie inſpire Deſigns
into their minds, that Love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
with a return of kindneſs;
and yet it is Love which is the
Author of that jealouſie and of
that vexation. Thus one may
ſay, That it is he which does
and undoes the ſame thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he pleaſes, or that
he likes it. The mind which is
uſually more proud than Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
will ſometimes puſh its I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea
to the end, eſpecially when
it concerns Glory; but the
Heart more tender than the
Mind, having more inclination
for Love than for Noiſe, will
not always follow it, and it is
from thence thoſe Combats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe,
they have ſo often toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>At length the Gentleman
came, and rendered an account
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41286:79"/>
to his Prince of the Commiſſion
he had given him, and of the
Queens deſire. What the Queen,
cryed the frighted Marquis, is
then reſolved to depart; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſtaying any longer to make
uſeleſs queſtions, he ran to the
Queens Apartment, where fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon his Knees by her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
in which ſhe ſtill was, He
begged of her, after ſo tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a manner, that ſhe would
yet ſtay ſome days in his Court,
that ſhe believed, that he was
downright in Love with her;
which made her pity him. She
was a very good natur'd Princeſs,
and who never knew how to
hate any Body. She pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him: The Peace was made, in
Confirmation of which ſhe gave
him her hand to kiſs, which he
took with an unparallelled Joy,
ſo Charmed with that favour,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41286:80"/>
that he could not expreſs his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
but by tranſports.</p>
            <p>In the mean time as all that
preparation of Coaches and
Horſes had made a noiſe at the
Court, and that every Body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to know, for whom it
was; the Queen, not to give
occaſion to the talkers of News
to reaſon thereupon, thought
good, it being a fine day, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it in Hunting: Inſomuch,
that the Marquis went to give
Orders for what was yet neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<hi>Julia,</hi> who went halfs in
in all that hapned of good or ill
to her Miſtreſs, had quickly
her part of the laſt Scene which
paſſed with the Marquis, of which
the Queen made her a pleaſant
Hiſtory. After that ſhe would
prepare her ſelf for hunting;
but ſhe confeſſed to <hi>Julia,</hi> as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
as the Count <hi>de Saluces</hi> was,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41286:80"/>
ſhe ſhould have but little
diverſion if he was not there,
as it was to be feared; becauſe
apparently the Marquis would
not take care to give him notice.
<hi>Julia</hi> took upon her ſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him to be of the Party.
One does a great many things to
pleaſe a Miſtreſs one loves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly.</p>
            <p>The poor Count had not reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the night. That Noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay
of Flowers he had received
from the Princeſs, had not filled
him with ſo much joy, as the
regards ſhe had glanced on him,
when he conducted the Queen to
her Chamber, had frozen his Soul
with fear; and as he had hoped
to ſettle all right by a quick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
he was ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in not finding her ſtill at the
Ball. He retired to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mortally afflicted; and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41286:81"/>
himſelf upon the Bed, he
paſſed the Night without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
himſelf to be undreſt,
having <hi>Briſeida</hi> always before his
Eyes; and likewiſe ſometimes
the Queen. He could no longer
doubt of the eſteem the Queen
had for him: So many goodneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
had ſhown it enough to him;
and as it was not for a young
man as he to be cruel to a Perſon
of that Rank, and of that Beauty,
he was in a deadly Confuſion,
when he thought of the manner
ſo ungallant, with which he went
from her that Evening. What
will ſhe ſay of me, ſaid he to
himſelf; for whom ſhall I paſs?
Will ſhe excuſe me for the love
of <hi>Briſeida?</hi> No, no, I do not
merrit ſhe ſhould have ſo much
indulgence for me; and I believe
ſhe now hates me, as much as ſhe
before eſteemed me; is this bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41286:81"/>
She made it apparent that
ſhe had no mind I ſhould quit
her, and I have done ill in doing
it; though ſhe had commanded
me. I ought to have followed
her into her Cabinet, there to
have entertained her ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and have done what at

               </gap> that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Queen: Muſt the Love I
have for <hi>Briſeida</hi> render me the
moſt ridiculous of all men? As it
will render me perhaps the moſt
unhappy. Ah too lovely Princeſs,
cryed he thereupon, in making
a ſtop by a kind of reflection,
why cannot you love me, as I
love you, or why cannot I love
elſewhere, as perhaps I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved?</p>
            <p>With what paſſion ſoever a
heart is engaged, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41286:82"/>
moments wherein one
takes pleaſure to think one is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved;
eſpecially when it is by
ſome Subject that deſerves think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on, as was the Queen of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
and if once a certain vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereon gets the upperhand
of us, it is very difficult to be
quit of it. It is almoſt as ſtrong
as an inclination, and cauſes as
great effects. The Count <hi>de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luces</hi>
was wholly <hi>Briſeida</hi>'s.
There was not in his Soul the
leaſt deſign of infidelity; but as
one is not always Maſter of ones
thoughts; he could not keep
himſelf from ſome ſmall return,
when he thought of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſances
ſo fair a Queen had
for him; and if that is called
perfidy, it muſt be allowed me,
that it is of thoſe that the leaſt
repentance may procure to be
pardoned; and which never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41286:82"/>
Death. It extreamly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
him, that no body
ſhould perceive the paſſion he
had for the Princeſs, which
the Marquis, who begun to have
but little kindneſs for him, would
without doubt have oppoſed, not
only becauſe of the inequality of
Parties; but becauſe other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
pretended to it, who were
much above him. Inſomuch
that that reaſon and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more, obliging him to
keep his love ſecret, he thought
that an amuſement with the
Queen, ſince ſhe already offered
it, might be of great uſe to him.
But it was an affair very nice,
and to which <hi>Briſeida</hi> apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would not have agreed. The
Queen of <hi>Sicily</hi> was not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
made after a manner to
ſerve purely for a pretext, and
the Miſtreſs who had truſted to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41286:83"/>
it, would have been abuſed
without doubt: It was not a
propoſition to be made to a
Maid of wit as <hi>Briſeida.</hi> It is
true that the Count was not yet
come to that, he had hardly
made her know by his actions
and by his looks that he loved
her. But in <hi>Italy,</hi> where they
have not ſo many means of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
themſelves as in other
places, all ſpeaks; and looks make
more way than in any place of
the World <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

they have need to explain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

<hi>Gaſpard de Saluces</hi> paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
longed to come to that, to
be able afterwards to act in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert
with the Princeſs, and to
make uſe of the Queen, as ſhe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41286:83"/>
ſhould judge it convenient. The
beginnings of eſteem he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
received from the Princeſs,
flattered him with ſome ſucceſs;
and fortifying himſelf thereupon
the reſt of the Night, by many
amorous reaſons; for it is eaſie
to peſuade ones ſelf what one
deſires; he got up in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the deſign of ſeeking an
occaſion to ſee her, and ſpeak to
her; when this Letter was
brought him.</p>
            <p>More Care is taken of you than
you merrit; perhaps if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
it, one ſhould not be put
to ſo much trouble. But with ſuch
as you nothing is of Conſequence.
All are going to hunt, prepare
your ſelf to be of the Party, for it
is deſired you be there; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
troubling your Head to divine
from whom theſe Notices can come,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41286:84"/>
content your ſelf with knowing
that it is from one of the moſt
lovely Perſons of the World, who
would have a great deal of eſteem
for you, if you knew better how
to value ſuch an eſteem as
hers.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Julia</hi> who writ to him
this Letter upon the Queens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
He read it again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
ſeveral times; he ſent for
him, who had brought it, who
was a Footman without Livery,
to know to whom he belonged;
but ſeeing that his pains were
uſeleſs, he did not preſs him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more; but made this anſwer
to that Ticket.</p>
            <p>I know not whether I have
much merited the honour, or the
reproaches that are made me;
but I am full of Confuſion; and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41286:84"/>
there are but very few things I
would not do, to repair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one
and to render my ſelf worthy of the
other. It is not to be doubted but
that I will be of that party; and if
there be means to juſtifie my ſelf,
of what I am accuſed, I ſhall be
extreamly obliged to thoſe, who
will ſhew me the perſons, to whom
I have failed; and perhaps what
ſhall be done for me in the future
will take other Motives, than the
little Conſequences it may be of;
I was never to my remembrance,
reduced to that extremity: I
hope to correct my ſelf, and to give
a better Opinion of me, than is
had at preſent.</p>
            <p>This ſhows that the Count
anſwered well enough to the
gallantry that was made him.
He fancied it came by order of
the Queen; for there was only
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41286:85"/>
ſhe in that Court, who could
cauſe him to be writ to after
that manner, and he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in ſome manner to repair the
ill Figure he had made the night
before, of which one had but
too much reaſon to make him
reproaches. In the mean time
the Hunting ſeem'd to favour
him, in the deſign he had to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the Princeſs with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of his heart; but as he
was mounting his Horſe, he
was told ſhe would not be there,
and that ſhe was indiſpoſed.
What a deſpair for this Prince;
he took this unfortunate diſſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
as a deadly Omen
to his Love; and that he ſhould
ſucceed in nothing; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
troubling himſelf with what
he had writ, he returned to his
Chamber, where he walked a
long time, thinking what Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41286:85"/>
he ſhould take; for he
long'd to ſpeak that day to the
Princeſſe; his Gentleman of the
Horſe, who was an old <hi>French</hi>
Domeſtick, growing impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with expecting him, would
go ſee what hindred him from
following the Queen, who was
departed with all the Court an
hour before. He found him in
the poſture of a man, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
all ſad, all penſive, at
which he was much aſtoniſhed;
for this was very new to the
Count <hi>de Saluces.</hi> He knew not
what to ſay to him, but the
Count, who ſaw him troubled
without doubt at the Condition
in which he found him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
occaſion for him, knowing
his experience of the affairs of
the World, was willing to truſt
him with his ſecret, and to tell
him the pain in which he was.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41286:86"/>
               <hi>Richard,</hi> thus was the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the Horſe called, after
having ſeriouſly liſtened to his
Maſter, told him, that he did
not find he had ſo much reaſon
to be afflicted, though he ſhould
not ſpeak that to the Princeſs;
and that if he would write to
her, he aſſured him that he
would himſelf deliver the Letter.
The Count believed, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
he was, that it was the
ſhorteſt and eaſieſt for him; and
relying upon the addreſs of
<hi>Richard,</hi> in a time the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
was ſo fair, that all the
Court was abroad, he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to hazzard a Declaration by
Writeing; which he made in
theſe terms.</p>

            <p>This Letter finiſhed, <hi>Richard</hi>
took it, and prayed his Maſter
to rely on him for the Succeſs of
that affair, and that he would
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41286:87"/>
quickly bring him good News.
The Count mounted on his
Horſe to go to the Chaſe, and
his Gentleman of the Horſe went
to labour on his ſide to ſucceed
in the Commiſſion he had took
upon himſelf. It was an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
ſomething bold, in a
Country where they are not
pardoned; but the paſſion he
had to ſerve his Prince, would
have made him hazzard much
greater.</p>
            <p>The Queen impatiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
the Count <hi>de Saluces,</hi> who
came not; and wearied with
not ſeeing him, in the time ſhe
had been a hunting, ſhe inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid to <hi>Julia;</hi> Well! Well,
do you ſee how he comes? you
did not write to him obligingly
enough, or rather the Princeſs
has made him change his deſign.
<hi>Julia</hi> endeavoured to Comfort
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41286:87"/>
her, and told her that the time
was not paſſed, and that ſome
affair might have retained him,
and that ſhe believed him too
well bred a man to fail to come,
after having promiſed it.
The Queen was not at all of a
humour to divert her ſelf with
Hunting, ſo long as ſhe was in
that diſquiet whether he would
come or not; and that change
of humour was ſo remarkable
in her, who uſed to be in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
mirth, that the moſt
indifferent perceived it: The
Marquis and the <hi>Palatin</hi> intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in that affair, did all that
was poſſible to diſſipate that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
melancholly; but
they ſucceeded ſo ill, that on the
contrary they augmented her ill
humour by their importunity,
eſpecially the Marquis, who
thought to do wonders. The
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41286:88"/>
Count <hi>de Saluces</hi> at length arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to render her her former joy.
She manag'd her ſelf ſo little,
that ſhe quickly let all the world
ſee the pleaſure ſhe took in his
arrival, and there needed not
very much penetration to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
the favourable ſentiments
ſhe had for him; hitherto ſhe
ſeemed as if ſhe could not open
her mouth: but ſince the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of that Prince, her wit ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in all kinds. She propoſed
a thouſand ſorts of Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
of Courſes, of tilting, of
Shooting; and would always
be, or ſpeak for the Count <hi>de
Saluces</hi> againſt all others, from
whom indeed that happy Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
always carried the Prize:
It may be imagined with what
Eye the Marquis and the Count
<hi>Palatin</hi> ſaw all this: Into what
deſpair they were brought by
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41286:88"/>
the empreſſments the Queen
had for that young Rival; and
into what rage to ſee him the
Conquerour of all. I know
very well, that that day perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the rendring them his moſt
mortal Enemies; and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
yet more than the <hi>Palatin:</hi>
Becauſe Jealouſie had a greater
influence over him. In the
mean time that happy Rival
ſeem'd to have but little joy in
what cauſed the deſpair of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and at which the proud
Count <hi>Palatin</hi> was the moſt
outraged.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Saluces</hi> mind
run all upon the Succeſs the
enterprize of <hi>Richard</hi> would
have. How long are the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in thoſe occaſions, when
one expects the ſentence of Life
or of Death! but of a Death by
ſo much the more cruel, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41286:89"/>
the Life would be the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
that can be imagined. The
Gentleman of the Horſe came
not: He would have had him
gone as faſt as his mind. He
had accompanied him with his
Idea as far as the Palace, from
thence he had made him enter
into the Princeſſes Apartment;
yet without being able to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
how: He had ſeen him
ſpeak to her her ſelf, and had
made him ſay things the moſt
touching and the moſt paſſionate
for him in the World: After
which the Princeſs had took his
Letter, was moved, and had
made him an anſwer, ſuch as he
could deſire. By ill luck theſe
imaginations laſted not long,
for the Comedy changing Face,
they found themſelves quickly
deſtroyed by contrary viſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which repreſented to him as if
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41286:89"/>
all were loſt; that <hi>Richard</hi> had
been diſcovered and ſeiz'd; and
above all that, that the Princeſs
had ill received his Letter, and
that ſhe made no anſwer to it.
Of what tranquility was capable
the Soul of that poor Prince, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſo many different Winds,
good and contrary, with which
it was agitated, during the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of <hi>Richard?</hi> He arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at length to render it calm.
His Prince, who continually
turned his Head that way he
was to come, had no ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him, than that a trouble,
mixed with fear and joy, ſeized
him, and did not quit him till he
had learnt from his Servant all
he was to tell him.</p>
            <p>He ſtole inſenſibly from the
Company, and gain'd the <hi>Po,</hi>
near which they hunted, and
whither his Gentleman of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41286:90"/>
Horſe followed him. Well,
<hi>Richard,</hi> ſaid he to him, when
they were in a place, where no
body could either hear, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them, tell me quickly
what I am to hope? Haſt thou
ſucceeded? ſay, Muſt I live or
dye? Conceal nothing from me.
What are the Sentiments the
Princeſs has for me? My Lord,
anſwered the Gentleman of the
Horſe, you ought not to deſpair
of any thing; but I believe you
would be more happy without
the Scarf you wear. Ah Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
cryed the Count, ſhould
this Scarf be the cauſe of my
misfortune? It is at leaſt all the
reaſon, replyed <hi>Richard,</hi> which
was made uſe of not to give an
anſwer to your Letter. Learn
me, replyed ſighing the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Count, how all this is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?
For I do not comprehend
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41286:90"/>
it, and if it is onely that Scarf
which makes me unhappy, I
ſhall have quickly reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
for my good Fortune.</p>
            <p>My Lord, you muſt know,
continued <hi>Richard;</hi> that having
ſeen you on Horſeback to follow
the Queen, I dreſt my ſelf like
a <hi>French</hi> Courrier, and made
one of my Friends conduct me
to the Palace, where I am not
much known: I ſaid I came
from <hi>France,</hi> that I muſt ſpeak
with the Princeſs to deliver her
Letters from the Dauphins
Daughter; with whom all the
World knows ſhe has a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of Friendſhip; immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I was ſuffered to enter, and
was conducted to her Chamber,
where I found her very penſive,
and very melancholly, lying
upon a Couch. There was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with her one of her Women,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41286:91"/>
who likewiſe kept at a diſtance.
I approached her, and preſented
her your Letter; ſhe eyed me,
and whether I appear'd troubled
in entring, or that ſhe had ſome
foreknowledge, ſhe ſeem'd not
to take it without trembling,
nay, and changed Colour in
reading the ſuperſcription. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt the Character appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to her New; and I ſaw her
Ballance, if ſhe ſhould render it
me, or if ſhe ſhould open it. I
expected at leaſt that ſhe ſhould
ask me from whence the
Letter came; but ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
her ſelf with looking
on me once again, without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me any thing, examining
me ſeriouſly, as if ſhe would
have read in my Face what ſhe
ſhould believe. In fine, Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or perhaps ſomething more
ſtrong, maſtering ſo much irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41286:91"/>
ſhe broke it open, and
kept her Eyes on it above a
quarter of an hour, with moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which, if I may gueſs at by
thoſe of the Face, were not
diſadvantageous to you. After
that ſhe went into her Cabinet,
where ſhe was more than an
hour; I believed it was to make
you an anſwer; but calling for
me, and ſpeaking ſoftly to me,
You are miſtaken, ſaid ſhe to
me, rendring me your Letter;
this is not addreſſed to me. Hold,
carry that Letter to the Queen of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> for it is to her without
doubt it is written. I am too
old, Madam, anſwered I her,
to commit ſuch a fault; it is to
you my Prince ſent me: And in
the Condition I left him, I ſhould
rather chuſe to dye, than to
carry him back that Letter: For
the contempt he would ſee you
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41286:92"/>
make of it, Madam, would
caſt him into utter deſpair.
Well then, leave it with me,
ſaid ſhe, being hardly able to
hold from ſighing, and for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
tell him, that the Queen
would take it ill, that wearing her
Scarf he ſhould write to me the
things he does: and that for my
part it is yet worſe; and that I
pray him it may be the laſt time.
In finiſhing theſe words ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
me, and ſhut her ſelf up
in the ſame Cabinet. This, my
Lord, has been the ſucceſs of
my Voyage, which I do not
find unhappy for a beginning;
but if I durſt take the liberty to
give you advice, being old in
the World as I am—It is done,
interrupted the Count, as
long as I live, I will never
wear any Scarf, but from the
hand of <hi>Briſeida.</hi> Thereupon
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41286:92"/>
he fell to undo it from his Arm;
when the Queen, who had not loſt
ſight of him, ſince he was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the Company, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that way, and came juſt in
time to ſee him unty it; but
with an importment and a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as ſeem'd to her, againſt that
poor Scarf, that ſhe was mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vexed: And upon the point,
that <hi>Gaſpard de Saluces</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to give it to his Gentleman
of the Horſe, ſhe advanced from
under ſome trees, where ſhe
had ſtopped to ſee what he did:
It is to me, ſaid ſhe to him,
ſeizing it her ſelf, that it muſt be
reſtored: For in truth you are
not worthy to wear it. The
Count more ſurprized than he
had ever been in his Life, to ſee
and to hear the Queen, thought
ſhe had heard all the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had had with <hi>Richard,</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:41286:93"/>
and was upon the point to avow
to her that paſſion he had for the
Princeſs, to oblige her by that
ingenuous Confeſſion to pardon
him the action ſhe had ſeen him
do upon her Scarf: But the
Count <hi>Palatin</hi> arrived, who
finding in the poſture of the
Count <hi>de Saluces</hi> ſomething of
a man much ſurprized, and in
the Queens Face vexation and
choler, holding the Scarf in her
hands: The <hi>Palatin,</hi> I ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
the thing quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
than it was, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
to ſpeak; becauſe both
ſurprized at his arrival ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more. Certainly, Madam,
ſaid he, the Count <hi>de Saluces</hi>
muſt have committed ſome great
Crime againſt you, that you
take from him a Scarf Fortune
had ſo liberally given him. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would have made better
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41286:93"/>
uſe of it. You take too ſoon,
anſwered <hi>Gaſpard de Saluces</hi> the
Queens part, not to ſee that it is
for your ſelf you ſpeak; but it is
enough, purſued he, that you
had it not, to believe at
leaſt you deſerve it not ſo well:
That is a thing diſputable, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latin</hi>
repartee'd with a ſmile full
of haughtineſs, and—No, no,
interrupted the Queen, who ſaw
whither theſe words tended, It
is for me to decide. Hold
Count, continued ſhe, giving it
to the Count <hi>Palatin,</hi> but do not
preſume any thing from this
preſent. I make of them, as
things only obtained by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard;
and thoſe are not the good
ones. Though this, Madam,
anſwered the Count <hi>Palatin,</hi>
was ſuch a one, it would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for me, that I received it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41286:94"/>
from your fair hands, to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
proud. This diſcourſe was
again interrupted, by the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of the Marquis, who with
the groſs of the Troop ranged
himſelf by the Queen. She fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
this would cauſe reports,
and that it would be ſurprizing
to ſee it in the hands of the
Count <hi>Palatin,</hi> after having
ſeen it on the Arm of the Count
<hi>de Saluces,</hi> was willing to give
ſome colour to this affair, and
therefore to prevent rumours,
I come, ſaid ſhe laughing, from
puniſhing a deſerter, who has
ſeparated himſelf from the Troop
without leave. It ſeems to me
continued ſhe, with the ſame
tone of raillery, that a man whom
I had made my Knight, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him my Scarf, ought to be
more aſſiduous with me, or at
leaſt not to quit me without firſt
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41286:94"/>
letting me know. There were
ſeveral Repartees upon this,
which made a kind of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in which ſeveral Lords of
the Court were engaged for the
Count <hi>de Saluces</hi>'s part; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
himſelf ſo weakly, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
ſo cold to all that raillery,
that it was apparent he was but
little concerned as his diſgrace:
On the contrary he appeared to
be more and more of a better hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
whether it proceeded from
the kindneſs he believed the
Queen had done him, in having
acted thus; or that he did it, not
to let his Rivals have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to imagine he had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
at what had hapned, as
they did not fail to believe,
though he laugh'd and raillyed
as the others. The Queen alone
was deadly vext. She knew
not what reaſon could have
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41286:95"/>
moved that Prince to do what
he had done to that Scarf, after
having worn it two days in the
Eyes of the all World. She eaſily
fancied there was ſome myſtery
in it, into which ſhe could not
penetrate, and that all the ill
came from that man with whom
ſhe had found him diſcourſing.
The mind of a Woman goes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
far when ſhe is touched to the
quick, eſpecially of a jealous
Woman: ſhe had a thouſand
imaginations upon that affair:
She made a hundred deſigns to
diſcover the Intrigue, and took
care to have him ſpied, whom ſhe
thought the cauſe of all that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
to know whom he was, to
whom he belonged, from whence
he came, and what he would do,
during the Chace. But as it
was already Dinner time, the
Marquis made towards that ſide
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41286:95"/>
where he had prepared a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
treat, where all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
came; and the Queen was
there treated after an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
manner, conſidering it was
in the middle of a Field.</p>
            <p>They had hardly took away,
when one of thoſe ſhe had ſet to
obſerve the Count <hi>de Saluces</hi> man,
came and told her, that it was
his Gentleman of the Horſe, who
was to return to <hi>Cazal</hi> to carry a
Letter that his Maſter had juſt
given him; but that he knew not
for whom it was, and that he
could draw nothing more from
him. The fair Queen loſt no time,
her jealouſie gave her not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of truce, and calling for one
of her Gentlemen, in whom ſhe
much relyed: She bid him take
with him three or four of her
Guards, to diſguiſe them, and to
go watch in the way to <hi>Cazal</hi> for
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41286:96"/>
a man, that he, ſpeaking of her
Spye, ſhould ſhew him; to ſeize
and ſearch him, without doing
him any hurt, and to take all the
Papers and Letters that ſhould be
found about him. The Gentleman
executed very punctually the
Queens Order. He went and hid
himſelf in a Wood, that was half
a League from <hi>Cazal,</hi> through
which <hi>Richard</hi> was to paſs; who
no ſooner appeared than that
four Horſemen, making ſhew of
going towards the City, ſeiz'd
him by ſurprize, demanded his
Purſe; and found not about him
any other Paper than a Letter;
the Gentleman immediately car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
it to the Queen, while that
the others drew poor <hi>Richard</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the thickeſt of the Wood to
keep him till new Order.</p>
