         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ACCOUNT
OF THE
Tryal and Conviction
OF
Sir John Friend,
FOR
HIGH-TREASON
In Conſpiring the DEATH of His Moſt Sacred
Majeſty, King WILLIAM, and the Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Government. &amp;c.</head>
            <head type="sub">At the Seſſions-Houſe, in the Old-Baily: <date>On Monday,
the 23d. of this Inſtant March, 1696.</date> Before the
Right Honourable the Lord Chief Juſtice Holt, the
Lord Chief Juſtice Treby, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>NEver was Conſpiracy, more happily, and more fully diſcovered
than the late horrid Deſign for the barbarous Aſſaſſination of
His Majeſties Perſon, the Invaſion of the Kingdom, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the Government, and conſequently the <hi>Proteſtant
Religion;</hi> when beſide the Number, and withal the Credit of
the Witneſſes, we have the publick Confeſſion of the Dying Criminals
themſelves, <hi>ex ore ſuo,</hi> making their own voluntary ſelf Condemnation;
and ever juſtifying both their Accuſers, and their own Execution; as
their own Papers, delivered to the Hands of the Sheriff; and ſince Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
by Authority ſuffitiently teſtifie.</p>
            <p>But to Ballance the Caſe between the three Unfortunate <hi>Romiſh Zealots,</hi>
viz. <hi>Charnock, King,</hi> and <hi>Keys,,</hi> that have already received <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and the
preſent Criminal Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> now brought to the Bar of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to receiveing it, we have this unhappy Difference between them; That,
of the Two, this unfortunate Gentleman lies under (if poſſible) the much
more hainous, and leſs pittied Circumſtances; For though there can
be no Apology for Guilt ſo Barbarous on either ſide, yet certainly it muſt
be an infinite Aggravation of the Crime in Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> profeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Member of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> whereas the other Three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victs
were all Papiſts, and conſequently were miſlead by ſome Impulſe of
Blind Zeal, a Bigotted Superſtition that might animate this Conſpiracy, in
favour both of their own Altars, and their darling Champion of them the
late <hi>K. J</hi>—'s: But Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> under his contrary Capacity, when
Embark'd in the ſame Black Cauſe, beſides the Blot in their Scutcheon
<pb facs="tcp:66091:2"/>
has this additional Stain in his, <hi>viz.</hi> Not only of ſuch perfidious <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Treaſon againſt his <hi>King</hi> and Country, but even againſt himſelf; for
no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> can liſt under ſuch a Bloody <hi>Banner,</hi> but in realiiy muſt be
an Actor in his own, as well as his Countries Ruin: And certainly it muſt
be no common Infatuation that could miſguide and enſnare a Man into ſo
horrid and likewiſe ſo ſtupid a Confederacy, where the Phrenzy of <hi>Rebellion</hi>
edges and arms the drawn Sword even againſt our own Throats.</p>
            <p>And if there can be Degrees of the moſt Capital Sins, it lies a
a little more heavy upon this unfortunate Offendor, who with
that Maſs of Wealth, and thoſe Smiles of Fortune, ſhould never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
debaſe himſelf to the engaging in ſo wicked a Cauſe, when
Profligate Lives and Deſperate Fortunes (one would think)
ſhould only be tempted to <hi>Fiſh in Troubled Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been Remarkt, that never were more Generous, and thoſe
Repeated, Tenders of <hi>Mercy</hi> offered, than to Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> from
the King's own Mouth, upon his Examination before the Councel;
but his Obſtinacy, and hardened Denial of his Offence, and ſome
other ill Aſcendants over made him, reject the Royal Clemency,
till too late to be recalled, which has brought him to this
deplorabel Scene.</p>
            <p>Being brought upon his Tryal, on <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>23d.</hi> of this
Inſtant <hi>March,</hi> after <hi>Ten</hi> in the <hi>Morning,</hi> which continued till
<hi>Two</hi> in the Afternoon. The greateſt Streſs of the Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, beſides his General Aſſiſtance in the <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> was
his Acceptance of a <hi>Collonels Commiſſion</hi> for Raiſing a Regiment
of Horſe; it being proved by <hi>Capt. Porter</hi> and <hi>Mr. Blair,</hi> that he
had choſen all his <hi>Captains,</hi> (who were all mentioned) and had
met them at ſeveral Taverns and elſewhere in this <hi>City,</hi> and had
Paid ſeveral Sums of <hi>Mony</hi> for carrying on the cauſe: The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

to invalidate the credit of the Witneſſes, as being <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but
that was Over-ruled. In ſhort after a long Tryal and Full Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Jury went out, and ſoon Returning, brought him in
