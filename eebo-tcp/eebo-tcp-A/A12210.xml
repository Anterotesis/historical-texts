            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But as God is true, our word towards you was not <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay;</hi> for the Sonne of God, Iesus Christ, who was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched among you by us, was not <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> but in him was <hi>yea.</hi>

               <hi>him</hi> Amen, <hi>unto the glory of God by us.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, that he might have the better place in the hearts of his hearers, endeavours here with all diligence to wipe off any imputation, which they might have against him, that so his doctrine might come home to their soules, and have the freer accesse to worke upon their consciences.</p>
            <p>We have therefore in these words <hi>S. Pauls</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, for not comming unto the <hi>Chorinthians</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise. Wherein hee alledgeth that it was not from any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2552:3"/>
inconstancy in <hi>him;</hi> but indeed from corruption in manners among <hi>them.</hi> verse 23. <hi>I call God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that to spare you I came not.</hi> The Apostle as a <hi>man,</hi> and as a <hi>holy</hi> man, might promise many things common to this life, and might lawfully vary afterwards, upon the appearance of reall impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.</p>
            <p>But the things which he promiseth, and speakes of as an <hi>Apostle,</hi> they admit of no such uncertainty. Therefore his care is to decline all thoughts of wavering therein, and to maintaine the credit of the Gospell, which hee had taught to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2552:4"/>
knowing well, how ready <hi>false teachers</hi> would be to perswade the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that <hi>Paul</hi> was as light in his preaching, as he was in keeping his word with them, therefore our <hi>Word is true, as God is true,</hi> saith he.</p>
            <p>There is the same ground of the certainty of Evangelicall truths, as there is of God himselfe. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> whom I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched among you was not <hi>yea and nay,</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, but <hi>yesterday and to day,</hi> and the same <hi>for ever.</hi> Whence may bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the object of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> 
               <hi>now in the time of the Gospell, is especially Iesus</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:2552:4"/>
               <hi>Christ.</hi> This is the Rock upon which the Church is built. Christ should be the subject matter of our teaching, in his <hi>Nature, Offices,</hi> and <hi>Benefits,</hi> in the duties which we owe to him, and the instrument whereby we receive all from him, which is <hi>faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If wee preach the <hi>Law,</hi> and discover mens cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it is but to make way for the Gospels freer passage into their soules. And if we presse holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is to make you walke worthy of the Lord Jesus. All teaching is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive to the Gospell of Christ, either to make way as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did, to levell all proud thoughts,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2552:5"/>
and make us stoop to him, or to make us walk worthy of the grace wee receive from him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bread of life</hi> must be broken, the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> must bee anatomized and layed open; the riches of Christ, even his unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches, must bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded. <hi>The Sonne of God</hi> must be preached to all, and therefore God who hath appointed us to bee saved by Christ, hath also ordained preaching, to lay open the Lord Iesus, with the heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of his grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But to go forward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iesus Christ who was preached among you, by</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:2552:5"/>
               <hi>me, and</hi> Sylvanus, <hi>and</hi> Tymotheus, <hi>was not yea and nay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here observe: <hi>That the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Observ.</note> 
               <hi>consent of Preachers in the mysteries of salvation, is an excellent meanes to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then faith in their hearers:</hi> not in regard of the truth it selfe, but in regard of men. So it pleaseth God to condescend to our weaknesse, in adding <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> unto his promises, thereby to shew the more stablenesse of his counsell towards us.</p>
            <p>By <hi>yea</hi> here is meant <hi>Certaine, Constant, Vnva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable.</hi> The times vary, but not the faith of the times. The same funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2552:6"/>
truth is in all ages. Sometimes indeed it is more explicated, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded; as we have in the the <hi>New Testament</hi> divers truths more cleerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed than in the <hi>Old.</hi> There is not a new <hi>faith,</hi> but a larger explication of the old faith. Divine truth is alwayes the same. If there hath beene a <hi>Church</hi> alwayes, there hath ever beene a Divine truth. Now it is an <hi>Article</hi> of our faith in all times to beleeve a <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then there must bee a Catholike truth, to be the seed of this Church. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should search out, what was that <hi>yea,</hi> that positive Doctrine in those
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2552:6"/>
Apostolicall times of the Churches purity before it was corrupted.</p>
            <p>The Church was not long a Virgin, yet some there were that held the truth of Christ in all ages. Our present Church holds the same positive truths, with the Apostles before us. Therefore we say, <hi>Our Church was before Luther,</hi> because our <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> is Apostolicall, as also is our <hi>Church</hi> that is continued thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is built upon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall doctrine. Put the case we cannot shew the men as they redicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously urge; what is that to the purpose? From an ignorance of particular
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2552:7"/>
men, will they conclude us to be ignorant of the Church of Christ, which hath ever beene.</p>
            <p>Hence the true Church may easily be discerned: the points of Religion wherein our adversaries differ from us, be but pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries of their <hi>owne,</hi> they were not <hi>yea.</hi> In the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times,</hi> their <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Invocation of Saints,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> of divers kindes were devised by themselves afterwards. And indeed for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres after Christ, many of the differences betwixt us and the <hi>Papists</hi> were never heard of; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they ever esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by any Counsell,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2552:7"/>
till the <hi>Counsell of Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our positive points are grounded upon the holy <hi>Scriptures;</hi> we seek the <hi>Old way,</hi> and the best <hi>way,</hi> as <hi>Ieremy</hi> adviseth us. There was no popish trash in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> time, among the blessed <hi>Patriarches,</hi> nor in Christs time. No, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred yeares after; they came in by little and little, by humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for their owne advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; a meere policy to get money and abuse the people. Indeed they hold many of our truths, but they adde something of their owne to them; they adde necessity of <hi>traditi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on</hi> to the Scriptures, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to <hi>faith;</hi> they adde
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2552:8"/>
               <hi>Saints</hi> to Christ in Divine <hi>Worship:</hi> they have seven <hi>Sacraments</hi> to our <hi>two.</hi> They may safelier there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come to us, than we to them; we hold all that they should hold, onely their owne additions wee hold not, we leave them to themselves. So much for that.</p>
            <p>To touch only another point, that borders a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <note place="margin">Doct.</note> upon it. <hi>Divine truth is of an inflexible nature;</hi> this crosseth another rule of theirs; for they hold, they may give what sense of <hi>Scripture</hi> they will: and that the current of the present <hi>Church,</hi> must judge of all former coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels. What? Doth the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2552:8"/>
truth vary according to mens judgements? must we bring the strait Rule to the crooked Timber for to be measured? Shall the judgement of any man, be the rule of Gods unerring truth? Shall present men interpret it thus, and say, it is so now? And shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that succeed after say, what ever it was then, now it is thus: and must we beleeve all? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</p>
            <p>This declareth, <hi>That no</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note> 
               <hi>man can dispence with Gods Law:</hi> this written Word is alike in all: truth is truth, and errour errour, whether men think it to be so or no. Reason is reason, in <hi>Turkes,</hi> as well
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2552:9"/>
as amongst us. The light of nature, is the light of nature, in any Countrey as well as here. Principles of nature vary not as Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages doe: they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred things. And if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of nature be inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and indispensable, much more is <hi>Divinity.</hi> Filth is filth wee all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse: opinion ought not to bee the rule of things, but the nature of the thing it selfe.</p>
            <p>Therefore what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst nature, none can dispence withall. God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny himselfe. What is naught in one age, is naught in another, and for ever naught. There is no Monarch in the World
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2552:9"/>
can dispence with the Law of nature, or with the Divine Law of God. For the opinion of any man in the World, is not the rule which hee may comfortably live by, but the undoubted light of Christs written Word.</p>
            <p>I speake this the rather to crosse their base practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who when God cals them to stand for his cause and truth, they will bend and bow the sacred truth, which is alwayes <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> to their owne by ends and base respects. As if the opinion of any man in the world were the rule of their faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. This is to make God no God. Is not right,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2552:10"/>
right? Is not the Law the Law? Is not the Word of Christ a word that alters not, but remaines stedfast to all eternity?</p>
            <p>Assure your selves there is a truth of God, that we must maintaine to the death, not onely in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Heresie, but resisting of impiety wheresoever we meet it. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was a Martyr when hee stood out against <hi>Herod</hi> and said, <hi>Thou must not have thy Brother Philips</hi> Wife. He would not be meale-mouth'd in reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his sinne, but cried out against the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, though it cost him his life. Men ought to suffer for the truth, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2552:10"/>
not for base ends deny the least word of <hi>God,</hi> because it is a divine sparkle from himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For all the promises of God, in him are</hi> yea, <hi>and in him are</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>This comes in after this manner: the word that I preached (saith <hi>Paul)</hi> is unvariable, because Christ himselfe is alwayes <hi>yea,</hi> and I have preached no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Jesus Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you; my preaching then must needs be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and immutable truth.</p>
            <p>There are divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the words, but the most materiall is (as this Translation and the best Expositors have it)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2552:11"/>
               <hi>All the promises of God</hi> in Christ are <hi>yea,</hi> (that is,) they are certaine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in <hi>him.</hi> And then they are <hi>Amen,</hi> that is, in Christ they are fulfilled. In him they are made, and in him they are accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. The whole carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the promises are in Christ: for his sake they were first given, and in him they shall be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. As Christ himselfe was <hi>yesterday, and to day, and the same for ever:</hi> so are all Gods promises made in <hi>him,</hi> undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, eternally, and unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gably true to all posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Here are divers truths which offer themselves to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2552:11"/>
our consideration. First take notice, that since the fall of man, it hath pleased our good God to establish a <hi>Covenant of grace</hi> in Jesus Christ, and to make him a second <hi>Adam,</hi> by whom we might be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a better estate, than ever wee had in the first <hi>Adam.</hi> In which happy condition there can be no intercourse betwixt God and man, without some promise in his Christ: so that God now deales all by promises with us. The reason is this, how can poore dust and ashes dare to challenge any thing of the great Majesty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without a warrant from himselfe? How can
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2552:12"/>
the Conscience be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? <note place="margin">Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, what.</note> 
               <hi>(Conscience</hi> you know <hi>is a knowledge together with God.)</hi> How can that rest quiet in any thing, but in what it is assured comes from God? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Why God rules his Church by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> for any good I hope for from God, it behooves me to have some promise, and word of his mouth for it, this being his constant course of dispensation to his people. <hi>While we live in this world we are alwayes under hope.</hi> We rejoyce in hope of the glory of God. Now hope lookes still to the promise, whereof some part is unperfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>How doth Heaven dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from Earth? but in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2552:12"/>
this: Heaven is a place all for performances: here we have some performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to encourage us, but are alwayes under some <hi>promise</hi> not yet accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. And therefore the manner of our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God in this world, exceedingly differs from that in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Here it is by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> there it is by <hi>vision:</hi> vision is fit for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> looke alwayes to a word revealed: God therefore rules his Church in this manner for their greater good. Alas what can we have from God, but by the manifestation of hiis own good will? May we look
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2552:13"/>
for favour from God for any thing in our selves? It is a fond conceit.</p>
            <p>Againe, God will have his <hi>Church</hi> ruled by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> in all ages, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the faithfull in <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> upon him. God will see of what cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is amongst men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will rely upon his bare promise or no. He might doe us good, and give us no <hi>promise;</hi> but he will try his graces in us, by arming us against all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments till the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised be performed to us. <hi>Promises</hi> are (as it were) the stay of the soule in an imperfect condition, and so is faith in them, untill
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2552:13"/>
our hopes shall end in full possession: and wee must know, that <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of Divine Promises.</note> 
               <hi>are better than earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performances.</hi> Let God give man never so much in the world, if hee have not a promise of better things, all will come to nothing at the last. And therefore God supports the spirits of his servants against all temptations, both on the right hand and on the left by sweet promises. Hee will have them live by <hi>faith,</hi> which alwayes hath relation to a <hi>Promise.</hi> This is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ground then, that God now in Christ Jesus hath appointed to governe his <hi>Church</hi> by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:2552:14"/>
But what is a Promise?</p>
            <p>A <hi>Promise</hi> is nothing but a manifestation of <note place="margin">Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a promise.</note> love; an intendment of bestowing some good, and removing some evill from us. A declaring of a mans free engagement in this kinde, is a <hi>Promise;</hi> it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes comes from <hi>love</hi> in the party promising, and conveighs goodnesse to the beleeving soule. Now what love can there be in God to us (since the <hi>fall,)</hi> which must not be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on a better foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than our selves? If <hi>God</hi> love us, it must be in one that is, first beloved; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon comes the ground of the promises to be in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ: all intercourse
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2552:14"/>
between God and us must be in <hi>him</hi> that is able to satisfie God for us. The Almighty Creator will have our debts discharged before he enters into a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of peace with us.</p>
            <p>Now this Christ hath perfectly done, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reconciled lost sinners; hereupon the promise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately issues (from Gods love in Christ) to beleeving soules: <hi>He</hi> must <hi>first</hi> receive all good for us, and we must have it at the <hi>second hand</hi> from him. The promises in Christ are as the spirits in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they runne through al the ages of the Church; without him there is no mercy nor comfort to be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2552:15"/>
had. God cannot look on this cursed nature of ours out of Christ; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whosoever appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends any mercy from God, he must apprehend it in Christ the promised seed. To make it clearer; our nature since the <hi>fall</hi> is odious to God, (a sinfull cursed nature remaines in the best of us) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God may looke peaceably upon it, he must looke upon it in him that hath it undefiled, &amp; in him whom he loves, even his only Son, like unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that hath taken our nature upon him.</p>
            <p>Now our nature in Christ must needs be love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and acceptable; and if
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2552:15"/>
ever God love us, it is for Christ alone, who was predestinated before all worlds, to be a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for us, to be the Head of <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 10</note> his <hi>Church:</hi> he was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to doe us good, before we our selves were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Christ is the first Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and then we: God loves us in his beloved one: <hi>This is my beloved</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark 1. 11</note> 
               <hi>Sonne in whom I am well pleased.</hi> As if the Lord had said, I am pleased in him, and in all his, in his whole mysticall body. Christ is the Son of God by nature, we by <hi>adoption;</hi> what ever good is in us, is first &amp; principally in him. God conveighs all by the naturall Son to the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2552:16"/>
sonnes: therefore <hi>all the promises are made to us in Christ,</hi> he takes them from God for us. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is the first Promise, and all are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in him: they are not dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to us, abstracted from him; but we are elected in Christ, sanctified in <hi>him,</hi> acquitted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin through him: <hi>by his stripes we are healed.</hi> If Christ had not satisfied the wrath of <hi>God,</hi> by bearing our iniquities upon the crosse, wee had beene liable every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to condemnation. If he had not been free from our sins, we had for ever lyen under the burthen of them. <hi>You are yet in your sinnes</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Paul) if</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:2552:16"/>
               <hi>Christ be not risen.</hi> We are <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 17.</note> freed from our debts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ our surety is out of prison; he is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore we are at liberty.</p>
            <p>The Promises are a deed of gift, which wee have from and by Christ, who is the first object of all the respect that God hath to us. Why are the Angels attendants on us? Because they attend upon <hi>Iacobs Ladder,</hi> (that is,) upon Christ, that knits Heaven and Earth together. So that the Angels because they attend upon Christ first, become likewise our attendants: we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of <hi>eternall life:</hi> but this life is <hi>in his Son;</hi> God
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2552:17"/>
blesseth us with all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall blessings in <hi>him,</hi> and makes us sons in him the naturall Sonne: whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever prerogative we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, it is in Christ first, and so belongs to us, but no further than we by <hi>faith</hi> are made one with him. How darest thou think of <hi>God</hi> who is a <hi>Consuming fire?</hi> and not think of him as he is pleased and pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thy person in Christ, who tooke thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him, to be a foundation of comfort, and a <hi>second Adam;</hi> a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique person satisfying Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice for all that are members of his body?</p>
            <p>Wee may think upon God with comfort, when
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2552:17"/>
wee see him appeased in his Christ. As long as hee loves Christ, hee cannot but love us. Never think to have grace, or salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any thing without Christ. Doth God love mee, doth hee doe good to my soule for my owne sake (abstracted from his Sonne?) no surely: then should I flie from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. But he looks upon me in his <hi>beloved,</hi> and in him accepts of my person, therefore our Saviour prayeth, <hi>I desire thee bles sed Father, that the love wherewith thou lovest mee, may be in them, and I in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This should direct us in our dealing with God, not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2552:18"/>
to goe directly to him, but by a <hi>Promise,</hi> And when wee have a <hi>Promise,</hi> look to Christ in whom it is performed; If we ask any thing of God in <hi>Christs name,</hi> he will give it us; If wee thank God for any thing, thank him in Christ, that wee have it <hi>in him.</hi> What a comfort is this, that wee may goe to God in Christ, and claime the <hi>Promises</hi> boldly? because he loves us with the same love he beares to his only beloved Sonne. If we get fast hold on Christ, and cleave there, God can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone alter his love to him, as alter his love to us; his love is every whit as unchangeable to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2552:18"/>
member, as to Christ the head of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The <hi>Promises</hi> are as sure as the <hi>love of God in Christ is,</hi> upon which they are founded, and from which <hi>nothing can sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us.</hi> For <hi>Promises</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fruit of Gods love, and Gods love being founded first upon Christ: it must needs follow, that all the <hi>Promises</hi> are both <hi>made,</hi> and made <hi>good</hi> to us through him.</p>
            <p>If a Prince should love a man, and his love should be founded upon the love he beares to his own Son; surely such a one may have comfort, that love will never faile him: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is an affection na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2552:19"/>
and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, he will alwayes love his Sonne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will alwayes delight in him, in whom his Son delighteth. Now Christ is the everlasting Sonne of the Father; his deare and only Sonne, in whom hee is ever well pleased, and through whom he cannot be offended with those that are his. So surely as God loves Christ, so sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee loves all that are united to him. There is nothing in the world can separate his love from his owne Sonne, neither is there any thing able to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate his love from us <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> that are <hi>one</hi> with him. God loves Christs mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2552:19"/>
body, as well as his naturall body; hee hath advanced that to glory at his right hand in heaven, and will hee (think you) leave his mysticall body <hi>the Church</hi> in a state of abasement here on earth? No certainly: God loves every member of his Son; for as he gave <hi>us</hi> to Christ, so <hi>Him</hi> hath he sealed and annointed to be a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for his people.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why God looks upon us with a forbearing eye (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall matter of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure hee finds in us) hee looks on us in his <hi>Sonne,</hi> his love to us is grounded on his love to Christ. And
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2552:20"/>
hereupon comes our <hi>bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that wee can goe to him in all distresses with comfort, &amp; say, Lord look on thy Son who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hast given for us, and in him behold his poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers now before thee: In our selves we have <hi>dread,</hi> but in thy dearly beloved wee have joy in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. If we come in the garments of our Elder brother, wee are sure to get a blessing, but in our selves God cannot endure to behold us: If we bring <hi>Benjamin</hi> to our Father; if wee carry Christ along with us, then come and welcome.</p>
            <p>Upon what unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2552:20"/>
grounds is the <hi>love</hi> of God and the faith of a Christian builded? How can the gates of hell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile against the <hi>faith</hi> of a true beleever, when it is carried to the <hi>promise,</hi> and from the promise to Gods love? the love of God to Christ shall as soone faile, as the faith of a sincere Christian shal be shaken. The promises else should bee of no effect, they should be <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> and not <hi>Yea</hi> &amp; <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the promises could bee shaken, the love of God and Christ should be uncertain. Overturn hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, if we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the faith of a true persevering Christian.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2552:21"/>
There is nothing in the world of that firmnesse as a beleeving soule is, the ground hee stands upon makes him unmoveable. Our union with the Lord Jesus makes us like <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> that cannot be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. But wee must know there are three degrees or steps of love, whereof a promise is the last.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Inward love.</item>
               <item>2. Reall performance.</item>
               <item>3. A manifestation of performance inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before it bee done.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Love concealed doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort in the <hi>interim;</hi> therfore God who is <hi>love,</hi> doth not only affect us for the present, and intend us
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2552:21"/>
mercy hereafter: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee will have us rest sweetly in his bosome, and settle our selves on his gracious purposes, hee gives us in the mean time many <hi>rich and pretious promises.</hi> Hee not only loves us, and shewes the same in deeds <hi>now,</hi> but he expresseth his future care of us, that wee may build on him, as surely as if we had the thing performed already.</p>
            <p>By this wee see how God loves us, he hath not only an inward liking and good wil to us in his brest, but manifests the same by <hi>word;</hi> hee reveales the tendernesse of his bowells towards us, that wee may
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2552:22"/>
have the comfort of it before-hand: God would have us live by <hi>faith,</hi> and establish our selves in <hi>hope,</hi> because these graces fit us for the promise. If there were no <hi>Promises,</hi> there could bee no <hi>faith</hi> nor <hi>hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is <hi>Hope,</hi> but the expectation of those <note place="margin">Faith and Hope what they are, and of what use.</note> things that the word saith? And what is <hi>faith,</hi> but a building on the promise of God? <hi>Faith</hi> looks to the word of the thing, <hi>Hope</hi> to the thing in the word. <hi>Faith</hi> looks to the thing promised, <hi>Hope</hi> to the possession and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it. <hi>Faith is the evidence of good not seene,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> (making that which is <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:2552:22"/>
as <hi>present</hi> to us) <hi>Hope</hi> waits for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the word; if we had nothing promised, what need <hi>hope?</hi> and where were the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>faith?</hi> But God being willing to satisfie both, (that wee may bee heavenly-wise, in relying upon a firme foundation; and not as fooles, <hi>trust in vanity)</hi> in mercy gives us <hi>promises,</hi> and seales them with an oath for our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter supportment. That love which ingaged the Almighty to bind himself to us in <hi>pretious promises,</hi> will furnish us likewise with grace needfull, till wee be possessed of them.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2552:23"/>
He will give us leave to depend upon him, both for happinesse and all qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting graces which may support the soule till it come to its perfect rest in himselfe.</p>
            <p>Now these gratious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of our good God may be reduced into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers rankes. I will but touch some few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and shew how wee should carry our selves to make a comfortable use of them.</p>
            <p>First, there are some <note place="margin">Division of the Promises.</note> 
               <hi>universall Promises</hi> for the good of all mankinde, as that <hi>God would never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the World againe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promises that more
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2552:23"/>
               <hi>particularly</hi> concerne the Church, and these are Promises.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Either of <hi>outward things.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Or of</hi> spirituall and eternall things
<list>
                     <item>of Grace.</item>
                     <item>and Glory.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>In the manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising, they admit of this distinction. All the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God are made to us, either</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Absolutely,</hi> without any condition; so was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of sending Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious comming againe to judgement: let the world be as it will, yet Christ did come, and will come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with thousands of Angels, to judge us at the last.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:2552:24"/>
Or 2. <hi>conditionall.</hi> As the Promise of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> to Gods children that he will forgive their sinnes, if they repent, &amp;c. God deales with men (as wee doe by way of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi> one with another) propounding mercy by <hi>covenant</hi> and <hi>condition:</hi> yet his covenant of grace is alwayes a <hi>gratious cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> For he not onely gives the good things, but helpes us in performing the condition by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he workes our hearts to beleeve and to <hi>repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus all Promises for <note place="margin">Temporal promises conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> 
               <hi>outward things</hi> are <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall:</hi> as thus, God hath promised protection from contagious <hi>sicknesse,</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2552:24"/>
from <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>warre,</hi> that he will be <hi>an hiding place,</hi> and a <hi>Deliverer</hi> of his people in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that he will doe this and that good for them. But these are <hi>conditionall,</hi> so far forth as in his wise providence he sees they may helpe to preserve spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good things in them, and advance the graces of the inward man. For God takes liberty in our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward estate, to afflict us or doe us good, as may best further our soules welfare. Because do what we can with these bodies, they will turn to dust and vanity ere long. We must, leave the world behinde us; therefore he lookes to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2552:25"/>
our main estate in Christ, to the new creature; and so farre as outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings may cherish and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease that, so farre hee grants them, or else he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies them to his dearest ones.</p>
            <p>For we cannot still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the blessings of this life, but our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is such, that (except we have somewhat to sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the same) we shall sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet, and not digest them; therefore they are all gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with exception of the <hi>Crosse,</hi> as Christ saith, hee that doth for him any thing, <hi>shall have a hundred</hi>

Christians looke for cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to season those good things they enjoy in this life.</p>
            <p>To come now to some <note place="margin">Vse.</note> use of the point. Are all the Promises of what kind soever, whether <hi>spirituall</hi> and <hi>outward, temporall</hi> or <hi>eternall,</hi> are they all made to us in Jesus Christ? And are they certainly true, <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in him? Then I beseech you get into Christ betimes, strengthen your intrest in him by all meanes, out of whom we have nothing that is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly good: rest not in any thing abstracted from him, so as to be accepted with God.</p>
            <p>But you will say, doth <note place="margin">Object.</note>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:2552:26"/>
not God doe many good things to them that are out of Christ? doth not the Sunne shine, and the raine fall, upon the just and the unjust, upon the evill, as well as the good? doth he not cloath, and feed, and protect wicked men daily?</p>
            <p>He doth indeed, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee denied; but are <note place="margin">Answ.</note> they blessings? are these favours to them? No, but as God saith by <hi>Moses,</hi> if thou sin against me, <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed shalt thou be in thy Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut 28. 16.</note> 
               <hi>and thy store. Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy Land, the increase of thy Kine, and the flocks of thy Sheep: cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at home, cursed abroad:</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:2552:26"/>
they are cursed in their very blessings. A grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse brutish person, though hee swim with worldly pleasures, and have never such reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, and commings in to maintaine his bravery, is yet an accursed creature in the midst of all. For what are we made for, think you? To live here only? Oh no: then we were of all others the most miserable: there is an eternity of time a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, wherein (after a few dayes spent in the flesh) we shall live either in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall blisse, or unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torment.

            <p>Another man hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent payment, and that is all he cares for, hee hath

something in hand, and fwells with a conceit of happinesse thereby; Alas, what are we the better to have a great deale of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? <hi>Solomon</hi> that had tryed all the world, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves it to <hi>vanity and vexation of spirit.</hi> All things below are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and wee are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in the use of them; if we have no better a life than a natural one, eternal joy appertaines not to us.

things, with a great deale of addition of miserie, which his ease and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, makes him more sensible of, as being more tender and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive of an evill than other men.

            <p>Besides that wee have here in performance, wee have many excellent <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> of a greater good in expectation, which in Christ are all <hi>Yea</hi> &amp; <hi>Amen.

            <p>Therefore build on his <hi>promise:</hi> for <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Word</hi> are all one.

            <p>The promises are our inheritance, yea our best inheritance in this life; though the Lord should strip us naked, and take

            <p>God is therefore faine to humble his children to teach them dependance.

            <p>In the times of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, there was fire and faggot, and the frownes of bloudy men; but who were the persons suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring?

            <p>
               <hi>Meanes to obtaine stabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By what meanes may a Christian obtaine this sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing grace.</p>
            <p>First, labour for funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall <note place="margin">Helpes to obt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ine confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming grace.</note> graces: if the root be strengthened, the Tree will stand fast. <hi>Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is a speciall radicall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> grace; the foundation of Religion is very low; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement of spirit is in all the parts of holinesse: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grace hath a mixture of humility, because they are all dependances on God.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2552:41"/>
Humility is an emptying grace, and acknowledgeth that in our selves there is nothing. If God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his influence, I am gone; if he withdraw his grace, I shall be like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, as <hi>Sampson</hi> was when his haire was cutoff. Selfe-emptinesse prepares for spirituall fulnesse: <hi>When I am weak</hi> (saith bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Paul) then I am strong;</hi> that is, when I feele and acknowledge my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then my strength encreases; otherwise a man is not strong when he is weake, but when he is sensible and groanes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burthen of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, then is he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly strong.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:2552:41"/>
Another fundamentall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> grace, is <hi>dependance</hi> upon God; for considering our owne insufficiency, and that <hi>faith</hi> is a grace that goes out of our selves, and layes hold of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of another to justi fie us, nothing can be more necessary to quiet the soule: <hi>Beleeve and you shall be established:</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are sure in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, so should we repose firme confidence in them.</p>
            <p>But how doth God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish <note place="margin">Object.</note> us by faith?</p>
            <p>By working sound <note place="margin">Answ.</note> knowledge in us; <hi>This is life eternall to know thee, Iohn</hi> 17. When we know the truth of Gods word aright, we have a firme
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2552:42"/>
ground to depend on: for the more a man knowes God in Covenant, the more hee knowes Christ and the promises, the more he will trust and rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. <hi>They that know</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 9. 10.</note> 
               <hi>thy name will trust in thee;</hi> saith the Prophet. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour for certainty of <hi>knowledge,</hi> that thou maist have a certainty of <hi>faith:</hi> What is the reason our faith is weak? Because wee are carelesse to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in knowledge. The more wee know of God, the morewe shall trust in him. The more we know of a man that he is able and just of his word, the more safely we put confidence in him. So the more our
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2552:42"/>
security is in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, as his bonds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, so our trust will be strengthened.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if thou wouldst have stablishing grace, beg <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <note place="margin"> Sue the Promises in Prayer.</note> it earnestly of God. Our strength in him is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by prayer, bind him therefore with his owne promise; beseech him to do unto thee according to his good Word, he is the God of strength, desire of him the spirit of strength; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to him thy own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and in ability with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, &amp; that if he helps not, thou shalt soone be overcome: lay open thy wants in Gods presence, shew him how unable thou art of thy selfe, to

withstand temptations, to beare crosses, to performe duties, to doe or suffer any thing aright, turne his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises into pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, desire God that hee would stablish thee by his grace, that he would prop and uphold thy soule in all extremities.</p>
            <p>What is the reason that <note place="margin">Quest.</note> Christians are so daunted and flie off in time of danger?</p>
            <p>They have no faith in the promise. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">Answ.</note> is as <hi>Mount Sinah</hi> that <note place="margin">Why trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are so irksome.</note> shall not be moved, hee builds on a foundation that can never be shaken, for the heart is never drawne to any sinfull va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or frighted with any
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2552:43"/>
terrour of trouble, till faith lets goe its hold, out of God, there is nothing for the soule safely to stay it selfe upon.</p>
            <p>No marvell to see men fall that rest on a broken Reed: Alas! whatsoever is besides God, is but a creature, and can the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be other than change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? The comfort that we have in God never fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, it is an abiding last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comfort, such as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents the soule, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies all the wants and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of it, which things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath can never acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish.</p>
            <p>Wee see that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens continue, and the earth (without any other foundation) hangs in the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2552:44"/>
midst of the world by the bare word of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore well may the soule stay it selfe on <hi>that,</hi> when it hath nothing else in sight to rely upon.</p>
            <p>In this case Christians should look, 1. That their <hi>principles</hi> and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be <hi>good:</hi> And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>builded strongly</hi> upon them, for the soule is as that which it relies on; if upon empty things, it selfe becomes poore and empty; which the Devil knowing, strives to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loose our hearts from our Maker, and draw us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon false objects. Hee sees full well, that whilest our soules cleave close to God, there is no prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2552:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
against us by any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or subtilty of men or devils. The Saints in <hi>him,</hi> are bold, and undaunted in the midst of troubles and torments; Indeed the sweetest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with God is, when we are bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off from other helps; Though misery upon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery encounters us below, yet there is still succour issuing from above to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving soule; If God hath it in heaven, <hi>faith</hi> will fetch it downe, and enjoy the sweetnesse of it here. That man can never doe amisse, that hath his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancie upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, there being no communion like that of a faithfull heart with the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:2552:45"/>
It is the office of <hi>faith</hi> to quiet our soules in all distresses, for it relies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for heaven it self, and all necessary provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till we come thither; strengthen faith therefore and you strengthen all; what can daunt that soul, which in the sorest affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hath the great God for his friend? Such a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit dares bid defiance to all the powers of darknes: Sathan may for a time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, but hee can never wholly depresse a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart. True belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers can triumph over that which others are slaves unto; they can set upon spirituall conflicts, and endure fiery tryalls,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2552:45"/>
which others tremble to think of; they can put off themselves, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be nothing, so their God may appeare the greater, and dare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake or undergoe any thing for the glory of their Maker; considering they are not their owne, but have given up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto Christ, <hi>they</hi> count not their lives, or any thing that is theirs deare for <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee that stablisheth us with you, is God, who hath annointed us, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Messias</hi> signifies <hi>annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> our nature is enriched in Christ with all graces. <hi>Hee is annointed with the</hi>

               <hi>oyle of gladnesse above his fellowes,</hi> for us, that wee might have a spring of grace in our owne nature, that God and Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, and we being in the Lord Jesus, might have all our annointing of the first annointed, for <hi>of his fulnesse we receive grace for grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What are those graces which wee receive from <note place="margin">Quest.</note> Christs fulnesse?</p>
            <p>First, the grace of <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> and acceptance, for <note place="margin">Answ.</note> the same love that God beares to Christ, he beares to all his, though not in so high a degree.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Grace of <hi>sanctification</hi> answerable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to the grace of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2552:46"/>
in him; every renued work in us comes from Christ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the rich pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and prerogatives, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that issue to persons san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; wee have dignity for dignity, favour for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, gracious qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for gracious qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Christ. God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noints us all in his Sonne, As the <hi>oyntment</hi> that was powred upon <hi>Aaron,</hi> ran downe to <hi>the skirts of his garment;</hi> so the weakest Christian is stablished with grace by Christ, grace runnes from the <hi>Head</hi> to poorest member, <hi>the hem of the garment;</hi> every one that doth but touch Christ, drawes vertue and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2552:47"/>
strength from him.</p>
            <p>Why is it called here <note place="margin">Quest.</note> an <hi>annointing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because as the <hi>Holy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. was not to be applied to prophane uses, so neither are the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the spirit, God being the Author of them, to be slighted and undervalued by the Professors of them.</p>
            <p>What are the vertues of <note place="margin">Quest.</note> this <hi>oyntment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, it hath a cherishing power, it revives the droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <note place="margin">Answ.</note> soule, and cheares a fainting spirit, when men are ready to sink under the burthen of their sins: this easeth them.</p>
            <p>2. Annointing hath a strengthening power, it makes our limbs vigorous,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2552:47"/>
so doth grace fortifie the soule, nothing more. Our life is a combating life wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h Sathan, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all sorts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee need continuall <hi>annointing</hi> to make us nimble, and active in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting our enemie; Oyle hath a suppling quality, so the Spirit of God makes pliable the joynts of the soule, it supports us with hidden strength, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables us to encounter great oppositions, &amp; to be victorious through Christ over all.</p>
            <p>Grace is little in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, but it is mighty in operation, it carries the soule through difficulties, nothing can stand in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2552:48"/>
way of a gracious man, no not the <hi>Gates of Hell.</hi> The spirit of grace that is in a Christian, is stronger than he that is in the world, <hi>A graine of Mustard seed,</hi> the very least measure of true Holinesse, is stronger than the greatest measure of opposition. A Christians strength lies out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: he never overcomes by his owne power, hee can doe all things through <hi>Christ</hi> assisting him, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hee is a most impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent creature, unable to doe or suffer any thing, ready to give over at the least trouble, and sink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every pressure of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>ointment</hi> doth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2552:48"/>
exceedingly delight and refresh ourspirits; as wee see the <hi>Box</hi> in the Gospel, when it was opened, the whole House smelt of it. So grace is a wondrous sweet thing. Before wee are anointed with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, with stabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing grace, what are we but a company of nasty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable persons in the eyes of God? All things are accursed to us, and we are accursed in what ever we doe. God cannot look on us but as loathsome creatures, as the Prophet saith, <hi>I would not so much as looke on thee, if it were not for Iehoshaphats</hi> sake.</p>
            <p>That which makes a man, sweet is <hi>grace;</hi> this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2552:49"/>
makes our nature that is noisome and offensive in the nostrils of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, in it selfe, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pleasant and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. A wicked man is a vile man, an ulcerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed creature: grace is of a healing nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is: this cures our spiritual distempers, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the inner man, and making the whole frame of a Christians carriage, sweet and delectable.</p>
            <p>First to <hi>God,</hi> who loves the sent of his own grace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> wheresoever he finds it.</p>
            <p>Secondly to <hi>Angels;</hi> the conversion of sinners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them, when our custody is committed to their charge, how are they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2552:49"/>
delighted with the beauty of holinesse shining in us? The graces of God in his Saints are a Feast to them: the very name of a godly and gratious man, is as a sweet ointment every where.</p>
            <p>Holy men when they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> are read of in Stories, what a savour doe they cast in the <hi>Church:</hi> so far as a Christian is a New Creature it makes him in love with himselfe, scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be so undervalued as to defile himselfe with base services: so farre as a man is gratious, he gives himselfe to honourable imployments; being a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of grace he improves his abilities to glorious
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2552:50"/>
uses, esteeming things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low too <hi>meane for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Grace is a wondrous pleasant thing, offensive to none, but to wicked men, that have no savour of God or goodnesse, it sweetens the soule, makes it delectable for Christ &amp; his holy Spirit to lodge in, as in a <hi>Garden of spices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> A gracious man that hath subdued his corruptions, is wondrous amiable both to himselfe, and to the Communion of Saints; his heart is as fine silver, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is sweet that comes from him: grace is full of comfort to a mans own conscience, the sense of which enlargeth the soule to all holy services.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:2552:50"/>
Fourthly, an ointment hath another property, it consecrates persons to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uses? Anointed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are raised above the ordinary ranke. The gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods spirit elevate men above the condition of others with whom they live. Anointed persons are sacred persons, they are inviolable. <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and doe my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 105. 15</note> 
               <hi>no harme:</hi> we wrong the apple of Gods eye, we offer indignity to Christ himselfe, if we hurt these. Indeed nothing can hurt them, but God by his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ruling power turnes all for their good.</p>
            <p>Lastly, an ointment is a royall liquor, it will bee
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2552:51"/>
above all; so the graces of Gods Spirit where they are, will be uppermost, they will guide and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne all. As if a man have excellent parts, grace will rule these, and make them serviceable to Christ, his truth and members. If we have weaknesse and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, grace will subdue it by little and little, and never leave conflicting till it hath got the victory.</p>
            <p>What are our souls with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods anointing? Dead stinking, offensive to God, to good men, and to our selves: we cannot see with peace the visage of our owne soules: who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect seriously into his heart and life without
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2552:51"/>
horror, that hath no grace? A man that sees his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science awakened without this <hi>anointing,</hi> what is he? surely as the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the soule: it is not all the excellencies of the soule laid upon a dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or all the goodly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments that bedeckt it, can keep it from stinking and being a loathsome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, because it wants the soule to quicken and enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it to good imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: of it selfe it is but a peece of earth: all the vigor and life that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath, is communicated from the soule, they are beholding to our soules for many things. Put the richest ornaments whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2552:52"/>
upon the body, and not the Spirit of grace upon the soule (to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and refresh the same that it may appeare love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Gods sight) all is to no purpose.</p>
            <p>Likewise this <hi>anointing</hi> hath relation to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons anointed, <hi>Kings, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi> Christ is primarily anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all our grace is derived from him; hee teacheth us divine things by a Divine light. The poorest Christian in the world (whose heart is right with God) sees good things with such convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing love, that he imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them, and ill things with such a convincing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,

that he abhors them. A man that lives without God in the world, may <hi>talke,</hi> but he cannot <hi>doe;</hi> he may speak of death, but he dares not die, he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to thinke of the last tribunall, and of resigning his soule into the hands of his Maker: such an one may discourse of <hi>suffring,</hi> but when it comes to the point, his heart failes him: oh how he shrinkes when danger approacheth, what indirect courses will hee take to save his skin? how hardly is corrupt selfe brought under? how hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily doe men come off in this point, of doing and suffering for Christ, laying downe all at his feet, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2552:53"/>
resolving to be disposed of at his pleasure in every thing? Men speak much of patience, and selfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, but they do not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise them, these vertues shine not forth in their conversation, which is the shame of Religion: only a true Christian hath the right knowledge of the doing of things, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to speak a word <hi>in due season,</hi> to reprove, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish, to comfort every member in the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, hath some qualification for the good of the whole body.</p>
            <p>A faithfull man is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise spiritually anointed a <hi>Priest,</hi> to stand before God Almighty, he poures out
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2552:53"/>
his soul for himself &amp; for others, having Gods eare open at all times to his suits Every sincere Christi an is a favourite in heaven, he hath much credit there which hee improves for the welfare of the Church here below. And hee keepes himselfe as a <hi>Priest</hi> unspotted of the world: a true Christian is taught of God, and knowes the meaning of that Law of his which prohibiteth <hi>Priests</hi> so much as to touch defiled things; therefore he studies innocency, he runs not after the course of the multitude, neither is carried away with the streames of the times: he will not converse famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2552:54"/>
with those that may staine him, (but so farre as his calling leads him) lest he should therby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminate his spirit. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Priest</hi> hath his heart alwayes to the <hi>Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> that so he may offer up thankes and praise to God, and offer up himselfe a sacrifice to him; his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is to kill and slay those <hi>beasts</hi> (those lusts) that lurk in his heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Almighty.</p>
            <p>Lastly, he that is anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Spirit, is a <hi>King,</hi> in regard of his great pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, for <hi>all</hi> are ours, <hi>things present,</hi> and <hi>things to come, life and death, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,</hi> and <hi>adversity,</hi> all help us to Heaven.

God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers the evil of things, and gives a Christian a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving principle of grace, to suck sweet out of sowre, &amp; draw good out of evill. What a King is this, that even the most terrible things are at his command and work for the best un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? He conquers and brings under his greatest enemies, and feares nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death or judgement, nor the vengeance to come, knowing God in Christ to bee his reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Father, he rests assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all things else will be

               <hi>Who hath annointed us, and sealed us.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Annointing</hi> and <hi>sealing</hi> goe together, the same
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2552:55"/>
God <hi>annoints</hi> us, doth also <note place="margin">The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> 
               <hi>seale</hi> us. <hi>Both</hi> are to secure us of our happy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now Christ is the first sealed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. <hi>Him hath God the Father sealed:</hi> God hath set Christ a part from others, hath distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished him, and set a stamp upon him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> by the graces of the spirit, whereof he was richly beautified; and by many miracles, whereby he shewed that he was the Sonne of God; by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the dead: by his calling of the <hi>Gen tiles,</hi> and many other things.</p>
            <p>Christ being <hi>sealed</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he sealed all that he did for our <hi>Redemption</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:2552:56"/>
with his <hi>bloud,</hi> and hath added for the strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our <hi>faith,</hi> outward seales, the <hi>Sacraments</hi> to secure his love more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us.</p>
            <p>But in this place ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of sealing is to be understood. For here is not meant the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Christ, but the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of us that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. The same spirit that seales the Redeemer, seales the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</p>
            <p>What is the manner of <note place="margin">Quest.</note> our sealing by the spirit?</p>
            <p>Sealing we know hath <note place="margin">Answ.</note> divers uses. First of all, <hi>It</hi> 
               <note place="margin">What our sealing is, and the use of it.</note> 
               <hi>doth imprint a likenesse of him that doth seale:</hi> when the Kings Image is stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2552:56"/>
upon the wax, every thing in the wax answers to that in the seale, face to face, eye to eye, body to body. So wee are said to be <hi>sealed,</hi> when we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in our soules, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Lord Jesus, for the spirit sets the stamp of Christ upon every true Convert, there is the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ in all things to be found in him: As the Child answers the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, foot for foot, finger for finger in proportion, but not in quantity.</p>
            <p>So it is in the sealing of a beleever, there is a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the soule that is sealed by the spirit to the Lord Jesus, there is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the same
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2552:57"/>
heavenly supernaturall truthes; there is a judging of things as Christ judgeth, a loving of that which he loves, and a hating of that which hee hates, a rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to doe that which he delights in, and a griefe to commit any thing that displeaseth his Majestie; every affection of the soul is carried that way, that the affections of our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour are carried in proportion, every thing in the soule is answerable to him in its degree.</p>
            <p>There is no grace in Christ, but there is the like in every Christian in some measure: The <hi>obedience</hi> of Christ to his Father, even to the death, is to be
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2552:57"/>
found in every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. The <hi>humility</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Christ abased himselfe, it is in every renued heart. <hi>Christ</hi> works in the soule that receives him, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to <hi>himselfe.</hi> The soule that beleeve; that Christ hath loved him; and done such great things for him, is ambitious to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Christ in all his wayes. Being once in Christ, we shall delight to be transformed more and more into him. To beare the Image of the <hi>second Adam</hi> upon our breasts, to make it appeare that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ lives in us, and that wee live not to our selves, but to him that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us, to be <hi>meeke</hi> and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2552:58"/>
heavenly minded as hee was, talking and discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of spirituall things, going about doing good every where, active for God, fruitfull in holinesse, doing &amp; receiving all the good we are able, drawing others from this world to meditate of a better estate, labouring for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods Kingdome, and approving our selves to him; this is one use of sealing, to imprint a <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second use of a Seale <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is <hi>distinction;</hi> Sealing is a stamp upon one thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many, it distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth christians from others, as we shall see after.</p>
            <p>Againe, it serves for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:2552:58"/>
               <hi>appropriation;</hi> men seale those things that are their owne; Merchants we see set their stamp on those Wares which they have, or meane to have a right unto: It pleaseth God thus to condiscend unto us, by applying himselfe to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane contracts. Hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates his <hi>own,</hi> to shew that hee hath chosen and singled them out, for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to delight in.</p>
            <p>Sealing further serves to make things <hi>authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to give authority and excellencie: The <hi>Seale</hi> of the Prince, is the <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the Prince: This gives validity to things answerable to the dignity and esteeme of him that seales.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:2552:59"/>
These are the foure principall uses of <hi>sealing.</hi> And God by his spirit doth al theseto his. 1. He stamps his own Image upon us, he distinguisheth us from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, even from the great refuse of the world. God by his spirit appropriates us to himselfe, hee makes us to be his, and shewes that we are his, hee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise authorizethus, and puts an excellencie upon us, to secure us against all temptations; when wee have Gods seale on us, we stand firme in the greatest triall: who shall seperate us from the love of God? wee dare defie all objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sathan, and accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of conscience what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2552:59"/>
A man that hath Gods seale, stands im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable in the most tempestuous season. For it is given for <hi>our</hi> assu rance, and not for Gods, the Lord knowes who are <hi>his,</hi> hee seales not because he is ignorant, but for our comfort and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Whether is the <hi>spirit</hi> it selfe this seale, or the <hi>work</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Quest.</note> 
               <hi>of the spirit,</hi> and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof wrought in us?</p>
            <p>I answer, the Spirit of <note place="margin">Answ.</note> God where it is, is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient seale that God hath set us out for himselfe, for <hi>whosoever hath the Spirit of Christ, the same is his.</hi> He is the Author of our
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2552:60"/>
sealing, so that except you take the <hi>Spirit</hi> for that which is wrought by the Spirit, you have not the comprehension of sealing, for, <hi>that which the Spirit worketh, is the seale;</hi> the spirit goes alwayes with his owne mark and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; Other seales when they are removed from the stamp, the stamp remaines still; but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God dwells, and keepes a perpetuall resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the heart of a Christian, guiding him, moving him, enlightning him, governing him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting him, doing all offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a seale in his heart, till hee hath brought him to heaven. The Holy
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2552:60"/>
Ghost never leaves us, it is the sweetest inhabitant that ever lodging was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to; he doth all the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good that is done to the soule, and is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with his own work in joy and comfort; though he seeme sometimes to be in a corner of the heart, and is not easily discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet he alwayes dwels in his sealed ones.</p>
            <p>What is that stamp, that <note place="margin">Quest.</note> the Spirit seales us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?</p>
            <p>The Spirit works in this <note place="margin">Answ.</note> order for the most part; First of all, the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth together with the <hi>Word</hi> (which is the instrument, and the Chariot wherein it is carried) convince us
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2552:61"/>
of the ill that is in us, and the misery attending on us for the same. It convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us of <hi>sinne,</hi> and the fearefull estate we are in by that, and abaseth us thereupon, therefore it is called the <hi>Spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> because it makes a man tremble and quake, till he see his peace made up in Christ.</p>
            <p>When hee hath done this, then he convinceth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> us of <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> by a sweet light discovering the excellencies of the Lord Jesus, and the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in him provided for sinners. God opens the eye of the soul, to see the all-sufficiency of his Sons sanct<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fication, and inclines
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2552:61"/>
the heart to cast it selfe by faith upon him.</p>
            <p>When we are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> convinced of the <hi>ill</hi> that is in us, and of the good that is in Christ, and are moved by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> to go out of our selves and imbrace reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Lord Jesus, then a superadded worke is vouchsafed unto us; for the Spirit daily perfecteth his owne work; he addes therefore after all, his <hi>Seale,</hi> to confirme us; which <hi>Seale</hi> is not <hi>faith:</hi> for the Apostle saith, <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>you beleeved, you were sealed,</hi> where we see the work of <hi>faith</hi> and sealing distinguished: first the soul is set in a good estate, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2552:62"/>
then followes assurance and stablishment.</p>
            <p>But what needs confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation when we <hi>beleeve?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Is not <hi>faith</hi> confirmation enough? when a man may know by a private reflect act of the soule, that he is in the state of grace?</p>
            <p>This act of ours in <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Quest.</note> is oft terribly shaken; and God is wondrous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous that we should bee secure of his love; hee knowes hee can have no glory, nor we any solid peace else: therfore when we by <hi>faith</hi> have sealed to his truth, he sees that wee need further sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that our faith be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and good; for all is little enough in the time
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2552:62"/>
of temptation, the single witnesse of our soul is not strong enough in great as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults. For sometimes the Spirit is so tossed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with temptations, that we cannot reflect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right on our selves, nor discerne what is in our own brests without much adoe; therefore God first workes <hi>faith</hi> to apply the promise, <hi>Whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves in Christ shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> I beleeve in Christ, therefore I shall be saved, and then sealeth this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe with an addition of his holy Spirit; for this sealing is a work upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, an honouring of <hi>faith</hi> with a superadded confirmation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:2552:63"/>
How shall wee know <note place="margin">Quest.</note> that there is such a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sealing in us?</p>
            <p>I answer, when we truly <note place="margin">Answ.</note> beleeve, the <hi>Spirit of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option,</hi> reveales unto us that we are the sonnes of God, by a secret whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and intimation to the soule, (which the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heart feeles better than I am able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse) saying, <hi>be of good comfort, thy sins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> there is a sweet kisse, vouchsafed to the soule: the Lord refresheth it with the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and assures it, that all enmity is now slaine: I am thy salvation, thou art for ever mine, and I am thine; because thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2552:63"/>
behold thou art ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured to be my child.</p>
            <p>Againe the <hi>Spirit of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> quickens and fils the soule with heavenly ejaculations to God, it stirs up servent supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to cry <hi>Abba Father.</hi> The soule when it truly beleeves, hath a bold and familiar speech to God.</p>
            <p>There are two things in the prayer of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that are incompetible with a carnall man: there is first an inward <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and secondly, an <hi>carnestnesse</hi> in the soule, whereby he goes to God as a Child to his loving <hi>Father,</hi> not considering his owne worthinesse or meanes, but the constant
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2552:64"/>
love that is bore to him.</p>
            <p>This spirituall speech of God to the soule, and of the soule to God, is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident demonstration of our truth in grace, because we can do that which no Hypocrite in the world can attaine to.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this sealing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Spirit after wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, is knowne by the worke of Sanctification which it effecteth in us; the holy Spirit <hi>seales</hi> our spirits, by stamping the likenesse of Christ upon us; so as when a man finds in his soule, some linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the heavenly I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, he may know ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that hee is <hi>translated from death to life;</hi> when
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2552:64"/>
he finds his heart subdued to humility and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to such a holy and gratious frame as Christs was; he may cleerely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne that he hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the <hi>Old man</hi> in him: when a man can say, naturally I am proud, but now I can abase my selfe; naturally, I am full of malice, now I can love, and pray heartily for my enemies; naturally I am lumpish &amp; dead-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, now I can joy in the Holy Ghost; naturally, I am apt to distrust the Lord, and be disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with my condition, now I can rest securely upon his <hi>Promise</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:</hi> sin hath been my
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2552:65"/>
delight, now it is my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and heart-breaking, I finde somewhat contrary to corruption in me. I carry the <hi>Image of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam</hi> about me now: I say, whosoever hath this blessed change, may rest assured of his right to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse. <hi>Know you not that Christ is in you, except you be reprobates,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle. A Christian that upon a through search finds something of Christ alwayes in his soule, can never want a sweet evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he is sealed <hi>to the day of redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth way is by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the <hi>joy</hi> of the Spirit, which is the beginning of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as it were, and a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2552:65"/>
of glory before our time; there are few of Gods children, but in the cours of their pilgrimage, first or last, have this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine impression wrought in them, enlarging and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing their soules to joy in the Almighty.</p>
            <p>Yet this is especially seene after conflict, when the soule hath combated with some strong corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or temptation, <hi>To him that overcomes wll I give of the hidden Mannah,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>and a white stone which none can reade but he that hath it,</hi> that is, hee shall have assurance that he is in the state of grace, and the sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of goodnesse it selfe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2552:66"/>
shall be his portion; usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God gives comfort af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wee have conflicted with some sinfull disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and have got the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, as we see in <hi>Iob,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>God</hi> had exercised that Champion a long time, at the last hee discovered himself in a glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to him.</p>
            <p>In the midst of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when a Christian is under great crosses, and God sees hee must bee supported with spirituall strength, or else he sinks, then he puts in with sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from above: when the creature cannot help us, the Creator of all things will. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> in the midst of the <hi>Dungeon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2552:66"/>
sealed with the Spirit, <hi>sang at midnight</hi> when he was in the <hi>Stocks:</hi> and so <hi>David</hi> in the midst of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution: Daniel</hi> in a Lions Den: the <hi>three Children</hi> in the fiery furnace, &amp;c. God doth as Parents, smile on their little ones when they are sick and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: hee reserves his choisest comforts for the greatest exigents: when God hath a great worke for his children to doe, or some sharpe suffering for them to undergoe, as an incouragement before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, hee oft enlargeth their spirits that they may be able to go through all. As our Saviour Christ had <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> with
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2552:67"/>

            <p>Let us then examine our selves by that which hath beene delivered: hath God spoken to thy soule and said, I am thy salvation, thy sinnes are remitted, and thy person received into my favour: doth God stirre up thy spirit to call upon him, (especially in extremity) and to go with boldnesse and earrestnesse to his Throne? Surely this is an evidence of the <hi>seale</hi> of the Spirit, for who ever wants this, cannot look God in the face, when distresse is upon him: <hi>Saul</hi> in this case goes to the <hi>Witch,</hi> and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2552:67"/>
               <hi>Achitophel</hi> to desperate conclusions: <hi>Iudas</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, we see what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of him? So every one that hath not this sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Spirit, (to whom God speakes not peace by shedding abroad the love of Christ in his heart) must needs sinck as Lead in the bottome of the Sea, which hath no consistence, till it come to the <hi>Center,</hi> to Hell. Did you ever feele the joy of the Spirit in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties, after inward striving against your lusts, and getting ground of them; this is a certaine signe that God hath sealed you.</p>
            <p>But you will say, How <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:2552:68"/>
can that be a <hi>seale?</hi> A seale <note place="margin">Quest.</note> continues with the thing, but the joy of the Spirit comes after the work of the Spirit, and abides not with us?</p>
            <p>I answer, though wee <note place="margin">Answ.</note> have not alwayes the joy of the Spirit, yet we have the <hi>Spirit</hi> of joy, which though it be not knowne by joy, yet may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by its operation and working. A Christian may have a gracious work of the Spirit in him, and yet want the delight and joy of the Spirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when that failes, look to thy sanctification, and see what resemblance of Christ is formed in thee.

and broken, if thou have a heavenly dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like to thy Saviour; when the <hi>joy</hi> of the Spirit ceaseth, goe to the work of the Spirit, and from the work of the Spirit, to the <hi>voyce</hi> of the Spirit; Canst thou cry to God with strong supplications? or if thou canst not pray with distinct words, canst thou mourne and groane? <hi>The Spirit helps our infirmities, when wee know not what to ask.</hi> This sighing &amp; groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is the voyce of Gods Spirit, which hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard wheresoever he finds it.

            <p>If one be in the midst
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2552:69"/>
of extremity, and can se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously seek to God, it is an undoubted signe that such a one is sealed, especially when the corruption of his soule joynes with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans temptations the more to afflict him; for a sinner in the midst of stormes &amp; clouds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then to cast anchor, and quiet his soule in Christ, argues great <hi>faith:</hi> So when a temptation closes with our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and affliction yeelds ground to further the temptation, then to pray and rely securely upon God, is a gracious signe; for Sathan useth the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we are in, as temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to shake our faith;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2552:69"/>
as thus, Canst thou be a child of God, and be so exercised? so vilified, so persecuted? Didst thou belong to Christ, would ever these crosses, &amp; losses, and miseries have befallen thee? deceive not thy selfe: Thus affliction is a weapon to temptation, for Sathan to help his fiery darts with, he having such a dangerous party in us (as our own corruption) doth us the more harme conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</p>
            <p>How shall a man know <note place="margin">Quest.</note> whether God hath a part in him?</p>
            <p>I answer. If he can run <note place="margin">Answ.</note> against the streame; if he find his soule resisting Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans temptations, &amp; rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

               <hi>David</hi> found inward corruptions, and outward afflictions joyning with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans temptations, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his spirit, hereupon he chides his owne soule. <hi>Why is it thus with thee, why art thou dejected in this manner?</hi> and then he layes a charge upon it, <hi>Trust in God.</hi> Whatsoever hardship wee meet with in the world, yet there is

hope in God still; though we can find little comfort below, yet there are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of consolation above; it argues a gracious heart to quiet ones selfe in God in the worst times.</p>
            <p>I beseech you let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have our soules <note place="margin">Vse.</note> sealed with the Spirit of God, to have further and clearer evidence of our estate in grace; it is a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thing to have Christ live in us, the enemies of our salvation are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, and how soone death or judgement may ceaze us, wee know not, God will set none at his right hand, but his Sheep, those that have his owne Image on them; his best

            <p>How comfortably will the soule commend it self to Christ, when it finds it selfe stamped with the Spirit of Christ? when he can chearefully say, Lord Jesus receive my soule; thou that hast redeemed me by thy bloud, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me by thy Spirit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thine owne likenesse in me, though it be not as it should be, yet there is somwhat of thine in me.</p>
            <p>Beloved, wee must not give false evidence of our selves, as wee must not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2552:71"/>
against others; what a comfort hath a sealed soul in the houre of death, and in all extremities? what a difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene such a soule, and others in the time of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as in the time of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, warre, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution for Christ? The soul that is sealed knowes that hee is marked out for happinesse in the world to come. Whatsoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls him in this life, hee knowes that God in all confusion of times knows his own <hi>Seale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and that his <hi>destroying Angell</hi> shal spare and passe over those that are marked, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9. And though our bodies escape not, yet our soules shall.</p>

               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:2552:72"/>
               <hi>Iosias</hi> wee see was taken away from the evill to come, and <hi>Lot</hi> was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the judgement of the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> If wee partake not of the sinnes of the wicked, wee shall never partake of their plagues; God hath a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care of his <hi>little ones</hi> in this life, and if hee take them away, yet their <hi>death</hi> is <hi>pretious in his sight;</hi> hee <note place="margin">Psal. 116.</note> will not part with them but upon speciall conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: he sees if they live it will be worse for them, their pretious soules are in continuall danger; hee sees it is best for them to be gathered to God, and the soules of perfect ones in heaven, therefore hee
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2552:72"/>
provides a shelter to free them from all stormes on earth.</p>
            <p>And as hee hath an eye over them in regard of outward miseries; so in respect of spirituall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and infection; as <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. Gods holy ones were <hi>sealed,</hi> so many of such a <hi>Tribe,</hi> and so many of such a <hi>Tribe,</hi> to signifie, that God hath alwayes some that hee will keepe and preserve from the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous contagion of sinne, and Antichrist; even in evill times God hath his <hi>little flock</hi> still.</p>
            <p>In the obscure ages of the Church, 900 yeares after Christ, when there was little learning and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2552:73"/>
goodnesse in the world, and <hi>Egyptian</hi> darknes had over-spred the earth. God had alwayes sealed ones, marked out for himselfe, whom he preserved from the danger of dark times; why then should wee be afraid of evill tidings? Let any affliction or death it selfe come, Christ will know his own stamp in us, he hath a book of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, for those that are his, and when hee gathers his jewells, they will bee highly set by. God in common calamities suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his luggage, (wicked men) to goe to wrack, but he will secure his jewels, his darlings, what ever come of it; labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2552:73"/>
to bee a sealed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>But you will say, what <note place="margin">Quest.</note> shall I account of my self, if there bee but a little signe of grace in me?</p>
            <p>Be not discouraged, you <note place="margin">Answ.</note> know in wax, though the stamp be almost out, yet it is currant in Law not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding. Put the case the stamp of the <hi>Prince</hi> be an old Coyne, is it not currant though it bee crackt? Suppose the mark of the Spirit, should bee dim and blurred, scarce discernable in us, (this ought to bee our shame and griefe) yet some evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of grace are still remaining; there are some sighes and groanes against
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2552:74"/>
corruption, which may continually support us: if we mourne in our spirits, and doe not joyne with our lusts, nor allow our selves in them, this is a divine impression, though it bee (as it were) almost worne out: the more comfort wee desire, the fresher she should keepe this seale of comfort.</p>
            <p>And labour to grow in faith and obedience, that we may reade our evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence cleerely, that it be not over-growne with the dust of the world, so as we cannot see it. Sometimes Gods children have the graces of the Spirit in them, yet they yeeld so much to feares and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2552:74"/>
that they can read nothing but their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When we bid them puruse their evidences, they can see nothing but <hi>worldlinesse,</hi> nothing but <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>envie,</hi> because they grieve the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by their negligence and distrust. Though there be a stamp in them, yet God holds the soule from it, and gives men up to mistake their estates, for not stirring up the graces of his Spirit in them.</p>
            <p>Honour God by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and he will honour thee by stamping his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit more cleerely on thee, what a comfort is it to have the evidence of a gratious soule at all times.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2552:75"/>
When a man carries about him the marke of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, what in the world can discourage such a soule? On the contrary, if a man have not something above nature in him, when death &amp; judgement comes, how miserable is his condition? If a man be a King or an Emperour of the World, and have not an interest in Christs righteousnesse, ere long he shall be strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all, and adjudged to eternall torments. Oh the excellency of mans soule, a Jewell more to be prized then a Princes Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</p>
            <p>It is the solly of the times to set up curious Pictures, but what a poore
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2552:75"/>
delight is this in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the ambition of a true Christian, to see the Image of Christ stamped in his soule, to finde the joy of the Spirit, and God speaking peace to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man.</p>
            <p>The transforming of our selves into the image of Christ, is the best Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in the world; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should labour for the new creature, that as we grow downeward one way, we may grow up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven another; that as the life of nature decayes, so the spirituall life may bee more active and working. It should be our daily study while we live in this world to attain
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2552:76"/>
that <hi>holinesse, without which no man shall ever see God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is besides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon broad Seale of God, his privie Seal. What is the reason that many proud hearted persons are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? the truth is, they are all for externall content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and despise the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of GOD: for though they stand upon their admission into the Church, upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon seales and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives (which in themselves are excellent) yet relying on these things overmuch betrayes many soules to the Devill in the time of distresse. It is an other manner of seale than the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2552:76"/>
outward seale in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that must settle peace in the conscience. When once the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of faith are wrought in us, then wee may with comfort thinke upon our receiving of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but the speciall thing to be eyed, is the hidden seale. If the externall meanes work no inward sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our hearts, we shall be the worse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the better for them: yet we must not be so prophane as to think slightly of Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they are of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.</p>
            <p>For when Satan shakes the confidence of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and saith, Thou art
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2552:77"/>
an Hypocrite, God doth not love thee; <hi>these</hi> help us to hold out: why saith the soule, I can speak by experience that I have found the contrary; the Lord hath removed my feares, he hath pardoned my sinne and accepted my person, he hath given me many <hi>Pretious Promises</hi> to support my spirit. Here is the excellency of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> it comes more home to me, it seales the generall Promises of God particularly to my selfe: for finding the inward worke of the Spirit in my heart, and God having strengthned my faith by the outward seale, I can defie Satan with all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2552:77"/>
and look death in the face with comfort. We should labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to observe Gods sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling dayes, when he uses to manifest himselfe to his people; which though it may be every day (if wee be spiritually exercised) yet it is in the Lords day more especially, for then his ordinance and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit go together.</p>
            <p>Now there is a sealing of <hi>persons,</hi> and of <hi>truths,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the sealing of our <hi>estates,</hi> that we are the children of God; there is a sealing of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar truth to a Christian. For where there is grace to beleeve the truth, God seales those truths firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2552:78"/>
to that soule by the comforts of his Spirit. For example, this is a truth, <hi>Whosoever beleeves in Christ, shall not perish but have everlasting life.</hi> Now the same Spirit that stirs up the soule to beleeve this, seales it fast upon the conscience even to death; there is no promise, but upon our beleeving the same, it is sealed by God upon us: for those truths only abide firme in the soule which the Holy Ghost sets on. What is the reason that many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their consolations, the reason is they heare much but the Spirit settles no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on their hearts.</p>
            <p>What is the reason that <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:2552:78"/>
lettered men many times stand out in their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to blood, whereas those that are more able and learned, yeeld to any thing. The reason is, the <note place="margin">Answ.</note> knowledge of the one is set fast upon the <hi>soule;</hi> the Spirit brings his seale and this mans <hi>knowledge</hi> close together: whereas the learning and abilities of the other, is only a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursive thing swimming in the braine without any sollid foundation; their knowledge of truths is not spiritual: they see not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things by heavenly, but by a naturall light. Those that would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatize, must have a knowledge sutable to the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2552:79"/>
things they know; they must see spirituall things by the Spirit of GOD. Therefore when we come to heare the Word, wee should not come with strong conceits of our owne, to bring all to our wits, but with reverent dispositions and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, that he would teach us together with his Ministers, and close with his Ordinances so as to fasten truths upon our soules, else shall wee never hold out: for that which must stablish and quiet the soule, must bee greater than the soule.</p>
            <p>In time of tentations when the terrours of the Almighty encompasse us,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2552:79"/>
when God layes open our conscience, and writes bitter things against us, those truths that most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the soule at such a time, must be above the naturall capacity of the soule, therefore saith the Apostle, <hi>It is God that establishes,</hi> and God by his Spirit that seales us up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the day of redemption, because divine truths of themselves in the bare letter, cannot stirre up the heart; it is only the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirit, which is above our spirits, that must qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et the conscience in all perplexities; the Lord can soone still the soule when he settles spirituall truths upon it: therefore go to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2552:80"/>
him in thy distresse and trouble of minde; send up ejaculations to God, that hee would seale the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort revealed in his word to thy soule, that as it is true in it selfe, so it may be true to thee likewise.</p>
            <p>This is a necessary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation for us all. Oh we desire in the houre of death to finde some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, that bee standing comforts, that may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold us against Hell and judgement. Know that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will do this but spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall truths spiritually knowne, but holy truths set on by the Holy Ghost upon the soule. Oft ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enter into thine heart and examine upon what
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2552:80"/>
grounds and motives thou beleevest; Consider well what it is thou beleevest, and upon what evidences, and withwhat light, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise expect not to find sollid peace.</p>
            <p>What course may a Christian generally take <note place="margin">Quest.</note> when hee wants comfort and inward refreshing.</p>
            <p>There are in 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. <note place="margin">Answ.</note> three witnesses <hi>in heaven,</hi> &amp; three <hi>in earth,</hi> to secure <note place="margin">In want of comfort what is to be done.</note> us of our estate in grace: The three witnesses in heaven are, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> And the three witnesses in earth are, the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>Bloud:</hi> and these three on earth, and those three in heaven
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2552:81"/>
agree in one. Now by the Spirit here is meant the feelings and sweet moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, the water may well be the Laver of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> &amp; by bloud is understood the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ for our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</p>
            <p>When therefore wee find that extraordinarie seale I spake of before (the joyes of the Spirit of God) that it is not in us. What shall we doe? shall wee despaire then? No, then goe to the water; when the witnesse of the Spirit is silent, goe to the work of the Spirit, see what gracious dispositions are found in thee.</p>
            <p>I, but what shall we do <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:2552:81"/>
if the waters be troubled in the soule, as some times there is such a confusion, that we cannot see the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God upon it in sanctification.</p>
            <p>Then goe to the <hi>bloud,</hi> there is alwayes comfort; <note place="margin">Answ.</note> goe to the <hi>fountaine set open for Iudah and Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem to wash in,</hi> that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dry. If we find much sinne upon our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and no peace in our hearts; apply the bloud of sprinkling, that will give rest.</p>
            <p>When thou findest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but corruption and filthinesse in thy soule, when thou seest neither <hi>joy</hi> nor <hi>sanctification</hi> of Spirit, goe to the Lord
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2552:82"/>
Jesus, and hee will purge thee from all guilt, and wash thee with clean wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But to goe on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who hath sealed us, and given us the <hi>earnest</hi> of his Spirit in our hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the third word, borrowed from humane Contracts, to set forth Gods gracious work in the soule: <hi>Annointing</hi> wee had before &amp; <hi>sealing;</hi> now here is <hi>earnest.</hi> The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of expression shewes, there is a great remainder of unbeliefe in the soule of man, which causeth the blessed Spirit to use so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words to manifest Gods mind, and assure the soule
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2552:82"/>
of salvation, stablishing, annointing, sealing, and earnest.</p>
            <p>And indeed so it is, howsoever we in the time of prosperity (when all things goe well with us) are apt to presume our estate is good, yet in the houre of death when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is awaked, we are prone to nothing so much as to call all in question, and beleeve the lies and doubts and feares of our owne deceitfull hearts, more than the undoubted truth and promise of God. Therefore the Lord takes all courses to establish us, he gives us rich and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promises, hee gives us the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2552:83"/>
us in those promises, he <hi>seales</hi> us with that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and gives us a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable <hi>earnest</hi> thereof, and all to settle these wretched &amp; unbeleeving hearts of ours. So desirous is God that wee should be well conceited of him, that hee loves us better than wee love our selves; Hee prizeth our love so much, that he labours by all meanes to secure us of our eternall welfare; as knowing, that except we apprehend his love to us, wee can never love him againe, nor delight in him as we ought to doe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> the Spirit is an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of our inheritance in heaven, wee are sonnes
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2552:83"/>
here indeed; but wee are not heires invested into the blessed estate we have title to; God doth notkeep all our happinesse till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, but gives us somewhat to comfort us in our absence from our husband; hee gives us the Holy Ghost in our hearts, as a pledge of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous condition, which wee shall one day have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with him; this is the meaning of the words.</p>
            <p>But to shew you more particularly, In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Spirit is called an <hi>earnest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First of all, you know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> an earnest is used, for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity <note place="margin">Why the Spirit is called an earnest.</note> of a Contract. So the holy Spirit doth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2552:84"/>
us of the blessed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, we shall have in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, an earnest is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> part of the bargaine, a part of the whole which is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, though it be a very little part, yet it is a part; So it is with the Spirit of God, in its gracious work upon our hearts, the joy of the Spirit is a part of that full joy and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which shall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed hereafter to us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, an earnest is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> little in comparison of the whole; So the Spirit in the work and graces ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is little in regard of that fulnesse which wee shall have in heaven; But though an earnest be smal
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2552:84"/>
in it selfe, yet it is great in security; A shilling se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a bargaine of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound we see; Wee value an earnest not for its owne worth, so much as (for that which it is a pledge of) for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent bargaine and rich pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session which it doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest us unto: So the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God with its blessed effects in the soule, the joy and peace of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, chearing and reviving perplexed sinners; this earnest, I say, though it be little in it selfe, yet it is great to us in respect of the assurance that we have by it.</p>
            <p>Againe, it hath the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> terme of an <hi>earnest,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2552:85"/>
an arnest is given rather for the security of the party that receives it, than in regard of him that gives it; So God gives us the <hi>earnest of his Spirit,</hi> grace and comfort in this life, not so much for <hi>God,</hi> for hee meanes to give us heaven and happinesse, when wee are dissolved: As he hath passed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, so hee will undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly performe the same; Hee is Lord and Master of his word, Hee is Jehovah that gives a being to his word, as well as to every other thing: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing having to doe with mistrustfull, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving men, hee is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to condiscend to our
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2552:85"/>
weaknesse, hee stoops to the lowest capacity, and frames his speech to the understanding of the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest soule; for which purpose this terme of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest is here borrowed.</p>
            <p>In these respects the Spirit of God together with the graces of it, and the comforts it brings (for they are not divided) is called an <hi>earnest.</hi> And thus having cleared the point, we will observe this doctrine for our further instruction.</p>
            <p>That a Christian ought to be, and may be assured of his interest in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as I said before) an earnest is given not so much for Gods sake, as for
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2552:86"/>
our sakes; this then must needs follow from hence, Either none have this <hi>earnest,</hi> or else those that have it, may be assured of their comfortable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Otherwise God is fickle, and playes fast and loose with his children, which is blasphemy to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme. Besides, if none have this <hi>earnest,</hi> then the Apostle speaks false, when he saith, <hi>God hath stablished us, and given us the earnest of his Spirit,</hi> which is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible impiety once to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            <p>If this be so, then either <note place="margin">Quest.</note> such as have this seale and earnest of the Spirit, may be assured of their estate in grace or not; And if
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2552:86"/>
not, where is the fault? Will not God really and truly vouchsafe unto his people this earnest of the Spirit in their hearts? Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <note place="margin">Answ.</note> he will, he is <note place="margin">God meanes truly in giving his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.</note> desirous that wee should be perswaded of his love in all things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may and ought to bee assured of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards us: S. <hi>Iohns</hi> whole Epistle containes little else, but sundry markes &amp; evidences how we may know that wee are the children of God: wherefore was Christ himselfe sealed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour? wherefore did he die and rise againe? and wherefore doth hee
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2552:87"/>
still make intercession for us in Heaven? that wee should doubt of Gods love? (when as he hath given us that which is greater than salvation, yea greater than al the world, even his owne Sonne.) no certainly; can we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire a more ample testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his favour, than he hath already bestowed upon us? Is it not the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand of all Gods mercies to bring us neerer to him selfe? that we should not doubt of his love, but rest securely upon him: why then doe we distrust the Almighty, who is truth it selfe, and never failed any?</p>
            <p>Yet we must know that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:2552:87"/>
Christians have not at all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> times alike assurance of <note place="margin">Assurance of our estates not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</note> their interest, for there is an <hi>infancy</hi> of grace, where in we are ignorant of our own condition. And there is a time of <hi>desertion,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when as God to make us looke better to our foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leaves us a little, as if he would forsake us quite, when indeed hee onely withdrawes his assistance for a while to make us cleave the closer to him. There be also certain sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, wherin though we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> are assured of Gods favor, yet we have no feeling or apprehension of the same which differeth in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians much, according as they are more or lesse sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2552:88"/>
of their estates. Some againe use not that care and diligence in the use of meanes which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, whereupon they are justly deprived of that inward peace and comfort which others enjoy. There is a difference like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in growth and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in Christianity, some are strong Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and some weak, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable whereunto is the difference of assurance of Gods love usually in the hearts of his people. Nay, its possible that for a long time, the Lords <hi>Iewels</hi> (his redeemed ones) may want this blessed comfort. <note place="margin">A double act of faith to work assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For wee must conceive there is a double act of faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:2552:88"/>
First, an act, whereby a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> poore distressed sinner casts himselfe upon God as reconciled to him in Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> act, whereby <hi>knowing</hi> that wee rely upon the truth and promise of the Almighty, we have assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his favour. Now a man may performe the one act, and not the other: many of the Saints some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times can hardly say that they have any assurance, but yet notwithstanding, they will daily cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and free grace of God in Jesus Christ. <note place="margin">Things hindring our assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, there are many things which may hinder
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2552:89"/>
this act of assurance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (together with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving) God may present such things to my minde as may so damp and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet my soule, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have any definitive thoughts, about that which God would especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have mee to thinke upon.</p>
            <p>As when God will hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a man, he takes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Spirit of <hi>faith</hi> wholly from him, but sets before such a sinfull crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his anger and sore displeasure, together with the hellish torments and paines of the damned, as due to his soule; which makes him for the present to be in an estate little dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fering 
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2552:89"/>
from the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: so that he is far from saying, he hath any assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at that time: yet notwithstanding he doth not leave off nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his confidence, but casts himselfe upon Gods mercy still; <hi>Though the Lord kill him, yet will he trust in him,</hi> although he sees nothing but terror &amp; wrath before him. This <hi>God</hi> doth to tame our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and prepare us for the enjoyment of his future glory. If we feele not <hi>sense</hi> of assurance, it is good to blesse God for what we have. Wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not denie but God offers himselfe in mercy to us, and that hee intends our
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2552:90"/>
good thereby: for so we ought to construe his mercifull dealing towards us, and not have him in jealousie without ground. Had wee but willing hearts to praise God, for that which we cannot but acknowledge comes from him, he will bee ready in his time to shew himself more cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us. We taste of his goodnesse many wayes, &amp; it is accompanied with much patience: and these in their natures should leade us, not only to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> but to neerer <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance</hi> on him: we ought to follow that which <hi>God</hi> leads us unto, though he hath not yet acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2552:90"/>
us with his secrets.</p>
            <p>These things we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that we give not a false evidence against our selves, though wee have not such assurance as wee have had, yet alwayes there is some ground in us whereupon we may bee comforted, that wee are Gods children, could we but search into it. Let us not then be negligent in labouring for the same, and in the Lords good time we shall certainly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it: it is the prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the world that they improve not those helpes which God hath afforded for this purpose.</p>
            <p>Nay they had rather stagger and take content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2552:91"/>
in their own wayes, saying; If God will love mee in a loose licentious course, so it is, but I will not give diligence to make my calling and election sure: I will never barre my selfe of such profits and delights, nor forsake all, chiefly to minde spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things.</p>
            <p>Whereas wee ought constantly to endeavour for assurance of grace, that God may have honour from us, and we the more comfort from him againe; that we may live in the world above the world, and passe cheerefully through the manifold troubles and temptations which hefail us in our pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:2552:91"/>
A man in his pure natu rals will swell against this doctrine, because he feeles no such thing, and thinks what is above his measure, is hypocrisie. He makes himselfe the rule of other Christians to walke by, and therefore values and esteemes others by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine condition: but the heart of a Christian hath a light in it, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in his soule makes him discerne what estate he is in.</p>
            <p>In a naturall man all is dark, hee sees nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his heart is in a Dungeon, his <hi>eye</hi> being dark, the <hi>whole man</hi> must needs be in blindnesse. All is alike to him, he sees no
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2552:92"/>
difference betweene flesh and spirit, and therefore holds on in a doubting hope; in a confused dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and temper of soule to his dying-day.</p>
            <p>But a Christian that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to walk in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the holy Ghost, cannot rest in such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled estate; he dares not venture his eternall wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare upon such infirme grounds: What? to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part this life, and be tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in uncertainty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man goes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or to Hell! What a miserable perplexity must such a soule needs be in? Therefore he is still <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his salvation,</hi> and storing up of grace against the evill day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:2552:92"/>
And well may this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition challenge all our diligence in labouring for it: because it is neither at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained nor maintained without the strength and <note place="margin">Sense of Gods love how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</note> prime of our care, for the sense of Gods favour will not bee kept, without keeping him in our best affections, above all things else in the world besides; without keeping of our hearts constantly close and neere to him, which can never bee done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out keeping a most nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row watch over our loose spirits, which are ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to stray from him, and fall to the creature.</p>
            <p>It cannot be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exact walking, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2552:93"/>
selfe-deniall. But what of that? Can wee spend our labours to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purpose? One sweet beame of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance will requite all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly. A Christian indeed undergoes more trouble and paines (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with his own heart) than others do, but what is that to his gaines? One day spent in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, is sweeter than a thousand without it. What comforts so great as those that are fetched from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine? Oh woe to him that savours not these <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,</hi> but lingers after <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> comforts. It cannot but grieve the holy Spirit,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2552:93"/>
when the <hi>consolations</hi> of the Almighty are either <hi>forgotten,</hi> or seem <hi>nothing</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>But why doth the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Quest.</note> thus <hi>establish</hi> and <hi>seale</hi> us, and conveigh grace to our soules? why doth that doe all?</p>
            <p>Because since the fall <note place="margin">Answ.</note> we have no principles of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> supernaturall good in us; and there must be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple above nature to work grace in our barren hearts.</p>
            <p>Againe there is still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in us an utter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versnesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to that which is spiritually good in the best, therefore there must bee somewhat to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power their corrupt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:2552:94"/>
But why the <hi>Spirit</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Quest.</note> than the <hi>Father</hi> or the <hi>Sonne?</hi> Hee comes from both, and therefore is fit to witnesse the love of both; the Holy Ghost is in the breast of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi> hee knowes their secret affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards us. A mans spirit is acquainted with his in most thoughts: the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirit is privie to the hidden love of God, and of Jesus Christ to us poore creatures, which we are strangers unto, therefore none so fit to cheere and revive us.</p>
            <p>Indeed the love origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally is from the <hi>Father,</hi> but in regard of applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what is wrought by
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2552:94"/>
the <hi>Sonne,</hi> all proceeds from the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> he receives grace from Christ for us. It must needs be so, because no lesse than the Spirit of God can qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et our perplexed spirits in time of tentation. For when the conscience of a guilty person is affrighted, what man can allay its feares? That which must settle a troubled spirit, must be a spirit above our owne. It being no easie thing to bring the soule and God together after peace is broken: we have both wind and tide against us in this businesse, grace being but weak, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption strong in the best of us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:2552:95"/>
We should labour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for heavenly spirits, &amp; get somthing more than a man in us. There can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be any true peace at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, till the Spirit from above settle it in our souls. An unsanctified heart is an unpacified heart. If there be a neglect of holinesse, the soule can never bee soundlyquiet; where there is not a cleare conscience, there cannot be a calm co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that is a generall rule. Sinne like <hi>Ionas</hi> in the ship will raise conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall stormes both within and without a man. Take away <hi>God</hi> once, and fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well all true tranquillity. Spirituall comforts flow immediatly from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2552:95"/>
of Comfort, who hath his office designed for that purpose.</p>
            <p>But how shall we know <note place="margin">Quest.</note> that we have the <hi>Spirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How may a man know <note place="margin">Answ.</note> that hee hath a soule? by living and moving, by acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vitall, &amp;c. Even so may a man know hee hath the Spirit of God by its bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed effects and operations: it is not idle in us, but as the soule quickens the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, so doth the Spirit the soule. Every saving grace is a signe that the Spirit is in us. Wheresoever the Spirit dwells, hee trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes the soule, &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the party (like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) to be holy, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, this is an undoubted
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2552:96"/>
symptome of the Spirits habitation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all spirituall graces are with conflict, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for that which is true, is with a great deale of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of that which is counterfeit; <hi>the flesh</hi> still lusts against <hi>the spirit,</hi> and Satan cannot endure to see any man walk co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to heaven. What, thinks hee, such a base creature as this is to have the earnest of salvation, to live here as if hee were in heaven already, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all opposite powers; sure hee shall have little peace this way, I will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and vex his spirit; if he will goe to heaven, hee shall go mourning thither.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:2552:96"/>
This is the reasoning of the cursed spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hee labours to shake our assurance, and follow us with perplexities. The grace and comfort of a Christian, is with much conflict and tentations, not only with Satan, but with his owne heart; which so long as guilt remaines, wil ever be misgiving and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of doubts; there must therfore be a higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than the soule of man to quiet and allay its owne troubles.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables us to the practise of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> those duties, which by nature wee are averse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as to love an enemie, to overcome our revenge,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2552:97"/>
to be humble in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and contented with any estate. It drawes our affection heavenward, and makes us delight in God above all, as our best portion. Hee that hath the Spirit, joyes in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall company and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; he hates sinne as being contrary to that blessed <hi>earnest</hi> which hee hath received. He looks on things as God doth, and approves of the same, as hee is made more or lesse spirituall thereby, and so is brought neerer to that fountaine of Goodnesse, God himselfe; by them he esteemes his best being to be in Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labours more &amp; more
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2552:97"/>
to be transformed into his likenesse. He values no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world further than it conduceth to his spirituall welfare. If all be well for that, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts himselfe happy whatsoever else befalls him. Indeed where the Spirit hath taken up his firme abode, that soul will little set by any outward change. Nothing can be very ill with a man that hath all well within him.</p>
            <p>But that I may not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract your thoughts, you <note place="margin">Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of the Spirits inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, out of Rom. 8.</note> shall find divers properties of the Spirit of God in <hi>Romans</hi> 8. which I will briefly touch. First, it is said that the Spirit where it is, <hi>dwells</hi> in that heart, as
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2552:98"/>
in an house, <hi>it rules</hi> where ever it comes. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost will not be an underling to our lusts, it repaires and makes up all our inward breaches. The Spirit prepares his owne dwelling, he begets know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and acquaintance of God within us; hee is not in us as hee is in the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, hee onely knocks at their hearts, but hath not his abode there.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> comes into a man, hee subdues whatsoever is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, and makes way for it self by pulling down all strong holds which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it; therefore wee are said <hi>to mortifie the deeds of the flesh,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> ver
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2552:98"/>
13. Those that by help of the Spirit have got the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of sinne, can in no wise be led as slaves by the <hi>flesh:</hi> as on the contrary, he that cherishes corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and crucifies it not (by spirituall reasons, but out of civill respects to be freed from aspersions, and to uphold his reputation or the like) is a meere stranger to the Holy Ghosts working.</p>

               <hi>are the Sonnes of God.</hi> As the Angell went before the <hi>Israelites</hi> from <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan;</hi> so the Spirit of God goes along with his in all their wayes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooving all lets, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2552:99"/>
strengthening against all impediments in their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian race. It conducts us sweetly, not (violently) as the Devill doth those that are possessed with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; wee are led strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeed, because it is against corruption within us, and opposition from without us, but yet sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preserve the liberty and freedome of the soule still. We are all by nature like children or blinde men, wee cannot lead our selves, the Spirit must be our conduct, or wee shall wander and goe aside pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently. Those therefore that enjoy the same, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to its gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and direction in all things.</p>

Again, <hi>the Spirit stirres</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
               <hi>up sighes and groanes, that cannot be expressed.</hi> When we are not able to pray, or lay open the griefes of our soules, if wee can but send out sighes &amp; groanes to heaven, they shall bee accepted; for God will heare the voyce of his own Spirit, from whence these sobs &amp; complaints come. How should wee be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with despaire, did not the Spirit support us? Those therefore that in extremity have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to comfort them, yet are able to send forth holy desires to the Lord, may certainly conclude that the Spirit is in them.</p>
            <p>Again, the Spirit <hi>makes</hi>

               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:2552:100"/>
               <hi>us mourne, and wait for the adoption of sonnes,</hi> the same Spirit that <hi>sanctifies</hi> a sinner, <hi>witnesses</hi> to his soule, that God is his. Worldlings grieve not for their absence from Christ, neither at all long they for his blessed appearing, because their heaven is here. They mourne not for the hidden distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and secret imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sections of their soules, whereas the godly are much in condemning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for that which no creature can tax them of; Want of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with their Maker, straitnesse of spirit, distraction in dutie, that they cannot obey as they would; these exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2552:100"/>
deject them, yet wait they will without despaire, till God have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished their course; there is such a divine power in <hi>faith,</hi> as a very little beam of it, having no other help than a naked promise, will uphold the soule against the greatest discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keepe it from utter sinking.</p>
            <p>Indeed, <hi>waiting</hi> is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult duty, both in regard of the long day, which God usually takes before he performes his promise, as also by reason of the untowardnesse of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, being ready to be put off by the least frown, did not God by a Spirit of constancie preserve the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2552:101"/>
soule immoveable in all conditions, whether pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or to come, so as it failes not before him; and why? because it knowes full well, that God in whom it rests, is unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably good.</p>
            <p>Alas, we are at the best but light and vaine crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, till the divine Spirit fix and settle us: the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er our Union is here, the surer will be our standing in all danger; for what can daunt that soul, which in the greatest troubles hath made the great good to bee his owne? Such a person dares chearefully encounter any oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as having a Spirit high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the world about

            <p>First attend upon the <note place="margin">Answ.</note> teaching of the Gospell. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>Received ye the Spirit, by the hearing of the Law, or of faith preached?</hi> saith the Apostle; The Spirit it usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given, with a cleare unfolding of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, omit like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> no meanes wherein the Spirit is effectuall, for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2552:102"/>
as a man walking in a Garden (though he think not of it) drawes a sweet sent of the flowers. So the word of God being dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Spirit, leaves a heavenly favour in such as converse with it. The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man is like water that runnes through Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls. Wee see Baths have their warmth from Mineralls that they runne thorough. So it is with the soule in its holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. When it hath to deale with good books and good company, it draweth a spirituall tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from these things, and is bettered by them.</p>
            <p>Withall, take heed that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thou <hi>grieve not the holy</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:2552:102"/>

If Christ be willing to give us his Spirit, it must needs be our owne fault if wee remain carnall.

Comforter, than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre our base lusts before his motions, leading to happinesse? What grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unkindnesse can a man doe his friend, than to slight his loving directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and embrace the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of a professed ene mie? The Holy Ghost presses such forcible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons upon us of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly n indednesse, and de spising earthly things, that it is more than evident, none are damned in the bosone of the <hi>Church,</hi> but those that set a bar against the Spirit of God in their hearts; such are damned, because they will bee damned, that (say the Preacher what hee
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2552:104"/>
will) think it better to bee as they are, than to entertaine such a guest as will marre, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all that was there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Take heed therefore of resisting the Spirit in the least kind, sad not his blessed motions, but make much of the same by yeelding subjection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; lay thy soule of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before the spirit, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy selfe to be moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and fashioned by his gracious working; Oh consider how high the slighting of a gracious motion reaches, even to the contemning of God himselfe; certainly as we use these, so would we use
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2552:105"/>
the Spirit himselfe were he visible to us.</p>
            <p>And converse not with carnall company, for what wilt thou gaine there but sorrow to thine heart, if thou belongest to God: and as holy <hi>Lot</hi> vex thy righteous soule with the uncleane conversation of these <hi>Sodomites,</hi> it is an undoubted signe of a man destitute of grace, not to care at all what company he frequents.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, seeing the Holy Ghost is promised to them that aske it, beg earnestly for it at Gods hands; this is the <hi>good th-ing</hi> that GOD gives. Christ seemes to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate as much, saying, What
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2552:105"/>
can I give you better than the Holy Ghost? Yet <hi>this will I bestow on them that ask it:</hi> for indeed that is the seed of all grace and comfort. A world of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are included in the promise of giving the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>Labour therefore above all gettings to obtaine this high prerogative: the comforts of the Spirit are above al earthly comfort, and the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enable to incounter the greatest tentations whatsoever. A man that hath this, stands impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. God may withdraw his favour for a time to humble us, but to quench the worke of the Spirit
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2552:106"/>
(once wrought in the soule) all the power of all the Devils in Hell cannot stirre it. This will carry us through all oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and difficulties in our Christian race. Let a man never baulk or decline a good cause for any thing that hee shall suffer: for the seale and earnest of the Spirit is never more strong than when we are deprived of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts save that alone.</p>
            <p>What makes a man dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from himself and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, but this? Take a Christian that hath the <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of the Spirit,</hi> you shall have him defie <hi>Death, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and all: take another that is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2552:106"/>
to increase his <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,</hi> how weak and feeble will you finde him, ready to be overcome by every tentation, and sinck under the least burthen.</p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Ghost came upon him, was astonished with the voice of a weak <hi>Damosell,</hi> but after, how forward was he to suffer any thing.</p>
            <p>Labour not then to bee strengthned in things below, neither va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue thy selfe by outward dependances. Alas all things here are perishing. If thou hast grace, thou hast that which will stand by thee when these faile, the Comforter shal never
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:2552:107"/>
be taken away. What are all friends in the world to the Holy Ghost? This will speake to God for us when no creature dares looke him in the face. The Spirit will make requests with sighes and groanes in our behalfe, and wee may be sure we shall bee heard, when that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for us. What Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can shut up the Spirit of God? Oh gaine this what ever thou losest, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to thy chiefe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The very earnest of the Spirit is far more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, than the creatures full quint essence. If the Promises layd hold on by faith, quicken and cheare the soule, what shall the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:2552:107"/>
accomplishment of them doe? If the giving a taste of Heaven so lift our souls above all earthly discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, how glorious shall we shine forth, when the Spirit shall be all in all in us? This will make us more or lesse fruitfull, more or lesse glorious in our profession, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in obedience through our whole course.</p>
            <p>If we want this we can never be thankfull for any thing, for it is the love of God that sweetens every mercy to us, (and indeed is more to be valued than any blessing we enjoy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides) which if we eye not or are ignorant of, what can we expect but wrath
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2552:108"/>
and displeasure in all that befals us? Oh it is sweet to see favours and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits issuing from grace and love: they doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes proove mercies which men oft times e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme to be so. We can have no sollid comfort in any condition, further than God smiles upon us in it. What a fearefull case must that then be, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man cannot be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for what he hath.</p>
            <p>Every condition and place we are in, should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be a witnesse of our thankfulnesse to God; we must not think life was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven onely to live in. Our life should not be the end of it selfe, but the praise
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2552:108"/>
of the giver thereof. It is but fit that we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all that is good to his glory, who hath joyned his glory to our best good, in being glorified in our salvation, which while we question and doubt of, it is impossible ever to bee cheerfull towards him.</p>
            <p>Besides, how can a man suffer willingly, that knowes not that God hath begun any good work in him? How lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish and dead is he under the crosse without this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance? It is worth the considering, to see two men of equall parts under the same afliction, how quietly and calmly the one that hath interest in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2552:109"/>
Christ will beare his grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, whereas the other rages as a foole, and is more beaten. A man will endure any thing comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably when he considers it proceeds from his Fathers good pleasure. This breeds a holy resigning of our selves to God in al estates; as <hi>Eli,</hi> the wil of the Lord be done; his will is a wise will, and ever conduceth to his peoples good.</p>
            <p>Fearest thou danger, cry unto God, I am thine, Lord save me; I am the price of thy Sons blood, let me not be lost, thou hast given me the earnest of thy Spirit, and set thy seale upon me for thine owne, let mee neither
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2552:109"/>
lose my bargaine nor thou thine.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that Gods childe can so easily deny himselfe in tentations and allurements which others sinck under. Oh saith he, the Holy Ghost hath sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me up to the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, shall I grieve and quench the same for this base lust? It is a great disparagement to preferre husks before the provision of our Fathers House: when we give content to Sathan and a wretched heart, wee put the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost out of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>Againe, without this we can never comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly depart this life: hee
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2552:110"/>
that hath the earnest of the Spirit in his heart, may laugh Sathan in the face and rejoyce at deaths ap proaching, as knowing there will be an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment <hi>then</hi> of all the bargaine; then the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage will bee perfectly consummate, then shall be the great yeare of <hi>Iubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> the Sabbath of rest for ever: hee that lives much by faith will finde it no hard matter to die in it. But let a man stagger and doubt whether hee belong to God or no, what a miserable case will he be in at the time of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution? Death (with the eternity of torment after it) who can looke it in the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2552:110"/>
face without the assurance of a happy change? This makes men that see no greater pleasure than the following of their lusts, resolve of swimming in worldly delights still. Alas say they, I had as good take this pleasure as have none at all: what shall become of me hereafter, who knowes?</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are three things especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the life of a Christian, or at least should trouble the same.</p>
            <p>The first whereof is <hi>sin,</hi>

            <p>The second, is, the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi>

               <hi>of Nature,</hi> which still abidesin him, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his vocation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to Christ.</p>
            <p>The third, is, the <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>

            <p>For the first, The <hi>guilt of sinne,</hi> which doth bind men over to death and damnation, that is forgiven to all beleevers in Christ Jesus the <hi>second Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second, which is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:2552:112"/>
               <hi>the corruption of Nature,</hi> which cleaves so fast to us, that is daily mortified and crucified in the Saints by the Word and Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>For the third, which is the grievous crosses and <hi>afflictions,</hi> which doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company and follow the guilt of sinne and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in Gods children, however they are not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, yet they are made to have an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent issue, <hi>For all things work together for the best unto them that love God:</hi> So that these words of the Apostle do afford us.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A ground of Patience.</item>
               <item>2. A ground of Comfort</item>

            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:2552:113"/>
In the former part of this Chapter, the Apostle had told us, <hi>That we know not how to pray as we ought, but that the Spirit it selfe doth teach us how to pray, and makes requests for us with sighes that cannot be expressed.</hi> And therefore how ever our corruptions and miseries in this life, are not quite taken away, yet the <hi>evill</hi> of those evils is removed: God teaching and directing us by his Spirit, to seek by prayer unto him, for grace to profit by them. And this is the co-herence of these words with the former.</p>
            <p>The parts here to bee <note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note> handled may be these.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, the main cause of this blessed Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
            </p>
            <p>Those that <hi>love God</hi> have this priviledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are <hi>effectually called</hi> by his Word, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his purpose. We know</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that all things work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the best to these;</hi> He doth not say, <hi>We hope,</hi> or <hi>wee conjecture,</hi> but <hi>wee know it assuredly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have the Scriptures
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:2552:114"/>
of God for it, <hi>David</hi> saith, that <hi>it was good for him that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> 
               <hi>he was afflicted,</hi> for therby he had learned to reform his wayes: hee knew by observation that all things would tend to his future happinesse. For hee had seen in the example of <hi>Iob,</hi> that notwithstanding his sore afflictions, yet he had a blessed issue out of all; he knew this many wayes, he knew it by <hi>faith,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by <hi>experience,</hi> that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing should further the Saints wel-being.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We know,</hi> that is, <hi>we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> know it, who are led and <hi>taught of God,</hi> and none but <hi>wee</hi> can be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hereof, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the wicked, who

shall never know any such thing; but what is it that <hi>Paul</hi> is confident of here? Namely, <hi>that all things work together for the best, to them that love God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this may serve to be a prevention of a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, which weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians might move in their troubles, and say, Never was any more afflicted than I am?

all things thus contrary notwithstanding, shall work for the best unto them; there is</p>

            <p>Now therefore what kind of Good is this the <note place="margin">Quest.</note> Apostle meaneth?</p>
            <p>He doth not here mean <note place="margin">Answ.</note> the naturall or civill good estate of them that love God, but their spirituall condition in grace, and their glorious estate for the life to come; for the furthering whereof, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever befalls them in this life, shall help forward still.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the words themselves.</p>
            <p>The first point to bee <note place="margin">Doct.</note>

            <p>That all good things do <note place="margin">All good things.</note> work for the best to Gods
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2552:116"/>
servants, is most apparent by daily proofe and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. To begin with the first chiefe good of all; <note place="margin">1 God the Father.</note> which is God the Father, who is goodnesse it selfe, and unspeakably comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all his: Doe not all Gods attributes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to our eternall wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare? Is hee not set forth in Scripture, under the sweet name of a <hi>Father;</hi> of a <hi>Shield</hi> and <hi>Buckler,</hi> of a <hi>Tower of Defence,</hi> of an <hi>All-sufficient</hi> &amp; <hi>Almighty God, just, wise, provident, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,</hi> full of boundlesse <hi>compassion,</hi> and all to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his poore creatures from failing before him?</p>
            <p>As he is our <hi>Father,</hi> he is carefull of us above the

care of earthly parents to their children; As he is a <hi>Shield,</hi> so he shelters us from all wrongs; As <hi>he is God Almighty, and All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi> so his power and bounty serve to sustaine us in this world, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve us for ever safe in the world to come; His <hi>wisdome</hi> makes us wise to prevent the politick plots of the Devill or wicked men; His <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> they serve to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us in our right; to provide for us in all our wants, and prevent the evills of the ungodly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against us; His <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> is ours to keep us, his <hi>providence,</hi> to dispose all things for our advantage;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2552:117"/>
Every thing in God shall co-work to provide and fore-see all good for us, and mercifully to impart and bestow whatsoever is behoovefull upon us; So that God being our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> we have right and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to his <hi>lov, emercy, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, justice, truth, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, providence, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and <hi>all-sufficiencie.</hi> All which shall ever work together for the best, to them that love his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</p>

               <hi>of his Church,</hi> to cherish and maintaine the same. His love unto his Church is farre above the love of any husband to his wife; Hee is called the <hi>Saviour of the World,</hi> because <hi>hee so loved the world, that hee gave his life for it,</hi> and hath promised, <hi>that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beleeveth on him, shall not perish:</hi> He is called the <hi>Fountaine of life, the Well of life, the Water of life, the Bread of life, the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that in him is our life, and by him wee are fed and nourished to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life; here in him wee obtain the life of Grace, and in the World to come, shall for ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

            <p>So likewise for the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3 God the Holy Ghost.</note> 
               <hi>Ghost;</hi> what heavenly attributes are ascribed to him in the Scriptures? He is called <hi>the Comforter</hi> of Gods servants; The <hi>Sealer of the Redemption of Gods children in their hearts; he teacheth the Elect to call God Father; hee beareth witnesse with their spirits, that they are the Sons and Daughters of God; he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to pray, as they ought, hee fills them with peace that passeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;</hi> And refreshes their spirits with such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable joy, as eye hath not seene, nor eare heard the like.

the things of God, which a naturall man is ignorant of; The <hi>holy Ghost doth call to rememberance the doctrine of God taught unto his servants, &amp; writes the same in their hearts;</hi> so that the operations of the blessed Spirit, are all appropriated to them that <hi>love God,</hi> and they alone have their right in them; The <hi>direction, comfort, teaching,</hi> and <hi>guiding</hi> of the Spirit of God, doe serve entirely and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly, to order and work all things together for the best to the Godly.</p>
            <p>Yea, the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are called <hi>Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>

            <p>Vnder the Angels all other creatures are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">5 Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</note>

            <p>Ministers also are stiled in the Word by the <note place="margin">6 Ministers.</note> names of <hi>Watchmen</hi> and <hi>Seeds-men,</hi> and <hi>spirituall Fathers,</hi> to beget men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the kingdome of Heaven; they are called <hi>Gods Husbandmen</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure and till his ground. They are called <hi>Gods lights, and the Salt of the Earth,</hi> both to enlighten the Church with the light
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2552:120"/>
of the glorious Gospell whereof they are <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:</hi> and to season them with such savoury and sweet instructions, as may make them wise to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this being the very end of all <hi>Gods</hi> giving gifts to men, that they might build up the Church of Christ here below.</p>
            <p>So also the Word of <note place="margin">7 The Word.</note> God is called the <hi>savour of life, &amp; the power of God unto salvation: It is the seed of God,</hi> which being sown in the hearts of <hi>Gods</hi> children, springeth up in them to everlasting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse: Gods Word is a <hi>light</hi> and a <hi>Lanthorne</hi> to guide and direct us in all his wayes: it is the Sword
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2552:120"/>
of the Spirit, to arme us against sin, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine us in grace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sacraments</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">8 Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> are the <hi>Seales</hi> of life, and pledges of our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christ: and <hi>Ex communication</hi> though it bee rough, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamest censure of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (and therefore ought to be undertaken upon weighty grounds) yet the end of it is, to save the soules of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to make them by repentance turne unto him.</p>
            <p>So all outward gifts, as <note place="margin">9 Outward gifts.</note> 
               <hi>beauty, strength, riches</hi> and <hi>honours;</hi> these are given by God to serve for the good of his children. As the

beauty of <hi>Hester</hi> was an instrument of her prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a preservation to Gods children, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of her and their enemies: <hi>Iosephs</hi> outward honours and wealth were made by Gods disposing hand, a meanes of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation &amp; nourishment of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the time of their great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and famine: the like may be said of <hi>learning</hi> and other naturall acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all which do often tend to generall and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like advantages.</p>
            <p>Yea, the outward gists of God which are bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">10 Outward gifts of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</note> upon reprobates, are still for the good of his:

for they who had skill and knowledge to build <hi>Noahs Ark,</hi> though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were not saved therein, yet were they the meanes of <hi>Noahs</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation: and so it many times falleth out, that men of excellent parts and great abilities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace, though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are not profited thereby, yet God so useth them as their gifts much conduce, to further and build up the Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>Even outward favour <note place="margin">11 Favour of Princes.</note> of <hi>Princes,</hi> oft tend to Gods servants good. <hi>A just man</hi> (as the Heathens could say) <hi>is a common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</hi> And so a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,

whatsoever good he hath it is <hi>communicable</hi> to all the faithfull: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of him selfe, that <hi>he was a debtor to all men,</hi> both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that <hi>hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all things to all men, that he migh twin some.</hi>

            <p>That this may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appear, we must know that all evill things are either <list>

            <p>And for spirituall evill things, they are either First, Sinne. Secondly, That which hath a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Sinne, as being <hi>evils following</hi> after sinne.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first sin of all</hi> which hath gone over whole <note place="margin">1 Sinne.</note> mankinde, and is spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in every one of us, this by Gods mercy and our repentance, prooves to al beleevers a transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent good: for the fall and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:2552:123"/>
sin of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the birth and death of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> Christ Jesus; who notwitstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he was God, took upon him the nature of <hi>man,</hi> and hath made us by his comming, farre more happy than if we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verfallen: neither would God have suffered <hi>Adam</hi> to have fallen, but for his owne further glory, in the manifestation of his justice and mercy, and for the greater felicity of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in Christ their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.</p>
            <p>The next spirituall evill <note place="margin">2 Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> is, the <hi>corruption of nature</hi> remaining in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, howsoever broken and subdued in the Lords
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:2552:123"/>
deere ones, this worketh for the best to them after this manner. First it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to make us see and know we are kept by <hi>God,</hi> how that we are not the keepers of our owne selves, <hi>but are kept by his power through faith unto salvation.</hi> For were it not that God upholds and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staines us, our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would soone overturn us: but the sight of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption being sanctified to the soule, causeth us to ground our comfort out of our selves in Christ, and no whit to rely on any thing that is in us.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>corruptions</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so good, to abase the pride of our natures, and let us
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2552:124"/>
see the naughtinesse of our spirits that we may be humbled before GOD. And it is good we should have something within us to make us weary of the world; else, when wee have run out our race, we shalbe unwilling to depart hence. Now our bondage to this naturall corruption serves exceedingly to make us mourne for our sinfull disposition, and hunger after our God to be joyned with him, as we see in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> exam ple, <hi>Rom.</hi> 17. where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the rebellion of his nature, and the strise that was in him, <hi>the flesh</hi> lusting against the <hi>spirit,</hi> and the <hi>spirit</hi> against the <hi>flesh,</hi> he
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:2552:124"/>
cryes out, saying, <hi>Oh wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death,</hi> and seeketh to God in Christ for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy strait.</p>
            <p>Sometimes God suffers corruption to break out of us, that we mayknow our selves the better: and because corruption is weakned, not only by smothering, but many times by having a vent, whereupon grace stirs up in the soule, a <hi>fresh</hi> hatred and revenge against it, and lets us see a necessity of having <hi>whole</hi> Christ; not only to pardon sinne, but to purge and cleanse our defiled natures. But yet that which is ill it selfe,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2552:125"/>
must not be done for the good that comes by it by accident; this must be a comfort after our surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zals, not an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before.</p>
            <p>It is our great consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that our nature is perfect in Christ, who hath taken our nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and satisfied Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine justice, not only for the sinne of our <hi>lives,</hi> but for the sin of our <hi>natures,</hi> who will finish his owne worke in us, and never give over, till by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he hath made <hi>our</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures holy and pure as his <hi>owne;</hi> till he hath taken away, not only the reigne, but the very life and being of sinne out of our hearts.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2552:125"/>
To which end he leaves his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> in the Church to the end of the world, that the seed of the <hi>Spirit</hi> may subdue the seed of the <hi>Serpent</hi> in us, and that the Spirit may be a never failing spring of al holy thoughts, desires, and endeavours, in us, and dry up the contrary issue and spring of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it is good that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> corruption should still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in us, that the glory of God may the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, when as Satan that great and strong enemy of mankinde, shall be foiled and overturned by a weak and poore Christian, who is full of corruptions, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:2552:126"/>
that through the strength of faith, though mixed with much distrust: for a Christian in the state of sinne and corruption to overcome the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary of mankinde, what a wonderment is it? It tendeth much to the shame and dishonour of that <hi>fiery Dragon,</hi> that weake and sinfull man should be his conquerour. Oh how it confounds him to think, <hi>that a graine of Mustardseed</hi> should bee stronger than the Gates of Hell, that it should be able to <hi>remove Mountaines</hi> of oppositions and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cast up by Satan and our rebellious hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and us. <hi>Abi</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:2552:126"/>
               <hi>meleck</hi> could not endure that it should be said, <hi>a Woman had slaine him:</hi> and it must needs be a torment to Sathan, that a weake Child, a decrepid old man, should by a spirit of <hi>faith</hi> put him to flight.</p>

            <p>And first for <hi>doubtings</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> of the truth: this makes Gods servants often more resolute to seek and search out the same, and to stand afterwards more firme
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:2552:127"/>
and couragious for it. For if wee doubted not of things, we should not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards bee put out of doubt, nor seek to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounded and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in them. The <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> doubted once of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> but were ever after better resolved in that Doctrine, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit whereof hath much redounded to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches good ever since. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> had the like wavering disposition, but this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more manifested the truth. <hi>Luther</hi> being a Monk at the first, and not fully grounded in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospell, did therefore suspect himselfe the more, and wished all
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2552:127"/>
men after him to reade his writings warily. The Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> hath formerly been much doubted of, and therefore hath bin with the greater paines and study of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men (then living in the Church) more evidently prooved. And when the <hi>Pelagians</hi> grew into Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, they were by S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> gainesayd, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strongly withstood. So the doctrine of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> being branched into divers erronious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and broached to the great hurt and prejudice of Christians, hath occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the truth of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them to bee the more excellently cleered
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2552:128"/>
and made knowne. For when Religion is oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is time then <hi>to hold fast,</hi> as the Apostle S. <hi>Iude</hi> saith, <hi>with both hands, the Word, and to fight for the faith:</hi> that so wee may know both what to hold, and upon what ground we oppose Heresie.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>inward sinnes.</hi> as <hi>anger, covetousnesse,</hi>

               <hi>distrust,</hi> and such like; these often proove advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the Saints: their corruptions are a meanes of their humiliation: <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> having a breach betweene them, were so exasperated, that they forsook each others company, by which means it came to passe, that the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:2552:128"/>
Church was more instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted than before. And hence wee may see what the best men are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

provoking sinne of being proud in spirit.</p>
            <p>The falling of Gods children doth much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <note place="margin">4 Carnall sinnes.</note> them and bring them upon their knees with shame. It makes them gentle and meek in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; for having slipped out of the way themselvs, and being by repentance recovered, they learne to <hi>restore others with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 6.</note> 
               <hi>of meeknesse,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speakes. A man humbledby experience of sinne in himselfe, will soone relent at the fall of others. Those often times prove the most excellent instruments in the Church who have formerly beene
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2552:130"/>
overtaken with some grosse sinne, by meanes where of they have ever after beene much abased in their owne eyes.</p>
            <p>We see <hi>David, Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> fell grievously, but being afterwards rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed againe, and finding comfort themselves, they were a great meanes of strengthning others: for he which teacheth out of his owne experience and feeling, is the fittest and best teacher of all. So it was with <hi>Ionah,</hi> when by casting him into the <hi>Sea,</hi> God had humbled him, he was fit to preach repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to <hi>Niniveh.</hi> This is a most certaine truth, that never any of Gods elect
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:2552:131"/>
fell grievously, but he was the better all the dayes of his life for his fall. <hi>David</hi> having beene thorowly humbled for sinne, when <hi>Shimei</hi> his subject cursed him to his face, how pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently did hee beare the same? So <hi>Peter</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his <hi>Master,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards recovering himself again, we see how zealous he was for his <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> &amp; suffered death for him.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, not only the sins of Gods children which they themselves <note place="margin">5 Sins of others of Gods children.</note> commit, do work for their best, but also the sinnes of others of the Saints, with whom they converse and live, doe much tend to their good and welfare.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:2552:131"/>
Do not the fals of <hi>David Peter, Manasses,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> comfort the distressed and despairing soules of such as languish, and are ready to faint under the burthen of their sins? And do not the registry of their sins in Scripture, give hope to us that God will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to our sins also: we may not think it is Gods will, to set upon perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Record, the sinnes of his servants for their shame, disgrace, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, but for our comfort, who live and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to the end of the world. And the faults of the Saints have two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uses, whereof the one is for <hi>comfort,</hi> the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:2552:132"/>
other for <hi>instruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The use in regard of comfort, is this: God hath <note place="margin">Vse.</note> shewed mercy to <hi>David, Paul, Peter,</hi> and others, sinning grievously against him, and repenting of the same; Therefore if I also shall sinne, and truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent as they did, surely God is where he was, as full of mercy and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to forgive, <hi>now</hi> as ever.</p>
            <p>The second use for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction <note place="margin">Vse.</note> is this; If such excellent and eminent Saints by sinne have fallen grievously? how then much more are we poore weak soules subject to fall, if wee neglect watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse over our selves? If a
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:2552:132"/>
weak Christian oft assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with tentations, should not see the falls &amp; slips of Gods worthier servants, he would be in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full desperation, and cry out of himselfe, saying, Alas, what shall I doe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any so assaulted and tempted, so cast downe, and overcome in temptations as I am; and therefore my case is more fearesull, and worse than ever was any; But when hee considereth the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous falls of Gods speciall servants, how they have stepped aside foulely, and yet obtained mercy; by their examples hee begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be revived, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inward comfort;

wherby it is evident, that all sinnes whatsoever of Gods Elect, as vile and as loathsome as they are, doe by Gods providence, and our owne serious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance turne to their good, and the good of those with whom they live.</p>
            <p>The next spirituall Evill, is that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth <note place="margin">4 Deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> after sinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, viz. <hi>Gods desertion,</hi> or forsaking of us, when he seemes to hide his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from men, after they have sinned against him; when God manifests him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as an enemie to his people, this grieves them more than any thing else in the world beside; wee see <hi>David</hi> how hee calls
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:2552:134"/>
upon God, not to <hi>rebuke him in his wrath, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake</hi>

               <hi>him in his displeasure,</hi> where hee sheweth how grievously he was afflicted with the anger of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
            <p>But albeit that God doth seeme sometimes to forsake his servants, it is not for their confusion, but for their consolation; for by this meanes they come to be poore in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and wonderfully emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied of themselves. And it is very observable, that when such as are thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, and afflicted inwardly, come to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver strength and peace againe, they often prove the most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:2552:135"/>
of all others; walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with more care to avoid offence all their lives after.</p>
            <p>Christ Jesus himselfe, though hee never sinned, but onely stood (as a surety) in our roome to pay the ransome of our debts, seemed to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of God his Father; and because hee was thus thus humbled, therefore hee was after most highly exalted above all, both in heaven and in earth. So <hi>Iob</hi> seemed to be forsaken, and doth grievously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moane his miseries, but this was not because hee had sinned against God, more grievously than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had done, but for
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:2552:135"/>
the <hi>triall</hi> of his faith and patience, to give him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Gods love to him in the crosse, that he might cleave the closer to his Maker all his time after.</p>
            <p>Another Evill arising <note place="margin">5 Wounded Spirit.</note> from the guiltinesse of sin, is <hi>anguish of mind,</hi> and <hi>a wounded spirit, which</hi> (saith Salomon) <hi>who can beare?</hi> But for all this, griefe for sinne, is an happy griefe; yea, a griefe never to bee grieved for. This <hi>wound</hi> in spirit breedeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a <hi>sound</hi> spirit; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is good, &amp; Faith in Christ is good; But what doth prepare us to these happy graces? Is it not a wounded spirit?
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2552:136"/>
Who would ever repent of his sinnes, and lay hold on Christ for remission of the same, if hee were not pricked and pierced in the sence thereof; Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth himselfe to bee a <hi>Physitian;</hi> but to whom? <hi>To the lost Sheepe of Israel.</hi> He promiseth <hi>ease</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment, but to whom? <hi>To them that are weary, and laden with the burthen of their sinnes; The Spirit of the Lord was upon him, that he might preach the Gospell to the poore,</hi> and <hi>hee was sent to heale the broken hearted, that hee might</hi>

Againe, divers Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doe walk very heavily <note place="margin">6 Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous thoughts.</note> and uncomfortably, by reason of inward tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; blasphemous imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which oft are sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, &amp; enter into their minds; but these sinnes which so vex the soules of poore Christians, are a meanes of their humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, causing them to sue more earnestly to God for pardon. And these sinfull corruptions doe further serve for a testimony to themselves, that they are not under the power of Sathan, but live in the Kingdome of grace; for if they were captived to the Devill, and under his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, then would he
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:2552:137"/>
never molest &amp; vex them, but suffer them quietly to live and die in their sins, but because they are from under his rule and jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, therefore hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexeth &amp; troubleth them all he can: By which it is evident, that all sinnes by Gods mercy and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, do work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the best unto us.</p>
            <p>Yea, the circumstances of sin as <hi>continuance</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <note place="margin">7 Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in sinne.</note> which much agravates the sinne; when such a one truly repents, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to Christ, it maketh him more zealous, and watchfull ever after; as wee see in <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Thiefe</hi> on the Crosse, who finding favour, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:2552:137"/>
his worthinesse of punishment, reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his fellow on the Crosse, &amp; justifieth Christ to have done all things well, and so giving glory unto God, and crying for mercy, receiveth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable promise of an heavenly Kingdome. All things are possible to God. We can never be so ill, as he is powerfull and good, God can bring contrary out of contrary. He hath promised to poure cleane water upon us, which <hi>faith</hi> sues out, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that Christ hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon him to purge his <hi>Spouse,</hi> and make her fit for himselfe.</p>
            <p>Further, the very <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapses</hi>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:2552:138"/>
and <hi>back-slidings</hi> of Gods servants into sinne, doe not argue no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but a weak repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and therefore when they are againe rebuked and turned from sin, their <hi>relapses</hi> doe make them set upon the service of God more strongly, and runne more constantly in his wayes. Where true grace is, sinne looses strength, by every new fall; for hence issues deeper humility, stronger hatred of evill, fresh indignation against our selves, more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the deceitfulnesse of our hearts, and renued resolutions till sinne bee brought under. <hi>Adam</hi> lost all by <hi>once</hi> sinning, but we

are under a better cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (a covenant of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) and are encouraged to go to God every day, for the sins of that day.</p>
            <p>For it is not with God as it is with men, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended will scarce be reconciled, but God offended still offereth mercy. He is not only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive us when we returne, but perswades, and intreates us to come unto him: yea, after <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding</hi> and false dealing with him, wherein he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes no mercy to bee shewed by man, yet he wil take liberty to shew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy himselfe, as in <hi>Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, If a man have an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Wife, and shall put</hi>

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:2552:141"/>
their inner man: for the lesse they have in this world, the greater and larger happinesse shall they partake of in another world. What they lose one way, is supplied ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whatsoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort we have in goods or friends below, it is all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from God above, who still remaines, though these be taken away.

for him, <hi>honour, riches, pleasures, friends,</hi> all; so much the sweeter, by how much we have them more immediately from the Spring-head. Our <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>friends,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> it selfe may soon depart. But God never loseth his right in us, nor we our interest in him. Every thing beneath, teaches us by the vanity and vexation we finde in them, that our happinesse is not there; they send us to God, they may make us worse, but better they cannot: our nature is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them, and ordained for a greater good: they can but go along with us for a while, and their end swallowes up all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:2552:142"/>
of their beginning.</p>
            <p>Besides, none have that experience of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and faithfulnesse, as those that are in want and misery: God in his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome foreseeing what is best for his servants, knowes, that the more worldly wealth they doe abound in, the lesse their estimation would be of heavenly things: he sees how apt the poore crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to be carried away with present comfort, and to have his love drawne to the world from better contentments. The poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer they are in worldly riches, the more they seek to bee rich in grace, in <hi>knowledge, faith,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>

what a little time they have to provide for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, thereby driving them to search their evidences, &amp; to make all straight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and them: out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward weaknesses are oft a meanes to restraine men from inward evils.

doth he not stile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the <hi>Comforter of the comfortlesse, and the helpe of them that are in distresses;</hi> and doe not <hi>with him the fatherlesse finde mercy;</hi> if men were more father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they would find more mercy at Gods hands.

are; they are a cure of sin past, and a preparation to endure further crosses, they have many excellent uses and ends, and all for the best to Gods servants.</p>
            <p>It is good we should be <note place="margin">Afflictions</note> exercised with present crosses, to put us in minde of the evils we have done long agoe, that so we may repent of them: <hi>Iosephs brethren</hi> being afflicted and imprisoned, called to minde how hardly they had dealt with their <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> long before. It should be our wisdome while we remaine here, to consider our warfaring condition, how we are daily inviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with enemies, and therefore ought to stand
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2552:146"/>
continually upon our guard against Satan, and the Powers of darknesse, and as Pilgrims and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers go on in our journey to Heaven: not starting at the barking of every Dog, nor intangling our selves in worldly things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we should be stopped in our way.</p>
            <p>It is for our best not to bee condemned with the world. Afflictions serve for this very end, to make us more prize God, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the creature with all its excellencies: are our crosses great here? let us not be daunted, but beare them patiently, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort shall be the greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. It is not only
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:2552:147"/>
good for us, that wee should <hi>have</hi> crosses, but that they should be <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued</hi> upon us, that wee may the better know our selves; If all were well with a man wounded, and the sore clean healed, the plaister would fall off it selfe; So, were wee tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly cured of our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wants, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall resistance of every evill way: These afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of our soules, would soone cease and leave us.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Sathan himselfe and all his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">14 Devil and Hereticks.</note> when they most set themselves against Gods people, and seek their overthrow, then are they

working their chief good, The Devill when hee thought to make an end of Christ by putting him to death, even then, by that very thing, was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished himselfe, and the Church of God fully ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed from hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; God suffers many heretiques to be in the world, but why? not that the truth should be held in darknesse, but that it might thereby bee more manifested and knowne. It is Sathans continuall trade, to seeke his rest in our disquiet. When hee sees men will to heaven, and that they have good title to it, then he followes them with all tentations

and discomforts that hee can. Hee cannot endure that a creature of meaner rank than himselfe, should enjoy a happinesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond him; but our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, that Christ was tempted, that hee might succour all poore soules in the like case.

            <p>Now the causes why all things doe work together <note place="margin">Causes why all things work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the best.</note> for the best to them that love God, are these. <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Gods decree and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <note place="margin">1 Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</note> is, of bringing all his Elect unto eternall salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore all things in heaven and earth must conduce to bring his servants unto glory. The reason is this, God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wise, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>strong, provident,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> therefore by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wisedome, power, providence, and mercie, hee turneth all things to the best for <hi>his;</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in heaven, earth, or hell, is ordered by God; neither is there any thing without him; therefore nothing can hinder his <hi>Decree;</hi> Sathan himselfe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:2552:149"/>
with all his instruments, yea the worst of creatures, all must serve Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose contrary to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for the good of his children; The Prophet saith, <hi>God hath commanded salvation, and he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded deliverance to Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> When God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to save any man, all things must needs serve him, that over-rules all things. As it was said of Christ when he <hi>stilled the Seas, Who is this that the very wind and Seas obey him?</hi> God commanded the <hi>Whale</hi> to serve at his beck to save <hi>Ionah,</hi> and it obeyed. All creatures in the earth are at his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and serve to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2552:149"/>
his pleasure.</p>
            <p>The second cause why all works together for the <note place="margin">2 Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working.</note> best to beleevers; Is <hi>the manner of God working</hi> in things, which is by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries;</hi> he bringeth light out of darknesse, glory out of shame, and life out of death; Wee fell by pride to hell and destruction, and must be restored by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation to life and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Christ humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe being <hi>God,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>man</hi> for us; and by his death restored us to life; When our sinnes had brought us to greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, even then were we nearest to eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse. Therefore saith the Apostle, <hi>When wee are</hi>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:2552:150"/>
               <hi>weak, then are we strong in the Lord.</hi> When wee are abased, then are wee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest to be exalted; when we are poore, then are we most rich; and when we are dead, then doe wee live: For God worketh all by contraries, hee lets men see his greatnesse and his goodnesse, that so they may admire his works, and give more glory to him; he worketh without means, and above meanes, and against meanes; out of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery hee bringeth happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and by hell bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men to heaven. Which as it manifesteth Gods glory to his creatures, so it serveth for the confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans pride, that hee
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:2552:150"/>
may discern he is nothing in himselfe, but is all that he is in the Lord.</p>
            <p>The third cause why all things work for the <note place="margin">3 Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note> best to them that feare God, Is <hi>Gods covenant</hi> with his Church; when once this gracious cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is made, that <hi>hee will be their God, and they shall be his people:</hi> that he will <hi>bee their Father and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour,</hi> must not all things then needs serve for their good? When as God tells <hi>Abraham, I am thy God. All-sufficient, only walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, &amp; be thou perfect:</hi> Doth not this engage him to set his power &amp; mercy, his wisedome, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>all</hi> on work for
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:2552:151"/>
the happy estate of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham?</hi> When once God by his promise is become <hi>our</hi> God, there is a covenant betwixt us and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yea, and the stones in the street, that nothing shall wrong us, but all conduce to our good. The Angels are ours, their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is for our protection, safety, &amp; welfare; Heaven and earth is ours, and all things in them for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe; <hi>Christ himselfe,</hi> and, together with him, <hi>all things else</hi> are become <hi>ours;</hi> in him we are heires of all. What a wondrous comfort is this, that God hath put himselfe over to be <hi>ours?</hi> whom to enjoy, is to possesse all things, and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:2552:151"/>
to want, is misery unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressable. Had we all the world without God, it would prove a curse, and no blessing to us: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if we have <hi>nothing,</hi> and enjoy God, we have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse it selfe for our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If we have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter portion here than these things, wee are like to have hell for our porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereafter. Let God be in any condition though never so ill, yet it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. He is goodnesse it selfe. And indeed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is so much a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as God is <hi>his,</hi> because by his being ours in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, all other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>ours,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:2552:152"/>
for our good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When thou art in the fire, and water, I am with thee,</hi> saith God: And <hi>Thou art my Buckler, my Glory, and Shield, therefore I will not be afraid, though ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of people shall be set me round about,</hi> saith David, <hi>for salvation belongeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. And if God be on our side, who can bee against us? If God justifie us, who shall condemne us?</hi> Can any thing hurt us, when hee is become our loving Father? Neither <hi>death, nor life, nor things present, nor things to come, nor principalities, nor po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, nor any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, can separate us from his love toward us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:2552:152"/>
A fourth ground, why all things fall out for the best to the Saints, is: The <note place="margin">4 Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the covenant.</note> 
               <hi>foundation</hi> of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God with his Church, which is <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> who by his bloud hath purchased our peace, hee being God became man, and is the sole Author of all our comfort; Without Christ <hi>God is a consuming fire;</hi> but in him a most <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Father, and ever well pleased.</hi> God promiseth in Christ his Sonne <hi>to marry his people unto himselfe for ever, Yea</hi> (saith he) <hi>I will marry thee unto me in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in mercie, and everlasting co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passion.</hi> Now upon this blessed contract
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:2552:153"/>
made in Christ to his Church; what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? <hi>In that day</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>I will heare the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and they shall heare the earth, and the earth shall heare the Corne, and the Wine, and the Oyle, and they shall heare Israel, and I will have mercy upon her, that was not pittied; And I will say unto them which were not my people; thou art my people, And they shall say, thou art my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where wee see, what is the reason of all their happinesse, even this, that God will marry them to himselfe. So that this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage worketh all our blisse; our conjunction with Christ, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:2552:153"/>
through his death, is the cause of all our comfort, in <hi>him</hi> wee have the <hi>adoption</hi> of Sonnes. Hence it is, that we are at peace with God, and have freedom from all harmes. Christ in his greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and deepest humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, had his greatest triumph and exaltation; In his death on the Crosse he vanquished Death, and entred into eternall life: When Christ came into the world, and took upon him our nature, even then the greatest Monarch in the world, <hi>Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> was at his command, whom he so ordered, as that by his causing all the world to bee taxed.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2552:154"/>
Christ was manifested to be borne at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in <hi>Iury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How commeth it to passe, that death which is fearefull in it selfe, cannot hurt us? The reason is, <hi>Death is swallowed up in victory</hi> by his death. It is Christ that sanctifieth all crosses, afflictions, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces to the Saints advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The evill of them all is taken away by him, and turned to his peoples good. How commeth it to passe that the Law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt us, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth a curse against every one, that abideth not in all things written therein, to do them? The reason is, <hi>Christ was made</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:2552:154"/>
               <hi>a curse for us, he was made</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> 
               <hi>under the Law, that hee might redeeme us who were under the Law:</hi> and thus is Christ a meritorious and deserving cause of procuring all good to us, and removing all ill from us.</p>
            <p>He doth not only over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come evill <hi>for</hi> us, but also overcommeth evill <hi>in</hi> us, and gives us his Spirit, which unites us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; whereby wee have ground to expect good out of every ill, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that whatsoever <hi>Christ</hi> wrought for the good of mankinde, he did it for us in particular.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Outward favours,</hi> grace makes us acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:2552:155"/>
all the blessings wee have to be the free gifts of God, and invites us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the glory to him.</p>
            <p>Gods servants take all occasions and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doing good by those gifts and abilities wherewith they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed. When <hi>Hester</hi> was advanced to great honor, <hi>Mordechay</hi> told her, that God had conferred that dignity upon her for his peoples welfare, that she might be a means of their safety. Whereas on the contrary, a proud heart destitute of the Spirit of Christ, ascribes all to it selfe, waxeth more haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and growes worse and worse, the more good he enjoyes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:2552:155"/>
A gratious soule upon the sight of the evill of sin in it selfe, is more deeply humbled before God, and with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> crieth out of his <hi>wretchednesse.</hi> A hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly minded man being smitten for his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, laboureth for subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction under the hand of the Almighty, and saith, <hi>I will patiently abide and endure thy correction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou Lord hast done it.</hi> When the gracious man is held under the crosse, and suffereth bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, he saith, <hi>It is good for me that I am affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, for thereby I am taught to know thee.</hi> In all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that befall him, hee professeth that <hi>it is good</hi>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:2552:156"/>
               <hi>for him to cleave unto God.</hi> And the lesse outward wealth he hath, the more he seeks for inward grace, making a holy use of all things.</p>
            <p>Vpon these instructions hence delivered, let us take a view of ourselves, and try whether we in our afflictions are such as cleave to God, and are drawne neerer to him thereby; call to mind the crosses wherewith God hath exercised thee, and the blessings which at any time he hath bestowed upon thee, and see how in both thou hast beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, see what profitable use thou hast made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for thy soules comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:2552:156"/>
Let us see how we have followed the providence of God in his dealing with us: for if we have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in his goodnesse, then will wee bee carefull, as God turnes all things for our good, so to follow the same (together with him) for the good of our souls.</p>
            <p>Now because things do not <hi>alwayes</hi> conduce to the <note place="margin">Object.</note> good of Gods children, as outward <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> oftentimes make them worse; therefore some may object, how can this be true which here the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>That all things doe worke together for the best to them that love God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The answer hereunto
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2552:157"/>
is, that for the most part <note place="margin">Answ.</note> the children of God doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> take the good of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which God bestowes on them, and avoid the snares of evill which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the same; <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>The things I feared are come upon me.</hi> By <note place="margin">Iob 3. 25.</note> which we see, that <hi>Iob</hi> in the midst of his prosperity did feare, and was jealous over himselfe.</p>
            <p>But a more plainer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of the objection is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that if the good things of God, as <hi>Peace, Plenty,</hi> and <hi>Prosperity,</hi> doe fall out at the first to their ill, yet neverthelesse they shall prove in the end a great gaine unto them; for whereas by occasion of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:2552:157"/>
these, they formerly fell (having too high an esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the creature, and overprizing the same) they see <hi>now</hi> more into their nature, and learne to contemne them.</p>
            <p>Againe the outward good things of this life <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> shew the weaknesse of Gods servants, and serve to try what is in them; and therefore we read of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekias</hi> that God left him, <hi>to try what was in him,</hi> the outward treasure which <note place="margin">2 Chron. 31. 33.</note> he had was a meanes to make knowne to himselfe and others, the pride and vanity of his minde; the plenty &amp; prosperity of the Saints are greater triers of them, than adversities and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:2552:158"/>
wants. For many that have comfortably gone through a low condition, have yet foully failed in a full estate; their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions breaking forth to the view of others: prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty teaches men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; it tries their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and layes them open to the world. Therefore it seemeth good to God, to strip his servants of these outward things. They can acknowledge with patience his righteous dealing, knowing that mans happinesse consists not in abundance of these things, but that the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God is riches e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            <p>But some may object <note place="margin">Object.</note>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:2552:158"/>
and say, I have beene long afflicted, and have had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny crosses upon me, and little good doe I finde by them, I am never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but rather the worse for all. This may be true thou sayst, but stay a little, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> and consider the event; howsoever by reason of the bitternesse and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the crosse, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto thou findest little good thereby: yet know that God is all this while but in hammering and working of thy unruly heart, thy good will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low afterwards. We see <note place="margin">Simile.</note> by experience that sick persons while they are in their physick, are made sicker and sicker, but after
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:2552:159"/>
that hath done working, then the party is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than before. It is a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to think that we should have physick and health both at once: it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a man should sow and reap both together. We must of necessity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the working of Gods Physick. If trouble bee lengthned, lengthen thy patience: when the sick humour is carried away and purged, then we shall enjoy desired health. God promiseth forgivenesse of sinne, but thou findest the burthen of it daily on thee. Cheere up thy selfe, when the morning is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est then comes day: after a fight, victory will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:2552:159"/>
Gods time is best, therefore wait cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
            <p>Oft times Gods servants under his crosse are so sore wrought upon, that they have hardly leisure of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a good use of the same, being distracted and dejected for the present, so as they burst out rather into further evill than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But afterwards when their afflictions are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly digested, then they begin to finde the fruit of <hi>patience, humiliation,</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> and are better for the same ever after: therefore wait contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods leisure, thou shalt surely finde a sweet calme after the storme is over:
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:2552:160"/>
though we finde little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by afflictions for the present, yet let us not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all is naught with us; for tentations being bitter, will not suffer men in them to lift up their hearts strait: after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity &amp; vexation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is laid, then <hi>ensueth the quiet fruit of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if all things (yea <hi>sin</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Object.</note> it selfe) shall turne to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> best to those that love God, what need we then care for the committing of <hi>sinne?</hi> The Apostle S. <hi>Paul,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> was in his dayes <note place="margin">Answ.</note> troubled with the like question, therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve with what detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he answers, saying, <hi>God</hi>

               <hi>forbid, the damnation of such men is just.</hi> But to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer more fully and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the satisfaction of weak Christians.</p>
            <p>True it is, that al things, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> even the sinnes of Gods servants shall by Gods mercy turn to their good; yet never the lesse the rule of Gods Word must be ever regarded, which is this <hi>we may not doe evill</hi>

walked heavily without spirituall joy all the dayes of their lives; for howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in regard the Lord hath elected us, wee shall never finally fall away and perish, yet wee may want the sweet sence of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and remaine afflicted in spirit all our life long.

            <p>Nay, oftentimes God doth punish the very want of reverence in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to him, as also their slacknesse and unfitnesse in good duties, so, as they may easily discerne hee is offended with them for
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:2552:164"/>
the same. As we may see by the example of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> who comming unpreparedly to the Lords Supper, <hi>for this</hi> very <hi>cause</hi> were so punished, <hi>that some of them were sick, and some weake,</hi> and some were struck by Death.</p>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:2552:165"/>
him, it is fit they should reape the fruit of their owne devices. It causeth much relapsing, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding from God, when men have never truly smarted for their sinne. Having had knocks in our own wayes, it establisheth us in Gods wayes. For we love to wander from our selves, and bite strangers at home, till God by one crosse or other brings us to himselfe, and then wee think of returning to him. Nay, it is better for them a thousand fold, that God should so schoole them, then that they should be let alone, and so goe on without controulement from sin to sin till they
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:2552:165"/>
come to desperation.</p>
            <p>Howsoever therefore that God can, and will turn the sinnes of his servants to their best advantage; yet better it were for them they had never sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at all, Doe wee not think that <hi>David</hi> wished hee had never fallen into that sin of <hi>Adultery?</hi> And would not <hi>Peter</hi> have bin glad, that hee had never <hi>denied his Master?</hi> The sin of <hi>David</hi> cost him many a cry for pardon, <hi>Mercy Lord, mercy, against thee have I sinned, forgive mee this haynous crime.</hi> And it cost <hi>Peter</hi> many a bitter salt teare too; Howsoever both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their recovery by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,

were the better for it, to their dying day.</p>
            <p>As for all such as persist in sinne, that God may turne all things to their best, Let them know that all things shall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their bane and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter destruction for ever, which I now come to shew.</p>
            <p>First of all God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and his blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <note place="margin">1 God.</note> are at enmity with them: And therfore, 2 All the creatures both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">2 Creatures.</note> and earth are against them.

            <p>3.

Wicked men though they abound in this world, yet not being in covenant with God, they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with a blessing. The wicked are but as traytors before God; And oft it is seene, that great Traytors

who are by the Prince kept in prison, are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished very liberally, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till their time of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on come: So it is with all gracelesse persons, how ever for the present they have great allowances, yet as Traytors (in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion) they shall have an hard account to make unto God for all those things they have sinfully enjoyed.

Never considering the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable condition that sinne brings men into, which did they throughly weigh, they would give the whole world if they were possessours of it, to have their spirits at free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from this bondage and feare. God will take a course, that his grace shall not bee turned into wantonnesse. First or last, thou shalt find (who ever thou art) at what rare thou buyest the pleasure of sin.

            <p>Nay, the greater good things they have, the

               <note place="margin">1 Spirituall ill things.</note> and <hi>errours</hi> they serve but to ensnare the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; for instead of making them cautelous, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to search out the truth, they are carried away with every wind of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>So for the ill of <hi>good</hi>

               <hi>men</hi> their fals and sins, the wicked of the world reap no benefit there by, but incourage and hearten themselves the more in a sinfull way, rejoycing thereat, and making it their daily talke: neither doe their owne daily sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings any whit better them, but are as so many punishments of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer transgressions: God in his justice suffering them still to runne on to the fulfilling of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their iniquities.</p>
            <p>And for outward evils <note place="margin">2 Outward evils and crosses.</note> in this life, those that doe turn to a good mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, fall out continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their destruction. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> tenne Plagues

Their crosses are laid upon them from an angry God, and are sorerunners of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wrath, which shall seaze upon their soules in hell, where the more they are tormented, the more they shall blaspheme; and the more they shall blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:2552:172"/>
and the more they shall blaspheme, the more they shall be tormented without cessation. <note place="margin">Causes</note>
            </p>
            <p>The cause of all this evil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> upon the wicked is, first, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>Gods</hi> infinite <hi>justice,</hi> which will not be unsatisfied.</p>
            <p>Secondly, their owne vile hearts, which like a sick man having an ill sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, digests nothing, but turnes all to poyson. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith the Apostle, <hi>To the uncleane, all things are uncleane.</hi> As poysonsome Plants put into a fertile place, doe invenome the ground whereinto they are removed. So the same crosses that turne unto a good mans welfare, prove a bad mans ruine by reason
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:2552:172"/>
of the corruption within him.</p>
            <p>Another cause is, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Devils malicious working by it. He makes wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men abuse all their parts, both <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>outward</hi> to Gods disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, endeavouring to conforme them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. None hath greater knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the Word of God than the Devill. Yet he turnes all his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge unto the sin against the Holy Ghost: but yet the Devill cannot sorce men to wickednesse; it is their owne sinfull hearts which betray them into his hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:2552:173"/>
Whence we learne that <note place="margin">Vse.</note> all wicked men in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> midst of their happinesse are most unhappy, because they turne the sweetest blessings into bitter poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; for all the gifts of God without his speciall gift of using them well, are turned into a curse. As <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> had good parts, but they not being sanctified proved his bane.</p>
            <p>We see further, that outward prosperity is no <note place="margin">Vse.</note> mark of the true Church. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Abundance of temporall blessings is no signe that we are in Gods favour: neither are learning and knowledge, evidences of spirituall grace: for the Devill hath greater under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:2552:173"/>
and parts than any man: howbeit, sight of sin preserves us from falling into it: and such as shut their eyes against the light, plunge themselves into deeper the misery.</p>
            <p>Now to proceed to further instructions: doe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obser.</hi> 1. Salvation certaine.</note> all things work together for the best to Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; then hence we may learne the certainty of the salvation of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. I take my reason from the Text it selfe, after this manner. That which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hinder, <hi>that</hi> is certaine, but the <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of Gods children cannot be hindred, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the salvation of Gods children is most certaine.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:2552:174"/>
If any thing do or can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Saints recovery or perseverance, it is sin: but to such as are united unto Christ by faith, sinne is so farre from hindring their happinesse, that by Gods over-ruling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it turnes to their best good.</p>
            <p>The second thing which wee may ground here <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obser.</hi> 2. Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> for the information of our judgement, is this, That as we know, the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God</hi> is the cause why all things work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the best to his children: so wee should eye this very particular providence in all that we enjoy, turning the same to our good: there is a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:2552:174"/>
hand of God in every thing towards us, as wee may see in the examples of <hi>Iob, Ioseph,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> with other of his servants, whose present sorrow and humiliation, was but a meanes of their future glory &amp; exaltation. There is nothing so <hi>bad,</hi> but hee can draw <hi>good</hi> out of it when any evill is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. God either puts barres and lets to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it against us: or else limiteth and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the same, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>measure.</hi> The God of spirits hath an influence into the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of all men, &amp; knowes how to take them off from doing us harme. All the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:2552:175"/>
strength of the creature, rests in the great Creator of all things, who if hee denies concourse, the arme of their power soon withereth. It cannot but bring strong consolation to the soule, to know that in all variety of changes, and intercourse of good and bad things, our loving God hath a disposing hand. So as all <hi>blessings</hi> and <hi>crosses,</hi> all <hi>ordinances</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> nay our very <hi>fals,</hi> yea, <hi>Satan</hi> himselfe, with all his instruments, being over mastred &amp; ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God, have this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction upon them, to further Gods good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment to us, and in no wise hurt us, which should
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:2552:175"/>
move us to see his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing hand in all that befals us. We owe God this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, to observe his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the particular passages of our lives; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering hee is our <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,</hi> and his will is the <hi>rule,</hi> and we are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to him as our <hi>Iudge.</hi> We should questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hearts for que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning his care in the least kinde. So long as God sits at the Sterne and rules all, wee may bee sure no evill shall betyde us that hee can hinder.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, hence we may <note place="margin">Obser. 3.</note> learne, that there is not two, but <hi>one</hi> Soveraigne head over the whole
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:2552:176"/>
World, which is plainly proved by this Text of Scripture. For all things work together for the best to them that <hi>love God:</hi> and things which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are contraries, agree together to procure <hi>their</hi> good; therefore all things whatsoever, are over ruled by the sole power of the Almighty. The Devill himselfe although he be called the God of this World, yet he is at Christs beck, and could not enter into a few <hi>Swine,</hi> without leave first obtained: hee raiseth up hideous storms and tempests against the Saints, but perisheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the waves at last; persecutions and perils

may follow us, but they are all limited in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hurt, which plainly demonstrates that there is but one main worker and wise disposer of all things.</p>
            <p>Further, hence observe, <note place="margin">Observ. 4</note> that there is nothing in the world, that to Gods servants is absolutely evill; because nothing is so ill, but some good may bee raised out of it, not as it is an evill, but as it is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and mastred by a supreme cause. <hi>Sinne</hi> is of all evils the greatest, and yet sinfull actions may produce gratious effects, through Gods ordering and guiding the same.</p>
            <p>Againe observe, that a <note place="margin">Observ. 5</note> childe of God is truly
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:2552:177"/>
happy in the midst of all misery. To prove this, I reason thus; In what estate soever the childe of God is, it shall turn to his good: therefore no affliction can make him truly miserable. The proofe of this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle sets downe in his owne example, <hi>hee was</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.</note> 
               <hi>poore, yet made many rich; he sorrowed, yet alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeed; he had nothing, yet possessed all things; he was chastned, and yet not killed:</hi> Gods children, although to the world they may seeme to be miserable, yet having communion and fellowship with him, they are alwayes happy: the very worst day of Gods childe, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is better than the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:2552:177"/>
very best day of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The worst day of <hi>S. Paul</hi> was better to him, than the best day of <hi>Nero</hi> was to him; for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the midst of their happinesse are accursed; whereas the godly, in the midst of their miseries are blessed.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine is a <note place="margin">A ground of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</note> ground of understanding divers other places of Scripture: as Psalme 91. The Lord promiseth that hee will <hi>deliver his from the snare of the Hunter, and from the noisome pestilence:</hi> and yet oft times his deere servants are in the hands of the wicked, and taken away by the stroke of his judgements: this truth
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:2552:178"/>
neverthelesse remaining firme, <hi>that all worketh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for their best.</hi> So God teacheth us in his Word, that he doth make a league betweene his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and the creatures; but all such expressions of his love we must bring to this Text, and then they are true, else they may seeme to bee false; <hi>The plague shall not come neere thy dwelling place; but only so far forth as it is for thy benefit.</hi> The good <hi>Prophet</hi> was torne in pieces by a <hi>Lion;</hi> and sundry holy men have received hurt by wilde Beasts, whose eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall welfare were furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereby. Therefore this phrase of Scripture
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:2552:178"/>
               <hi>(that the creatures are in league)</hi> is to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, not that they have put off their hostile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But that they have the same issue, as those that are at peace with us.</p>
            <p>Here likewise is a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <note place="margin">A directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to pray for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.</note> for us, how to pray for earthly blessings, and the removall of temporall judgements; often times worldly honours and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are snares unto Gods children, and temporall chastisements (which wee so earnestly pray against) work much good unto us. And therefore it falleth out, that when wee pray against temporall calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wee pray against our owne good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:2552:179"/>
Being therfore afflicted, we should desire not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move our troubles, but that hee would work his owne good pleasure upon us therby. Our prayers for temporall blessings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall of temporall cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, must alwayes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall; for what good will it bee for us to come out of the fire worse than we were, when wee went into it? If therefore God in his wisdome see it good for us to have affliction, we should not desire him absolutely to remove the same, till it have done us good; And then Lord deale with us as seemes best in thine own eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:2552:179"/>
As for such as affect neither God, nor good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, let them know, that if all things work for the best to the Saints, then they may forbeare their successesse endeavours, which they daily enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize against them; in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to hurt the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they doe them most good; for God will bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them by their malice: Their wicked practises shall not only bee made frustrate, but dangerous to themselves; after the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of his servants for their good, God will cast the rod into the fire. Men may know whether they are <hi>vessells of mercy</hi> or no, by the use they are
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:2552:180"/>
put to. The basest of people, are fit enough to be <hi>executioners.</hi> It is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable wisedome, when men are wise to work their owne ruine. Do not many spin a fine thred, and weave a faire web, when by their turnings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices they turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into hell? What ever wee get by sinne for the present, it will one day prove the heaviest bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse that ever wee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook.</p>
            <p>God is the onely <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> of the world, and makes all <hi>things</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> whatsoever, service able to his owne end, and his Churches good. He is higher than the highest:
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:2552:180"/>
Sathan with all his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are but slaves to the Almighty, executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his will. Can we think that Gods children who are so neere &amp; deare to him, shall alwayes bee trampled upon by the powers of darknesse. No certainly, hee is interessed in all their quarells, and takes their injuries as don to himselfe. When wee can bee more subtill than the Devill, or more strong than God, wee may think to thrive against them. He is a <hi>wall of fire</hi> round about his Church, not only to defend and preserve it, but to consume all the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries thereof; God doth great matters for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:2552:181"/>
hee rebukes Kings and Princes, and ruinates Empires for their fakes: For the bringing home back againe of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> hee translated the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Empire</hi> to the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and therefore the wicked must take heed of attempting any thing against Gods Church; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the harme thereof will redound upon their owne heads. God delights to take the oppressed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties part, and serves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of all his enemies for his peoples good. They practise against the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he <hi>laughes</hi> them to scorne. Wicked men cannot do Gods children a greater pleasure, than to
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:2552:181"/>
oppose them, for by this meanes they help exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to advance them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sathan</hi> and all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, what get they by their cruelty to the Saints? they doe but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their own torment, and doe them the more good? but this is both against, their knowledge and <hi>wills.</hi> Therefore if they be loath to doe them any good, let them take hee how they attempt any evill against them.</p>
            <p>And here let all such be admonished how they <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> provoke Gods children to cry in their prayers against them: For it is better for the wicked, that they had all the creatures
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:2552:182"/>
in heaven &amp; earth against them, than the poore Saints; for a few of these wil more prejudice them, than all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
            <p>Come wee now to the grounds of practise hence to be observed.</p>
            <p>Againe, doth God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> all <hi>for the best,</hi> to them that love him?</p>
            <p>Let us not then except against any evill that shall befall us, for this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent crosse shall turne to our future comfort. It is the Saints happinesse, That their best is in working still, till they be compleat in heaven: But the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and men of the world, their worst is alwayes in
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:2552:182"/>
contriving; their life is bad, their death is worse, and after death it is worst of all with them. God himselfe, and all under him, work continually for the good of his children, their best is last, their light groweth on clearer and clearer <hi>as the light, untill the noone day.</hi> But the worldly grow worser and worser every moment: To them that feare God, sinne and sorrow, their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worst, is by Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies best for them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all the best of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by abuse turnes to their worst.</p>
            <p>Observe here the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie <note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> of the Saints comfort, above all other
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:2552:183"/>
comforts whatsoever: The nature of it is this; It must be stronger than the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of which it is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall: And the reason of spirituall comfort must be more forcible, than any carnall reason can bee to undermine it. Now what stronger consolation can a man have than to be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all things (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception) shall work together for his good; but this is not all. What a sweet refreshment is it, when the soule can say, God will either stop mee from falling into sin, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by afflictions, or else subdue my corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inwardly by his Spirit, that I shall not bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:2552:183"/>
by them; hee will never suffer mee to rot in my sinnes; but when I do fall, will raise me up again: It beares up a Christians heart, that rather than we shall continue in an evill way, God will send some <hi>Nathan</hi> or other to rouse us out of our security.</p>
            <p>Therefore to all thy comforts adde this; That God will not onely save thee at last, but turne all things to the best whilest thou art here. This is the highest straine of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. It is farre stronger to refresh and quicken us, than any grievance can be to afflict us; It maketh evill things (in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) to seeme good, <hi>As</hi>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:2552:184"/>
               <hi>Moses counted the rebukes of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egipt;</hi> he made more choice of <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi> than he did of the <hi>worlds glory.</hi> If God bee with us, who can be against us: <hi>If he be our Shepheard, we are sure to lack nothing.</hi> There is such a force of comfort in salvation, that we will rather choose out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evills, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy outward good things. <hi>Moses</hi> by faith seeing that outward affliction and shame were knit to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, chose these, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused dignity and ease.</p>
            <p>How ought this to stay the soule under all its heavie pressures? Why should not I be patient in
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2552:184"/>
               <hi>sicknesse,</hi> in <hi>poverty,</hi> in <hi>dis graces,</hi> or why should I despaire at the houre of death? Am I not under the hand of my God, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my good out of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evill? It is the subtilty of our arch-enemie to drive us to a stand, that we may doubt of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and say with <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi> If the Lord be with mee, and that I am his child, why is it thus with me? How is it that all this sorrow and misery hath befallen mee, and lieth so heavie upon my soule? But our comfort here, is, that God who turneth all things to our best, is stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than Sathan.</p>
            <p>Againe, considering all
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:2552:185"/>
things conduce unto our good, though in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance never so opposite; this comfort ariseth, That if God doe so work this or that, then I must beleeve against beliefe, I must stand firme against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries; my faith must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and beleeve that God can bring me to honour by shame, and to Heaven by Hell gates: for if it be his course of dealing, first to cast downe, and then to lift up, by disgrace to bring his servants to glory; then in all my extremities I must rest upon God, who is never neerer unto his to succour them, than when hee seemes to bee
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:2552:185"/>
furthest off. When <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hee meanes to give victory, he suffer us to be foiled first; and when hee intends to justifie a poore sinner, he will condemne him first. Let us therefore hope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst hope, and desire God in our distresses to open our eyes, that wee may see our consolations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hagar</hi> had a Well by her when she was ready to perish for thrist, and yet she saw it not: and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha's</hi> man had Angels to defend him when the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> compassed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, but perceived not the same: so <hi>the Angell of the Lord continually pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>

of it; yea, God is then neerest to us when we are in most straights. Cordials are kept for fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. When Christ went to cast the Devill out of a child, he then most raged and tare him: So likewise Satan and wicked men, most rage when they are neerest to their end and destruction. In thy grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test danger never rest on thy friends, but on the Lord, who never stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neerer and firmer to us, than when we are most perplexed and know not what to doe. A distressed soule seeth oft no comfort in outward things, and therefore retireth unto God, in whom it findes
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:2552:186"/>
whatsoever may make it happy. <hi>Our strength may</hi>

When we are weake, then wee are strong; and when we are most cast downe in our selves, we are neerest to Gods helping hand. This carriage of the Almighty ought to establish our faith.</p>
            <p>In all cases of extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Double eye.</note> we should have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eye, one to look upon our grievances and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and another to look upon the issue and event of them. Why do men in time of dangerous sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse take bitter Physick, which is almost death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:2552:187"/>
them? Why doe they then undergo such things as they loath at other times? Is it not because they rest upon the skill of the Physitian? And shall we then in our distresses dist rust God for our souls, when we will trust a weak and mortall man with our bodies? If conceit be so strong in earthly things, as indeed it is, then <hi>faith</hi> is much stronger, when it grounds it selfe upon the truth of the Word. When God exercises us with poverty, or other afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this should teach us submission to his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in any condition, saying, Lord do with me what thou wilt, only let
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:2552:187"/>
this poore soule be preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in thine eyes. Thou hast promised, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever these afflictions lie heavie upon me, yet in the end al shall turn to my good, therefore dispose of thy servant at thine owne pleasure, I resigne all to thee.</p>
            <p>Here is the rejoycing <note place="margin">A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians joy.</note> of a Christian, which makes him cheerefully passe through any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he knowes that good is intended in all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals him: with what ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity did <hi>Ioseph</hi> say unto his brethren, <hi>Ye sold me hither, but God hath turned it to the best, that I should preserve and nourish you all,</hi> and save much people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2552:188"/>
who otherwise were like to have perished with famine: This made <hi>Iob</hi> so patiently to say, <hi>The Lord giveth &amp; the Lord taketh, blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ground of all true contentation, I have learned, (saith S. <hi>Paul) in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</note> 
               <hi>all estates to be content, to be rich, and to be poore, to abound, and to be in want,</hi> and why so? Whatsoever his estate and condition was, God turned it to the best: shall any man dare to mislike of Gods allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance? Doth not hee know better what is good for us, than we can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly imagine what is good for our selves?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:2552:188"/>
This likewise should teach us not to take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at the reproach and disgrace which is cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods children; for <hi>mark the righteous,</hi> (saith <hi>David) and behold the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, the end of that man is peace.</hi> The issue of their trouble is ever quietnesse: take not one peece of a Christian mans life by it selfe, but take it altogether; and then thou shalt see the truth of this Doctrine. To see <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the Dungeon and in his irons, we haply may bee offended, and call Gods providence in question: but beholding him in his honour and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

him a happy man. So if we look on <hi>Iob</hi> sitting with sores on the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, there is matter of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but to see him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored againe, and blessed with a greater estate than he had before, this is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of praising God. If we consider of Christ abased, &amp; hanging upon a Crosse, so there will be scandall, but looke on him exalted to glory far above all Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Powers, and then the scandall is soone taken away. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore lay one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when we eye Gods people, and we shall see a blessing under their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test curse. Those things which are contrived by
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:2552:190"/>
mans wit, may argue great folly, if one part be not annexed to the other; therefore looke to the whole work towards his servants, and then thou shalt never be offended at their condition.</p>
            <p>This also is a ground of <note place="margin">

this crosse and this displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by such and such a person will bee brought upon me. The Wise man saith, <hi>That the feare of man</hi>

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:2552:193"/>
my profit, this tends to my ease and wealth, &amp;c. studying how to make friends, and please persons in place above him; not respecting Gods honour and glory in the least kind: whereas the sincere Chri stian lookes on all things as they tend to his best happinesse, and therfore, fore-cast thus: If I do this or that good, then I shall grow in grace, &amp; wisdom. and knowledge, but if I neglect it, and be carelesse of well doing, I shall hurt and wound my soule, and break the peace of my conscience: by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and good acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance I shall be furthered in holinesse, become wiser
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:2552:193"/>
and better in heavenly understanding; if I <hi>fall,</hi> they may raise me up, and helpe maintaine a gratious frame within me. Where true holinesse is, the soule is sensible of all advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and disadvantages of good. An indifferency for any company or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, shewes a dead heart.</p>
            <p>This is a main difference to distinguish a childe of God from a prophane wretch that only lives to himselfe, his heart is taken up wholy with the world and matters below; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the godly are all for thriving in grace and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of godlinesse. The wicked man considers of things as they serve to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:2552:194"/>
his lust; and if wee have better thoughts at any time, it is but for a start. But a godly mans aimes are alwayes holy, and the strength of his soul is put forth that way. He values himselfe as hee stands in relation to God and a better life; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemes all other things more or lesse, as they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or hinder his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al growth, and bring peace and sorrow at the last un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>But I hasten to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Text, <note place="margin">2 Persons to whom this prviledge belongs.</note> 
               <hi>The persons to whom this priviledge belongs,</hi> that is, <hi>to them that love God.</hi> And why to them that love God? because the Apostle
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:2552:194"/>
speaketh of afflictions; and wee know that the grace which is most conversant in the Saints sufferings, is <hi>patience,</hi> which floweth from <hi>love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also, for that of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces is the first and sweetest: it is the first, for whom wee love wee are sorry to offend; and hate whatsoever is contrary to that we affect: we rejoyce in that we love, &amp; grieve in the absence thereof.</p>
            <p>It is the commanding <note place="margin">Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of love.</note> affection of all others, and setteth the whole man sweetly a work to attaine its defire. Love makes us forward and zealous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; all the inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God is in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:2552:195"/>
As thou shalt <hi>rejoyce</hi> in no God but me, and <hi>feare</hi> no God but me. All the Commandements of <hi>God</hi> are brought by <hi>Christ</hi> to this <hi>duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>love</hi> hath a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part in this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of bringing all things to work for our good. For when we love God, wee will make the best use of every thing which we suffer or do. If we love God and eye his glory therein. Love makes any burthen easie: it makes us studious of pleasing the party loved; as we say in the Proverb, <hi>Love me, and doe with me what you will. Love</hi> is full of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it studies compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:2552:195"/>
and sets the soule a work to honour God in all things.</p>
            <p>In that the Apostle saith, <hi>To them that love</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not a b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>God,</hi> and not to the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> or <hi>servants</hi> of God. Wee may observe, <hi>That Christianity is not a bare title, but it requireth some qualification.</hi> Therefore the Scriptures when they describe a Saint on earth, doe not usually say <hi>the child of God,</hi> but they set him forth by some holy affections or actions wrought in him; As such as <hi>love</hi> God, or <hi>feare</hi> God, and <hi>walks in his wayes.</hi> Hereby shewing that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is not a matter of complement, but a reall
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:2552:196"/>
and holy endeavour to please the Lord; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Scriptures do name but some one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affection, yet it is all one as if they had named all, for where one is in truth, there all followes.</p>
            <p>Again, in that the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> here ascribes priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to those only that are thus qualified, wee must take heed in applying the promises of God, and these sweet consolations, that we be such persons to whom of right they doe belong; <hi>for all things work for the best,</hi> not to every one, but to such as <hi>love God:</hi> We must not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Comfort not to be preached to all.</note> preach comfort to all, but must first labour to

make men capable of it: To this end.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. First, wee will shew the Nature of this <hi>love.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Secondly, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of it, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions unto it.</item>

            <p>The ground of Love is a considering of God as <note place="margin">Ground of love.</note> 
               <hi>our owne</hi> God, in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and an acknowledging of our selves, to bee his <hi>peculiar</hi> children in Christ Jesus: when wee can say as the <hi>Spouse</hi> in the <hi>Canticles, I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine,</hi> this is a loving of God; not as
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:2552:197"/>
the God of Nature only, but as <hi>ours</hi> peculiar by <hi>Grace.</hi> This union of <hi>love,</hi> which knits us to Christ, impileth another union by <hi>faith</hi> first; which is a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God as <hi>my God,</hi> and to Christ as my Christ, whence issues a second conjunction, or cleaving to him in love, as my <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> my <hi>Husband,</hi> and my <hi>Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To come to the <hi>nature</hi> of this Grace, and then to the working of it. The Nature of <hi>Love</hi> is seene in foure things:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In admiring of some secret good in the thing beloved, which stirres up the soule to make out for it.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:2552:197"/>
2. In a studiousnesse of the contentation of the person beloved.</item>
               <item>3. In a desire of union and fellowship with the person we affect</item>
               <item>4. In a resting, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing of our selves, in the thing wee love.</item>
            </list>
            <p>By these let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our selves whether we have the true love of God or no; For it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes <note place="margin">Nature of the love of God.</note> us much to have this grace, it will distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish us from all others, who feare him not:</p>
            <p>First, our love to Christ <note place="margin">1 Branch.</note> commeth from the high esteem of the good things wee see in him: But how shall wee know whether
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:2552:198"/>
that wee have this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the good things we see in God, and in his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>children?</hi> Wee shal know it by our <hi>choice,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Triall whether we have made a right choice.</note> and our choice followes our judgement: Would wee know whether our judgement be good? See what do we choose (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) when things of the world and God come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And here we want not examples to guide us: The question was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>Moses</hi> should still choose to live in <hi>Pharaohs Court,</hi> and hee accounted his sonne in law, or else depart, and suffer adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Gods children: Now <hi>Moses</hi> by sound judgement, had an high
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:2552:198"/>
esteeme of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and priviledges of the Saints, And therfore <hi>chose rather</hi> to endure afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>than to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of sinne for a season.</hi> Let us then see whether wee can be contented to part with our preferment, or pleasure for God or no. And whether we do esteeme the rebukes of Christ greater riches than the treasures of the world; whether we can lay down our lives and liberties at Christs feet, and gladly want <hi>all,</hi> so we may enjoy him; If it be so with us, our estate is good.</p>
            <p>Againe, let us see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">2 Triall.</note> wee have a right pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the good things in
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:2552:199"/>
God. Doe wee delight to speak much and often of Christ, and the benefits we receive by him? How was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and his tongue full of heavenly eloquence, in setting sorth the <hi>unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mercies of God,</hi> which <note place="margin">Rom 8.</note> wee have by Christ Jesus our Lord? <hi>If God be on our side, who can be against us,</hi> (saith he) <hi>What shall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from the love of Christ: Shall tribulation, shall anguish and affliction? I am perswaded that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death, nor life, nor any other thing can doe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another signe to know whether we have a secret <note place="margin">3 Triall.</note> admiration of the good things wee see in God, is
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:2552:199"/>
this, If we doe undrvalue all things else for Christ. Worldly men are ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring of the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, accounting such men happy and blessed that abound most therein: Therefore there is nothing that doth more truly try a man than this: The soul that sees a vanity in the things beneath, and can rejoyce in God only as his true riches, is in a good condition: Where there is a true judgement of God and Religion, the soule of that man will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stoop to the creature; the soule so rejoyceth in God, as that it will not yeeld it selfe to any other. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:2552:200"/>
were both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and were not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; one reason might be, because their thoughts were taken up with high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er matters: In heaven we shall not bee ashamed, of things wee now are asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of. A Christian soule is so ravished with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of God, that it mindeth almost nothing but him.</p>
            <p>The second branch in <note place="margin">2 Branch. Desire to please the beloved.</note> 
               <hi>love,</hi> is a desire to doe all things, to the content of the <hi>party beloved;</hi> Our love to God will frame us to the obedience of his will: Obedience is the proofe of love; <hi>If ye love mee,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>keepe my commandements:</hi> If wee
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:2552:200"/>
love God, wee will pray for the enlarging of his Kingdome; Where <hi>love</hi> is kindled in any heart, there is a care to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of him whom we so love. This makes our obedience <hi>generall,</hi> to all Gods commandements, in all places and all things whatsoever. It makes us give our inwards to God, serving him with the soul and spirit.</p>
            <p>Those therefore that nourish uncleane hearts within them, and think it enough to abstaine from the outward act of evill, love not the Lord sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Devill himselfe will doe outward things as readily as you, hee will
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:2552:201"/>
confesse <hi>Christ</hi> to bee <hi>the Sonne of God;</hi> and say, <hi>Why art thou come to torment me before my time?</hi> So that if thou dost outwardly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confesse God, what dost thou more than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill? In outward duties without sincerity there is no love; You will <hi>pray,</hi> the Devill will doe as much; The Devill hath a bad end in good actions: so there are many that come to Church, &amp; make shew of Religion to cloke their evill courses. But such poore wretches, how ever they are pleased with shaddowes, are little better than Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>Againe, if wee be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:2552:202"/>
deare to us? it is a signe we love him: But can we see those things goe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and have no <hi>zeale,</hi> nor be any thing affected therewith, surely then we have no <hi>love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, if wee have a true love to God, then <note place="margin">3 Branch.</note> have we a desire of union and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with him; <note place="margin">Love co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets union</note> we will be much in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of him, in speaking to him, and conferring with him. Those there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that goe on from day to day, without private speeches with God, or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing of their soules in him, what affection have they to him? <hi>Love</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative; and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of communion can
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:2552:202"/>
that soule have, that lives a stranger to his Maker? Can wee say we love one with whom wee never conferre, or speak to any purpose.</p>
            <p>Againe, if wee <hi>love</hi> a man, we will advise with <note place="margin">2 It adviseth with the party lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> him, especially in matters of moment: so if wee <hi>love God,</hi> wee will take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of him in his <hi>Word,</hi> for the guidance of our lives, and stablishing our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences: If we advise not with God, it is a signe that we either think hee doth not regard us, or else that we count him not worthy to be counselled by.</p>
            <p>Another signe is, To <note place="margin">3 And fits it selfe for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</note> examine what <hi>desire wee have to be dissolved, and to</hi>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:2552:203"/>
               <hi>be with Christ:</hi> Doe wee love his appearing to judgement? and are wee now fit for his comming? surely then it is a plaine signe, that our love is fixed and set upon him: So much as wee doe faile of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, so much wee faile in love to Christ: What was the reason that the people under the Law, were so much afraid at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of an Angell unto them? was it not this, that they were not fitted and prepared for God? A man may bee a good Christian, and yet not at all times willing to die: for as eyes that are sore, cannot alwayes endure the light; so a soule galled
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:2552:203"/>
with sinne desires not to heare of the day of jadge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet ought wee to thirst after it.</p>
            <p>Another signe of this <note place="margin">And hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers after God.</note> grace, is our eager and hungry desire after God, when with <hi>David</hi> we can say, <hi>Oh God my heart pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 4<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>after thee, as the Hart panteth after the Brookes of waters.</hi> When a soule is never at rest til he injoyes his Maker, but cryes out still, <hi>Oh when shall I appeare in his presence,</hi> it is a good signe.</p>
            <p>The last branch or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty <note place="margin">4 Branch.</note> is a resting and quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our selves in the love of God above all things whatsoever, saying with <hi>David, Whom have I in</hi>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:2552:204"/>
               <hi>Heaven or in earth besides</hi>

               <hi>thee, or what doe I esteeme</hi>

               <hi>in comparison of thee;</hi> let me enjoy but <hi>the light of thy countenance, and it suffices me:</hi> demand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of thine owne heart, what the things are that trouble thee most? and what is the cause of thy sorrow and disquietments, whether it be for losses or crosses <hi>outwardly,</hi> or for want of Gods love and the sense and feeling of his favour <hi>inwardly.</hi> They which grieve chiefly for outward evils, are most carried in their affections that wayes: but if in the confluence of all worldly blessings, wee can grieve for our spirituall wants, it
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:2552:204"/>
is a comfortable evidence. When a man reckons not his happinesse to stand in the possession of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in the fruition of the Creator, and desires his favour above any thing, it is a gratious signe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> had an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, yea, he had a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet nothing would satisfie him but the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> of God. And when hec was in want, what course did he take, but <hi>stil comforted himselfe in the Lord his God:</hi> That which a man sorroweth most for when he wanteth it, that he rejoyceth most in when he hath it: can we in our crosses rejoyce that God is ours? This is an
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:2552:205"/>
excellent signe, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovers, that we place our contentation more in him than in any thing else: can we delight more in the solace of his favour, than in outward prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? it is a heavenly testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a renewed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. When <hi>David</hi> was in his greatest distresses; what desires had he then most in him? why, hee longed after the House of God: when the people were ready to stone him, wherein did he <hi>trust, but in the Lord his strong <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ower?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the last place would we know whether we can rest in God or no. Let us examine our selves then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:2552:205"/>
what endeavours we have every day to cleanse our soules from sinne; that so God may take pleasure in us, and we againe may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him? Let us see <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> how we restraine our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from running ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot after the World and sinful pleasures. And how we set our joy upon God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and frame our selves to do his will; I beseech you let us deale faithfully with our owne soules in this particular. And if we find that our hearts tell us, (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
               <hi>Peters</hi> told him) <hi>Lord thou knowest that I love thee,</hi> I desire ô Lord to please thee above all things, I have set mine heart upon thee, and I joy in thee and
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:2552:206"/>
in thy love, more than in all things else in the world. If thus I say we can in the integrity of our spirits appeale to God, who only knowes and searches our wayes, and say, <hi>truly Lord thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est that I love thee;</hi> it is a certaine and infallible signe unto us that we are his, and all things shall work for the best unto us.</p>
            <p>But take we heed how wee deceive our selves in these things; by love we are Christians, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour for sincerity of affection. A Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate or a Castaway may go far in these four signes of love. He may admire and wonder at the good
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:2552:206"/>
things of God, but he doth it not from any thing <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him,</hi> but from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beholding of them; he can admire and talk of them, but yet such men are without any rellish or sweet taste of the thing they speak of. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise an Hypocrite may desire to please God in many things, but not in all things: as we see in <hi>Herod,</hi> he heard <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and obeyed in <hi>some</hi> things, but not in <hi>all;</hi> he could not be crossed in his beloved sinne which abode in him, that must not bee touched. Then farwell God, and farwell Christ and all.</p>
            <p>So a Castaway may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

to be in Heaven, as being a place good for him: and hee may have some little <hi>taste of those joyes above,</hi> as is mentioned in the <hi>Hebrewes:</hi> but hee hath no rellish of them from the love of God, but only from the love of himselfe. And his desire is not such as will draw him on to the use of means for spiritual growth and progresse thereunto: as we see in <hi>Balaam,</hi> hee had a desire <hi>to die the death of the righteous,</hi> but this could not make him leave his covetous dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and find a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in God alone.</p>
            <p>A Reprobate may bee content with religion and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:2552:207"/>
with Gods wayes, so long as peace doth accompany the same, (as now in this our Countrey, Christ commeth amongst us with plenty and prosperity, therefore Christ is a good Christ) but if the Gospell and Religion should bee professed with perfecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and danger, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, it would soone ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare where mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments were. There is a resting not in the truth, because it is truth, but in regard of the good things which follow it. If we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to approve our selves to God, let us examine our selves about this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and every branch of it. The deceit is both
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:2552:208"/>
common and deadly; and the profession of Religion in many Christians is not for Religion it selfe, but for by ends and sinister respects. To which end consider further these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>Where there is true <hi>love,</hi> there will bee a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desire of <hi>union</hi> to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved object; so where the love of God is, there will be a desire of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage betweene God and the soule. <hi>He that loves a Harlot,</hi> saith the wise man, <hi>is one with her:</hi> so he that affects the Lord, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to be one with him; therefore men have their names from what they
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:2552:208"/>
               <hi>love;</hi> if they love the world, they are called <hi>worldlings;</hi> if they love Christ, they are called <hi>Christians;</hi> how canst thou say that thou lovest the Lord, and doest not desire his presence in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances? Can we say wee love such a man when we care not for his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? God observes not so much what we do, as from what affection our duties proceed.</p>
            <p>Againe, if we <hi>love;</hi> there will bee a desire to give content to the party belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; this appeares even in carnall selfe-love: for take a man that loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he makes himselfe his utmost aime and end in
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:2552:209"/>
all his actions: but when once God hath plucked this fleshly love out of our soules, then our affections will be carried to Christ only: this made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> say, <hi>I love the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Lord deerly, He is my rock, my fortresse, my deliverer:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 71.</note> a Christian hath his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in God alone; he findes an all-sufficiency in the Almighty, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore makes him his resting place. In all his trouble he will make God his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, and finde more true comfort in him, than in all the things of the world besides: therefore if God should take all other things from us, yet if hee leave us Himselfe, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:2552:209"/>
is well contented be cause he knowes his best being is in God.</p>
            <p>But how shall I know <note place="margin">Quest.</note> whether I doe esteeme rightly of God or no?</p>
            <p>If we highly esteeme <note place="margin">Answ.</note> any thing, whether it be of this or a better life, we will be often speaking of them; it is a signe men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue heavenly truths when they discourse little about them; they much set light by God that have him not in all their thoughts.</p>
            <p>Againe, what we esteeme of, we will choose above other things: it appeares we have a pretious esteem of God when we choose him, and him alone for
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:2552:210"/>
our portion; as <hi>David</hi> when he said, <hi>One thing have I desired of the Lord,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 26.</note> 
               <hi>that I may dwell in his courts for ever:</hi> where God is truly loved, there will be a fall of all earthly things in that mans esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: so he may gaine Christ, he counts all else but drosse and dung.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if thou lovest God, thou wilt be afraid to offend him, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to please him in all things: God delights not in a proud and haughty spirit, but in an humble and meek soule; these then should be thy delight. God is wonderfull well pleased with <hi>faith,</hi> for it is that which bindes him to
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:2552:210"/>
performe his promise, therefore seek it earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: whatsoever God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves; a Christian should take pleasure in: every grace is an ornament to a Christian, and God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to see his owne gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in us. <hi>Isaac</hi> before hee took <hi>Rebecka</hi> to wife, sent her Jewels to adorne her; so Christ sends rich Jewels to his children, even the graces of his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> to make us love him, and fit us the more for him. Those that live in sinnes against conscience, think we that these love God? No certainly; if they did they would love that which he loves, and hate that which he hates: what
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:2552:211"/>
a pittifull thing is it to see men glorying in that which is <hi>their shame,</hi> in swearing and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and yet for all this say they love God. Is it possible that the love of God and the love of sinne shold ever stand together?</p>
            <p>Proceed wee now to some reasons and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for the attaining of this <hi>grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first let us not rest in <note place="margin">Directions unto love.</note> an inferiour degree of this affection, but rise up ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and labour that it may have full assent. There are degrees of assent, as when we love God because we love our selves: a naturall man may doe so, but this is not enough, for if wee
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:2552:211"/>
love God for our selves, we make our selves our God. Where the heart is truly set upon God, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in him only for himselfe, and takes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in no condition fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he sees God in it. He never affected Christ in truth, that is more taken with the benefits and priviledges that come by him, than with the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his person. What friend will bee content, that a man should only love him because he doth him good? We must love our selves and all other things in and for God. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced to honour the Lord, though themselves were
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:2552:212"/>
accurfed and deprived of happinesse; and if wee could so love Christ, as not to desire heaven it selfe if Christ were not there. This were truly to affect him: for indeed if Christ were not there, heaven should not be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto us. Wee must love our happinesse, no further than we can have with it Gods good leave and liking.</p>
            <p>Againe, we shall know <note place="margin">2 Direction.</note> our love to God whether it be sincere or no, by our abstaining from sinne; If wee avoid evill for feare of punishment, or hope of reward only, our love is unsound, but when we so love God that wee will
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:2552:212"/>
not doe any thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his spirit: it is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall signe. Such a man if there were no hell to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him, nor place of blisse to receive him, yet would not breake with God upon any termes.</p>
            <p>For the meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">Meanes to attaine the love of God.</note> this love, we must in the first place labour for an humble &amp; empty soule; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>Blessed are the poore in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> (saith Christ) for such only apprehend their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery without Christ, and their need of him; which occasions an holy rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the Lord, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained love to him; What is the reason that some are so ravished with the favours of the Almighty?
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:2552:213"/>
Is it not for that they were so formerly stung with the sight and feeling of their sinnes? the more loving Christian ever the more humble Christian. Mark it when you will, and you shall find this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position manifest in every true convert, they are daily humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the least of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>A second direction is to <hi>tast</hi> of the love of God in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Christ. When the beams of his favour once shine into our hearts, we cannot but reflect upon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; <hi>We love him</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>because he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us first; Mary</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>loved much,</hi> because
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:2552:213"/>
shee had experience of Gods love, <hi>in forgiving her many sinnes:</hi> When a broken humble soule tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly savoureth the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Lord, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be enflamed with desire after him: A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian after hee hath had a taste of the love of God, hath another manner of judgement of justification than before. <hi>Taste and see</hi> (saith <hi>David) how good and gracious the Lord is.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 34.</note> A man that rellishes the sweetnesse of a thing, can better judge of it than hee which never tasted it.</p>
            <p>A third direction is, to see what motives and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wee have from the love of God in Christ, to
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:2552:214"/>
exercise our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this way. Wee know <hi>heat</hi> commeth from <hi>light;</hi> and there is a sympathie betweene the braine and the heart; the braine must make a report to the heart, before that can bee enflamed with affection; therefore seriously search into the grounds of thy affection.</p>
            <p>The first ground is <note place="margin">1 Grounds of our love to God.</note> goodnesse in God, God is goodnesse it self; in whom all good is involved: if therefore wee love other things for the goodnesse which wee see in them, Why doe wee not love God in whom is all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? All other things are but sparks of that fire,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:2552:214"/>
and drops of that Sea; seest thou any good in the creature, remember there is much more in the Creator: leave therefore the streames, and goe to the well-head of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>Another reason of <hi>love,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is our affinity with God, our <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>friend;</hi> who is unto us in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of neerenesse, both our <hi>head</hi> and our <hi>husband;</hi> were not the <hi>Sonne</hi> ours, what fellowship could we have with the Father: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such a <hi>Mediator</hi> with God, that is <hi>bone of our bone,</hi> and <hi>flesh of our flesh,</hi> why should we feare to go unto him? He hath taken upon him these comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2552:215"/>
relations of <hi>Shepheard</hi> and <hi>Brother,</hi> to possesse us of his acquaintance with our infirmities, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to releeve us. For shall others by his grace fulfill what hee calls them unto, and not he that (out of his love) hath taken upon him these relations, so throughly founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Fathers assignment, and his owne voluntary undertaking? How doth the tender Mother sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize in the anguish of her child, notwithstanding all its froward aversenesse; and shall we think there is more bowells in our selves than in God? can there be more sweetnesse in the streame, than in the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:2552:215"/>
spring? If the <hi>well</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation</hi> be alwayes <hi>open,</hi> and the <hi>fountaine</hi> of <hi>living water,</hi> bee never shut up, let us teach our hearts to suck and draw comfort from these rivers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing: What a shame is it, that men should hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at such a feast?</p>
            <p>Consider likewise the benefits which wee have bestowed upon us, and the end why God vouchsafes us so much favour.</p>
            <p>Benefits win love even from bruit creatures; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are worse than beasts, if we love not God for his benefits; <hi>The Oxe knowes his owner, and the Asse his Masters Crib;</hi> what are wee indeed but
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:2552:216"/>
an heap of Gods benefits? All our faculties of soule and body are the blessings of God; Whatsoever wee have or hope to have, is from him. Our breath, life, and being, subsists in <hi>God,</hi> who hath promised, that <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth, men</hi> and <hi>Devils, crosses</hi> and <hi>blessings, sinne</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> all shall be turned by his over-ruling power to our good.</p>
            <p>Consider what now we are, &amp; what a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition God hath made us capable of hereafter; Is it a small matter that wee should be regarded above the Angels that fell? And that he who knew no sin, should be made sinne for us? nay, become a curse
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:2552:216"/>
to free us from the curse? It was strange that the <hi>three Children</hi> being cast into the hot fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, should not burne. So likewise it is a wonder that Christians being in the midst of the flame of Gods love, should be so cold and dead hearted: it is not only the guilt of sin that we are freed from, but the unsupportable vengeance of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty due for the same: and is this a small matter?</p>
            <p>If we regard the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of bestowing his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, it will much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Gods goodnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and raise up our spirits to love him againe. Doth not he love us first
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:2552:217"/>
of all? and prevent us with his favours? Is not his love <hi>full</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing? so as he never leaves us untill he make an end: where he sreeth a man from danger he set<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leth him in a good estate, never ceasing till he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse him of glory; as it is 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>The Lord hath freed me out of the mouth of the Lion, and hee will preserve me to his everla sting kingdome.</hi> He deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers us srom spirituall evill, and gives us spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good. The meditation of these things will warme our hearts.</p>
            <p>The next meanes is to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oyne <hi>feare</hi> with our love to God: whom we love
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:2552:217"/>
throughly, we will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that shall displease. The feare of God whom we love, will cause us to make conscience of the least sinne against him; for there is no sinne be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so little, but it will weaken our affection to goodnesse. When we ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst conscience, is there not a decay of our love to God? and of our sense of his favour towards us: surely sin is the only make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in our soules, and weakner of all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Those therefore are the lovingest soules towards God, that are most conscientious in their wayes. Carelesse
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:2552:218"/>
Christians have not that feeling of Gods love, which humble fruitfull Christians have: neither doe they live or die with that comfort as these do.</p>
            <p>We are the <hi>Spouse</hi> of Christ, and he is jealous of our love. Our betrothed Husband cannot abide that we should set our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon strangers. Take heed therefore of adulterous and false affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; the more we love earthly things the lesse we shall esteeme of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly; and as our affection towards the creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, so our heat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Christ abateth.</p>
            <p>The next direction to stir up our love unto God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:2552:218"/>
is, to exercise the same daily. For true love is not an abstractive affection, but an affection in practise, and we know every thing doth increase by exercise: exercise it therefore in fighting against the love of the world, and all selfe love; for as there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary commands, so there are contrary desires in a Christian: as there is the old man and the new man, the flesh and the Spirit, so there are contrary affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one setting it selfe against another in him.</p>
            <p>When we see a poore Christian, the <hi>love of God</hi> will say unto us, now shew thy love unto Christ in succouring one of his
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:2552:219"/>
members. No saith <hi>fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> charity begins at home, thou mayst want thy selfe another day.</p>
            <p>In doing good likewise wee should say, here is now an occasion offered me of honouring God, and I will imbrace it. Oh but saith <hi>selfe-love,</hi> there is time enough hereafter; hereby you may run into poverty and disgrace, be not too forward. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall deniall of our selvs against our whole thwart nature. Those that are Christians know experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally what belongs to these things: but take a carnall man or woman, and they are led altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:2552:219"/>
by their sensuall lusts as bruit Beasts: whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ease and selfe-love wils, that swayes their hearts any wayes. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the most sincere Christian hath the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these carnall and worldly respects, but his love unto God constrains him to deny all, and listen to what Christ whispereth in his heart.</p>
            <p>Consider wee a little <note place="margin">Motives to stir up exercise in the love of God.</note> what may stirre us up to exercise our selves herein. <hi>Love</hi> it is the light of our life; love we must some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and he lives not that loves not: seeing then we cannot but love, and that the misplacing of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the cause of all sin
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:2552:220"/>
and misery; what can we doe better than attend to directions, how to love as we should?</p>
            <p>To come therefore to the foure things before mentioned being the branches of love. First, <hi>We must admire God above all things.</hi> And can wee admire any thing with wisdome but God alone? It is commonly said, that wee cannot be wise and love together, for that this affection is blinde, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in God. Againe, is there any thing more comfortable then that we give content to God? Is any service comparable to the service of a Prince? We must serve the Lord
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:2552:220"/>
only, and others in and for him, or else all we do is naught. All other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are bondage, this a perfect freedome. Againe, is there any thing more worthy our soules, than to be united to God? Can we have a greater happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse than to be made one with Christ? By loving a thing we come to be like to it. Is there any thing that may or ought to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge our love but Christ? Is it not a base thing to unite our soules (which are the best things under Heaven) to earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, than which we shall one day find nothing to be worse? The love of <hi>God</hi> planted in our hearts,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:2552:221"/>
maketh Christ and us one. As a Pearle in a Ring makes the Ring more pretious and valuable; so the soule united unto Christ, commeth to bee more gracious and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. The more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent the soule is, the more loving it will be to God. The holiest Saints have ever burned with most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Christ, as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> Can any thing satisfie us more than <hi>God?</hi> Know wee not that all things here shall perish? Therefore when wee place our love and joy in the world, do we not lose them too? We shall leave behinde us the things of this life, our sins only we
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:2552:221"/>
carry away, which cleave fast unto us, and staine our consciences world with out end: what might more content us than the love of God, which wil endure for ever, and accompany us to Heaven when all other loves perish?</p>
            <p>Consider that every thing thou dost without love, is dead and empty; <hi>love</hi> is the life of all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as we say of a gift, the <hi>love of the giver,</hi> is better than the gift it selfe; not only our performance is nothing without love, but we our selves are nothing without it; every accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table service we doe must proceed from this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly flame; <hi>Though wee</hi>
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:2552:222"/>
               <hi>speak with the tongues of men and Angels, and have not love, we are like to a sounding brasse and tinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Symball.</hi> Have wee not much to do and suffer in this life? and what is it that makes us constant in duty, &amp; carries us through so many oppositions as we meet withall, is it not love? doth not love swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our hearts, and take away every difficulty in our way to Heaven. Whilest we live here, we must of necessity suffer ill things, and go on in well doing; neither of which can be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>love;</hi> this rules our whole lives. Beg there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of God to quicken
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:2552:222"/>
thee in all cheerefull and willing obedience: pray that the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse would enlighten thy heart: wee cannot serve God without God, nor have any holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, except by his Spirit he work the same in us.</p>
