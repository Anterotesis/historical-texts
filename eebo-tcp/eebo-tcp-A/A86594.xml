            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Sir John Hothams Letter to a worthy Member of the
Houſe of Commons, concerning the late diſcovery at Hull; Together with Maſter
Beckwiths Letter, a Recuſant, to Lievtenant Fooks his ſonne in law, in ſervice at Hull,
under Sir John Hothams command, who was a great Actor in that dangerous buſineſſe.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce my laſt to you, It hath pleaſed the Almighty God, out of his great mercy to us here, and the Kingdom, to preſerve
us from, an eminent danger, and ruine plotted againſt us here, which I thought fit to acquaint you with. I writ a word of it
to the Committee at <hi>York,</hi> but ſince have made a more ample diſcovery, I have within my Company, a Lievtenant, his name
is <hi>Foolks,</hi> Sonne in law to one Maſter <hi>Thomas Beckwith</hi> a Recuſant at <hi>Beverley,</hi> a good Souldier, but poor. This man, his Father in
law, thought a fit Inſtrument to work upon, and to that end, ſent for him, to come over to him. The Gentleman preſently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
me with it, and asked my leave and advice therein: Proteſting, that both in regard of the honour of a Souldier, and a
Gentleman, nothing ſhould paſſe, but I ſhould know. He had formerly been obliged to me, and therefore I gave him leave
to go with directions to yeild to ſuch Propoſitions, as ſhould be made him; for otherwiſe being in their power, I knew not how
they might have uſed him. At his return he told me, that at his firſt coming, after an unuſuall kinde welcome, that Maſter
<hi>Beckwith</hi> broke the matter to him, That if he would do ſervice, &amp;c. he ſhould be rewarded in a great meaſure, intimating to him
how unable I was to preferre him in any way of ſubſiſtance: To be ſhort, He made a plain contract with him, That if he could
betray a Port, he ſhould have five hundred pound in hand, and two hundred and fifty pound, <hi>per annum,</hi> for his life, this he
willingly accepted; then <hi>Beckwith</hi> diſcourſed with him of the means, how he could do this: he told him, That upon Thurſday
night, the ſix and twenty day of this <hi>May,</hi> he had the guard at the <hi>Northgate,</hi> and if Alarum were given at another Gate, called
<hi>Heſſell</hi> Gate, he could then let them in. This thus overnight concluded upon, next morning he was brought into the preſence of one
<hi>Triſt,</hi> he was a Papiſt, and commanded M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Percies</hi> Troop of Horſe at the defeat at <hi>Newbourne,</hi> and one Captain <hi>Courtney,</hi> and ſix
others; ſome of which, his father in-law told him, were Lord diſguiſed: theſe promiſed him to make good his reward; but
they doubted, unleſſe ſome Captain might likewiſe be ayding, it might miſſe of performance, and therefore propounded to him
to draw his Captain into the buſineſſe. <hi>Lowanger</hi> a Dutch man (a man truely of that faith, courage, and ability, that were I to
manage an enterpriſe of the greateſt moment that might be, I would not wiſh a better ſecond) they propounded to him that he
ſhould have in reward 1000 pounds, 500 pounds for his life, and be made a Knight. You ſee, Sir, what ever the performance
would have been, they were not ſpare in promiſes. <hi>Triſt</hi> told him he had a man of his, whom under colour of carrying
Arms as a Voluntiere, he might employ as he ſaw cauſe. <hi>Beckwith,</hi> it appears ſome time before, had an eye to have corrupted <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanger,</hi>
for he had invited <hi>Lowanger</hi> to his houſe, and ſent him word he would beſtow a Gelding upon him, which he preſently
then acquainted me with, and told me he though there was ſome ill meant in it, and ſo would not go: He hath exceedingly
laboured in the diſcovery of this, being in a great meaſure ſenſible of his honour herein. Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> we cauſed the Lievtenant
to write back to his father-in-law that <hi>Lowanger</hi> liked well of the buſineſſe, but deſired ſome better aſſurance of his reward then
<hi>Triſt</hi> and <hi>Courtneyes</hi> words, and ſent a boy with the Letter; and that it might appear to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Beckwith</hi> to be carryed with more ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
the boy was cauſed to put the Letter in his Shoe: the return was this letter encloſed; the originall (being well known to be
his hand) I keep (to be ſent when the Parliament ſhall command) leſt it might miſcarry, as ſome other Letters of his, whereby
his hand may be known. I have <hi>Triſts</hi> man in hold, who confeſſeth h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap>s ſent hither by <hi>Triſt</hi> (under colour to carry Arms)
to give Intelligence: and I finde he had endeavoured to ſend to <hi>York</hi>

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of my ſouldiers. This morning I received a Letter
from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Major of <hi>Beverley,</hi> the Copy of which I ſend you, of divers aſſembled at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Beckwiths</hi> houſe: We had another, as I think,
to ſurpriſe the Block-houſe, being the ſtrong Fort of the Town; but how that is, I have not yet made a full diſcovery.</p>
            <p>I have ſent to the Major of <hi>Beverley</hi> to ſearch M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Beckwiths</hi> houſe, being a Recuſant, and to tender them the Oath of Allegiance
and Supremacy, and to know their names. If there had been open Warre, I could ſoon have told what to have done in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe:
And truely, If I ſhould have let the Plot gone on, and given them what they deſerved, I think, being they came that way
to have taken the Town, I might have juſtified it before God and man: But being loath to be the firſt letter of Blood, I reſolved
of another courſe, which was, To advertiſe His Majeſty of the Plot diſcovered, leaſt ſome ſhould adviſe Him upon a deſigne
might prove diſhonourable and dangerous to Him. This diſpatch I ſent away laſt night. I ſhall trouble you no farther, but reſt,</p>
