         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O my God, what joy doe I already ſee by the eye of
my Faith! I know not where I am; I ſee but dim light,
but my comfort is, I ſhall come to more glorious
light, I ſhall one day ſee thee perfectly, enjoy thee
more fully; I feel the reflexes and the glittering Sun-beames
of thy Love ſweetly warming my ſoul; my
eyes are watery with looking up to thee, the very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of thy Beauty, the Sun-beames of thy Love
force teares from my eyes, thou art the cauſe I weep,
and joy of my weeping, thou makeſt mee weep with
thy Love, I am ſick with thy Love, and thou healeſt
me with it, thou emptieſt and filleſt me, thou throweſt
me down, and lifteſt me up, how doth thy Love play
with my ſoul! and how doth my ſoul play and delight
it ſelfe with thy Love! my Love, my Joy, hide not thy

thy all-in-all in me, that I may be all in thee, who am
thine: What need I fear, that have thee for my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that haſt made mee more then a Conqueror

my ſoul, and defendeſt me from my enemies with thy
power: What ſhall ſeparate mee from thee, who art
my God, and I am thy creature? the Law cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
me curſed, for my Saviour hath kept it for me,
and ſo pronounceth me bleſſed; I am no more my own,
I am Chriſt's, and he is mine, he died for mee, he hath
mortified ſin in mee, he hath ſubdued my ſins in me, I
finde no more proneneſſe to ſinne, my deſires are made
conformable to thine, I deſire no longer to live in my
ſelfe, but in thee my Chriſt; I regard not iniquity in
my heart, the love of my Chriſt makes mee loath my
ſelfe and my baſe corruptions, I have a baſe eſteem of
my ſelfe, I have a perfect hatred of ſin, that I ſee lives in
me, I live not in it; the death of my Beloved that once
died for mee, hath mortified my ſinnes, they have no
rule over me, my Love, my Chriſt is my Ruler by his
Spirit, I can accept of no other Guide; though ſinne
be in me, yet I am out of my ſinnes in my Chriſt.</p>
            <p>O World, O Fleſh, O Divell, let mee alone, you
have nothing to doe with me, let me ſerve the Lord
my God, for I am his, I was yours too long, get you
gone, I command you in the name of my beloved
Chriſt; though it be true that I did often tranſgreſſe
the Law, yet my Saviour he hath pleaded for mee, he
hath procured a pardon for all my ſinnes, and ſealed it,
he hath ſet his hand to it, and hath put it ſafe lockt up
with the key of his Love, in my heart by his Spirit, all
the Divels in Hell can never get it from me; I fear not,
you can but kill my bodie, you can doe no more; the
Lord will raiſe me up again at his comming, and then
my corruptible bodie will be made incorruptible, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118445:5"/>
this bodie which is mortall ſhall be made immortall,
and glorious; then will this his Spirit which bids me
write, here come againe and own me, by the vertue of
my Beloved ſhall I be raiſed up again to meet the Lord
my God, with joy and rejoyceing, to the praiſe and
glory of his great and holy Name; this is true, for
Chriſt himſelfe (in whom only I truſt for Salvacion)
hath told me ſo, whatever you plead againſt me it is to
no purpoſe, for I have a righteous Advocate at Gods
right hand; nay further, I have Gods diſcharge within
mine own heart, which is my acquittance, you have
nothing to require (O Law) but death the wages of
ſinne, that pray take whenſoever it pleaſeth God you
ſhall have it, as for my ſoul my God by his free Grace
hath claſped it in his armes of mercy, I am his darling
his jewell, J ſee plainly that he delighteth in mee, hee
lives in me by his Spirit, and I in him by my Faith: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I have (I confeſſe) broken the Law, yet Jeſus
Chriſt kept it, and he hath ſatisfied the juſtice of God
it makes as much to my diſcharge, as if I had kept it
my ſelfe; as my Saviour was beloved of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo am I through faith in him: You'l ſay I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
the Law daily in thought, word, or deed, I ſay
no, it is not I but ſin that dwelleth in me: I have a bad
neighbour, but Chriſt will give mee patience and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to war againſt my enemie, it ſhall have no power,
it may take the beſt Saint cowardly and unawares, but
I bleſſe God I have ſtrength from Chriſt by his Spirit
that beats him out of doores, he lodgeth not in my
heart, I have no room but for my Love, my Chriſt, I
am wholly his, and hee is mine; for ſhould <hi>I</hi> regard
iniquitie in my heart, the Lord would not heare my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118445:6"/>
praiers, <hi>I</hi> ſee by the eye of my faith that <hi>I</hi> am freed
from ſin, though not free from ſinning, <hi>I</hi> will rejoyce
though ſin dwell in my fleſh, O my beloved Chriſt, <hi>I</hi>
ſee there is more good in thee for me, then there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
in ſin againſt me: O my eternall God, thou art

to thee my God for mercy; thou haſt promiſed mee
forgiveneſſe, forſake me not my God, for I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
(by the aſſiſtance of thy Spirit) never more to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
thee; do not thou leave me comfortleſſe, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
me by the Almighty power of thy Spirit within
me: how odious doth ſin appear to my ſoul! how fain
would the enemy of my ſoul undermine it, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
my faith in thee! what ſtrivings, and ſubtill temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions,
hath the Devil to enſnare the ſoul of thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
if he could! how fearfull am I when I think of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

of my heart; how fearfull am I to look on,
orcommune with the World, or the vanities of the
World, leaſt they ſhould draw away my minde and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections!
but Lord I bleſſe thy holy name I ſee thy
Love and mercy in this, thou letteſt me ſee all things
beſides thee to be vanity and vexacion of Spirit, O let
me ſee thee and delight in nothing but thee: inſtead
of thinking of vain tranſitories, let thy Servant medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
as now, ſo alwaies, of glorious eternities: and O
ſweet God, let me think upon my ſins, and the vildneſſe
of my baſe heart, to humble me in the ſight of my own

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118445:6"/>
rely wholly on thee, O that I might never act but as thy
faithfull ſervant, as becoming thy Son, that I may
be able to cry unto thee Father; though my actions
ſeem to me (as they are) unfaithfull, yet Lord thou art
faithfull, a Father to me in Jeſus Chriſt; oh ſweet God
that thou wouldeſt cauſe the ſight of my ſins to be as a
means to kill ſin in me, let it make much to my ſorrow,
that my heart is falſe, but let it make much more to my
joy, that thou (my joy my God) art true; let it ſad thy
Servant, that I am ſo ſinfull, but let it much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
my ſoul that thou my Lord Chriſt art holy, oh
let the Love of thee be my love, that thy holineſſe may
be made mine, when wilt thou oh my God? thou art
my comfort, thou wilt ſhortly ſet me free, that by thy
ſtrength I may triumph over this body of death: oh

doſt thou make me rejoyce even while I mourn over
ſinnes becauſe I ſee through Faith in thee ſweet Jeſus
they can bee no prejudice to my everlaſting ſafety in
thee, ſo much I perceive thou loveſt mee, for thou
wouldſt not have given me ſo much Faith in thee, didſt
not thou love me: my Love I am thine, and thou art
mire, I have vowed to thee, and thou wilt make mee
faithfull as thou art faithfull, becauſe I truſt in thee.
O my God let mee have more encouragment from
thee, then diſcouragement from ſin; for though my
ſins reach the clouds, yet I ſee by the eye of my faith
the mercies of thee my God are above the Heavens;
though my ſins do overflow me, yet the free graces of
my God overflow my ſins: Oh ſweet Jeſus let thy Love

that the Lord may ſee no iniquity, which thou

            <p>Oh my God thou knoweſt my wants, and troubles,

thou all my ſorrowes in the Ocean of thy Love: O my
God though I am not the ſubject of comfort, yet is
my comfort ſure in thee the object of my faith, Lord I
perceive thou laidſt it for me, when thou laidſt it from
me, thou letteſt me ſee by the Sun-ſhine of thy Love,
what this impriſonment, malice of men, perſecuting me

            <p>But let Jeſus Chriſt be thy daily bread, let it be thy

by this you may perceive (if Chriſt incline your

            <p>My dear ſiſter, let not the World (which leads away
captive ſo many) draw thee away: let all thy ſences bee
lockt up in thy ſoul, and let that be full of Chriſt, let
thine eyes be delighted in the reading of the Word of
God: let your ears be ſtopt from hearing thoſe things
which ſavour not of graces which edefie not, but hear
readily dilligently the tru &amp; ſound ſpeakings of God,
liſten to the ſweet low voyces, and ſecret whiſpers of
his Spirit: taſt how ſweet Ieſus Chriſt is to hungry and
thirſty ſouls; ſmell how ſweet his garments are: feele
the ſmooth, fine, wrought, and ſilken linning of the
Saints; ſee you minde what I have taken pains to write
you; hear, taſt, ſmell, ſee, feele, in your ſoul that you
have in your body, the markes of my ſweet Jeſus; <hi>Gall:</hi>
6 and 17 verſe, and then you will not accompt, or call
gold and ſilver, riches; nor advancement, honour; nor
learning, wiſdom; you will bee rich, honourable, and
wiſe without them, within your ſelfe all in Chriſt,
Chriſt in you; and you will ſee all the glory of the
World, but skin-deep; a Sun blaſt defaceth it, like
Time, not abiding, paſſing away; a mear nothing but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and vexation of Spirit: pomp is but fancie, gold
but duſt, fame but breath, praiſe but a blaſt, the worlds
ſweet is bittrernes: have you not found it ſo? its love,
loveleſſe; its ſplender, darkneſſe; its fullneſſe, empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
its all, nothing, but vanity, and pray whats that? a
Saint may as well live and feed on the wind, as on the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118445:8"/>
things of the World, it may fill the fancy and ſtarve
the ſoul, it may ſtarve and leave the ſoul empty of
grace; therefore have I bid the World fare-well wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Heaven upon Earth, I have no comfort no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
nothing without thee ſweet Ieſus, I am thine,
and thou art mine.</p>
            <p>Oh my dear Siſter, beleeve me for my Chriſt's ſake,
there is no conſolacion but in my Chriſt; love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
look upon nothing, enjoy nothing, have no
contentment in any thing but what is of him, from
him, and by him, all to his praiſe: let God have all the
glory in Chriſt, let him be glorified for all, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 16.
beware of ſpirituall pride, thy ſelfe-flattering heart,
reſt not upon what you have received: read <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6.
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8. 9. build not your Tabernakle here, let not
that be your light, but let God be your light; eye not
your comforts ſo much as the God of comfort; look
not ſo much on your graces as on the God of grace,
repoſe your ſelfe in nothing, quiet your ſelfe in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but in God himſelfe: our graces are but wedding
attire, oyl in lamps; joy and conſolacion but wedding
chear, we are not ſatisfied with it, the ſoul is infinite:
<hi>Work out your Salvacion with fear and trembling,</hi> untill
you come to enjoy God fully, in the very boſum of
Chriſt, co-heires with him: the ſeeds of his word
ſown in our hearts here, are but gleanings to what wee
expect; our beſt ſummer dayes here are but as nipping
winters, in compariſon of that everlaſting ſummer:
we look to enjoy an eternitie of the Sunny-ſhinings of
Gods face, love, and glory, to ſhine upon us in glory
with and to him for ever.</p>
            <p>Thoſe rivers of joy wee ſwim in here towards him,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118445:9"/>
are but as a few drops in compariſon of that heigth
and depth, length and bredth, that bottomleſſe Ocean
of his Love laid up in Chriſt for us; our greateſt light
here below, is but as a dark Vault to God and the
Lamb: He is the light of that Citie unto which thy
Brother is going, endeavor to get in at the ſtrait gate,
remember it is not every one that calleth Lord, Lord,
ſhall enter, but hee that doth the will of our Heavenly
Father which is in Heaven: be preſſing forward to the
mark of our high Calling, to arrive to the knowledge
of that Love which paſſeth knowledge, to apprehend
our God as wee are apprehended of God: Reſt not
(dear Siſter) till you come to Heaven, where our faith
ſhall be ſeeing, and our hope poſſeſſion. Obſerve, let
your love bee pure for God, ſeek not God for heaven,
but heaven for God, that heaven which is God who is
the heaven of heavens: God only in all, above all, and
beyond all: let him be our all-in-all in our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, by whom wee are more then conquerors; to
whom only (as is moſt due) bee aſcribed by thee and
mee, the ſole glory and praiſe of this my writing to
