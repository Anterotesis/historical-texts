            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If importunitie of friends (yea, of ſome Reverend Miniſters) might have prevailed, it had ere now ſeen the light: if abundance of Tracts (upon this ſubject) might have hindred it, it had now and ever beene in the darke; <hi>in the former,</hi> I ſaw an encouragement inducing a publication; and as the former was an inducement: ſo the <hi>latter</hi> can be (to me) no impediment; for, if ſo many have gone before me, ſhould not I follow? why, ſhould I ſit ſtill and doe nothing, when others have done ſo much? I reſolve not to regard the carping Mate, or curious Reader, either of ſecret Heretick, proud ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, diſſembling Hypocrite, or blind Atheiſt, who never with godly reverence regard the truth of Chriſt, or the dividing the Word of God aright. But if my ſober friend ſhall urge, that the over-plus of printing, and exceſſe of Writers patronized by the greateſt men, is enough to ſilence any mean and ordinary pens. It's true; in this ſcribling age tis too common, under pretence (not practiſe) of piety, to ſend worthleſſe and empty Pamphlets

But for my part; as I dare not put my ſelfe into the ranke of the beſt deſervers, ſo can I boaſt nothing (though I have ſince completed ſome points, which the ſhortneſſe of my time then denied) of my preſent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance: howbeit, this much I will take upon me to affirme, that, as the ſubject I here preſent, is farre from all extremes, ſo mine ayme is nothing but publicke ſervice, and common good. Books that <hi>preſſe</hi> this way (the godly Reader will ſay) the more the better: no exceſse of Writers, no over-plus of printing in ſuch a caſe; it is impoſsible to ſurfeit, where it is lawfull to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet; as in theſe things wee may, nay we muſt.

In like manner (Reverend Fathers) receiving a command from you, and an intreaty, from your Text, I have willingly (though unworthy) been obedient to both, eſpecially unto the intreatie, the ſubject of your command, in theſe words, <hi>I beſeech you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>In the Chapter immediately before, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of faith; in this Chapter hee writeth of obedience, that the former might be faſtned in their hearts, the latter manifeſted in their actions; ſuch was the care and love the good Apoſtle had of their ſpirituall eſtate; true love hath a longing deſire to enjoy the outward ſight of what it moſt inwardly affects; this made <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo importunate with God to ſhew him his face; this made our bleſſed Saviour ſo deſirous to ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; and this was that that made Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſo earneſtly to preſſe obedience, becauſe it was a grace which he did inwardly affect; therefore he deſires to behold the practice of it outwardly in the life, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian converſation of the people. Now, as true love is not onely in affection, but in action, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſhew the truth of his love; for he doth not onely inwardly deſire it, but uſeth all good means to bring the ſame to paſſe, ſetting downe precepts of a godly life to be united in faith, and to the intent they may be effectuall, the great Apoſtle comes humbly, praying and begging them; <hi>I beſeech you Brethren for the mercy of God, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>No name ſo frequently occurreth in Scripture as this of <hi>Brethren,</hi> no love more often inforced then brotherly love; Nature her ſelfe kindleth the fire of brotherly love in our hearts, and God by the blaſts of his ſpirit, and the breath of his Miniſters, bloweth it continually; yet in many it waxeth cold, and in ſome it ſeemeth to be quite extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <hi>Let brotherly love begin in you</hi>; for were it begun, ſo many quarrels, ſo many factions, ſo many ſects, ſo many broyles would not be ſo farre from an end; oh, that the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did not ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us,<note place="margin">Jo. 13.35.

more and more, till all be a like: ſo, that man that hath a rotten heart towards God, his want of ſincerity will in time be diſcovered, and his outſide be made as rotten as his inſide, fraud and guile cannot goe long but it will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpyed, diſſembling will not alwayes be diſſembled; and when it is once detected, it diſableth the diſſembler for ever after, the uſing his couſening trade.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Effect.

Puniſh me O Lord with all thy ſcourges, with poverty, with ſickneſſe, with diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with loſſe of Parents, and Children; but with that rod of wyre, with that ſcorpion to puniſh ſinne with ſin, Lord, ſcourge me not; for then how ſhall I enter into thy refſt?</p>
            <p>And this is the condition of this ſinne; for, <hi>The mouth of a ſtrange Woman</hi> is (like the <hi>Mule)</hi> as a deep pit, <hi>he with whom the Lord is angry, ſhall fall into it.</hi> And when he is fallen he ſhall not underſtand his ſtate, but think himſelf very well:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note> for inſtance <hi>Nathan</hi> preſents <hi>Davids</hi> ſinne to him in a parable of a feaſt of an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of a ſtranger: <hi>David</hi> taſtes no ſowreneſſe, no bitterneſſe in it; Not becauſe there is none, but becauſe a carcaſe, a Man already ſlain cannot feel a new wound; A Man dead in the habit of a ſinne, of the <hi>errour of wickedneſse,</hi> hath no ſenſe of it. And when this errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul ſhall have a deſire to knock, he ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to find the doore; Like thoſe licentious perſons, who purſued <hi>Lots</hi> gueſts, their blindneſſe brought them to an impoſſibilitie of finding the doore,<note place="margin">Gen. 19</note> (<hi>they were weary in ſeeking the doore</hi>) and if they had found it, they had found it ſhut. A Man when he hath wallowed long in a worſhip without underſtanding, in a ſervice without reaſon, when he ſeeks a doore to repentance, he will quickly be weary, for there lie hard conditions upon him; and he is danger of finding the doore ſo ſhut, as his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> (in caſe he had that key) cannot open:

wherefore, my Nationall brethren, I exhort you, to entertain Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> counſell; Let your worſhip and ſervice towards God, be not onely <hi>living</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> but <hi>reaſonable,</hi> that you and your ſervice, that you and your worſhip may be <hi>accepted</hi>; and by the way remember <hi>David,</hi> that man after Gods owns heart, <hi>Nolite fieri ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut,</hi> be not made like the <hi>Horſe</hi> or the <hi>Mule,</hi> in <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>Wantonneſſe</hi> eſpecially, <hi>quia non intellectus,</hi> becauſe then you loſe your <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and ſo become abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely irrecoverable, and leave God nothing to work upon: for the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> of man is the field which God ſows, and the tree in which he engrafts <hi>faith</hi> it ſelf; and therefore take heed of ſuch a deſcent, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the loſſe of the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> the field of that bleſſed ſeed, the tree of that fruitfull graft, the materialls for that glorious building, <hi>faith</hi>; for the <hi>underſtanding</hi> is the receptacle of <hi>faith</hi>; But do it not the rather, becauſe if ye do it, God will be brought to a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>in chamo &amp; fraeno maxillas conſtringere,</hi> to hold in your mouthes with <hi>Bit</hi> and <hi>Bridle,</hi> to come to hard uſage when as he would fain have you reduced by fair; and gentle meanes.</p>
            <p>But to this way God is often brought; and by this way of affliction, the cure is ſometimes wrought upon us; ſee it in <hi>Joab</hi>; wee find that <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſent for <hi>Ioab: The Kings Sonne for the Kings ſervant:</hi> there was ſome cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſome drineſſe betweene <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and his Father;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.</note> 
               <hi>Abſolom</hi> was under a cloud at Court, and ſo <hi>Joab</hi> neglected him, hee would not come: <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſent againe, and againe <hi>Joab</hi> refuſed: But then <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſent his ſervants to burne <hi>Joabs</hi> Corne fields, and then <hi>Ioab</hi> came apace. Affliction and Calamitie are the bit, and bridle, that God puts into our mouth ſometimes to turne us to him. <hi>Behold, wee put

bits into the Horſes mouths,</hi>
