         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Honourable Name his Book

the meaning of that Expression, we
may safely infer, that it contains a
higher Flight of Zeal for the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:52199:8"/>
of his Countrymen than is to be
met with in any Heathen Author,
and does much exceed the Roman
Phrase of devoting themselves to the
infernal Gods for their Country's Sake.
This is sufficient to justify the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
for writing the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise;
so that it only remains that an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
should be given why the same
is now translated and publish'd, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having lain dormant near 100
Years in Manuscript.</p>
            <p>It's a loss that the Learned Author
did not publish the same both in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
and English; but why he did it
not, we are not able to conjecture at
this Distance. However there's no
Reason that Scotsmen should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
silent, when they find the
Honour of their Country attaqu'd in
this Point by English Historians one
after another, as particularly by <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
in his scurrilous manner, and now
by Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> Historiographer to his

               </hi> who hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
a Form of Homage said to be
performed by <hi>Malcolm</hi> the third King
of <hi>Scots,</hi> to <hi>Edward the Confessor,</hi> for
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> and all the
adjacent Isles. It were indeed to be
wish'd, that the Latin Manuscript <hi>de
Hominio</hi> were printed for the Honour
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Information of
Foreigners who are frequently misled
as to our Affairs, and particularly on
this Head, by English Historians; but
that must either be the undertaking
of the Publick, or of those who are
willing to be at the Charge of it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time seeing our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
have publish'd their Plea for
this <hi>Homage</hi> in their own Language,
they cannot well take it amiss if we
make this Learned Confutation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
them in that same Dialect.</p>
            <p>Some may perhaps think this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
unseasonable, as tending to
revive old Quarrels betwixt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:52199:9"/>
but why the Defence of out
Independency by Sir <hi>Tho. Craig</hi> against
Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> who are both dead long
ago, should have more influence upon
the Friendship of the Nations, than
that about our Antiquity betwixt Sir
<hi>George Mackenzie,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> when the Controverting
Authors were all alive together, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well be divin'd. But if it
should, the first Aggressors must bear
the Blame: no Reason can be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
why Scotsmen should not
now defend with their Pens, what
their Ancestors maintain'd so gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with their Swords; and as they
did never more verify that part of
the Character given them by the
Learned <hi>Cluverius,</hi> that they are (<hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
felices</hi>) Noble Warriours, than in
the glorious Defence of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from this very Claim by their
Arms, the other part of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
that they are also <hi>(Ingenio F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

very Ingenious, was never demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by a better Instance than this
Vindication of their Country from
that Ignominious Imputation by their
Learning, which will more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by the perusal of this Treatise,
wherein the Author hath acquitted
himself as became one of his Birth,
Estate, Learning and Probity.</p>
            <p>It may be objected by some, that
the Knowledg of this Controversy
is now become useless, because of
the Union of the Crowns; but it's
hoped that all Men who love their
Country, will be willing to know
what can be said in defence of its
Honour, especially in a Point, which
as appears by our Histories, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
sixty Years War betwixt the
two Kingdoms, and cost them at
least three hundred thousand Lives:
An Argument sufficient of it self to
whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Appetites of the Curious,
to hear what is to be said on both
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:52199:10"/>
sides. But for Scotsmen to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
in this Affair, will argue
a mighty Degeneracy form the Zeal
of their Ancestors, who according
to the Testimony of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
both English Historians, did
in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, bring
one hundred thousand Men into the
Field, who had all confessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Priests, according to the
manner of the Times, and resolv'd
every Man to sacrifice his Life for
the Honour of his Country, rather
than submit to the Homage here
treated of, an Instance which is scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be prallel'd in History. We
read indeed of <hi>Curtius</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Noble Romans, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
themselves to death for their
Country; but that is nothing in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
to such a Multitude: and yet
it's probable that the Kingdom of
<hi>Scotland</hi> would have furnished a far
greater Number of such if there had
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:52199:10"/>
been occasion, when the Nobility of
<hi>Scotland</hi> in their Letter to Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
VIII, protested that they would
never be subject to <hi>England,</hi> so long
as there were an hundred Scotsmen
alive.</p>
            <p>But that which renders the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of this Controversy more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
at this time, is the Revival of it
by the Form of Homage, said to be
performed to <hi>Edward the Confessor</hi> by
our king <hi>Malcolm,</hi> for <hi>Scotland</hi> and the
adjacent Isles, lately found by Mr. <hi>Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
in the <hi>Archives</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and he
hath publish'd it as a Proemium to
the publick Treaties betwixt <hi>England</hi>
and other Nations, which he designs
to print.</p>
            <p>I no sooner saw that Paper, but it
brought me in Mind of the Story of
<hi>Annius de Viterbo</hi> that famed Impostor,
who being a great pretender to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
did not only in his twenty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Books on that Subject impose
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:52199:11"/>
Counterfeit pieces upon the World,
under the Name of <hi>Berosus Manetho,</hi>
&amp;c. of which <hi>Ioseph Scaliger,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
advise young Students to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware;
but to put a Complement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the City of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> the Place of
his Nativity, he ordered some Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be ingraven, and hiding them
amongst the Vines caus'd them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to be dug up, and carrying
them in triumph to the Magistrates,
pretended that he had found Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which made it appear, that their
City was much elder than <hi>Rome,</hi> and
that it was built by <hi>Isis</hi> and <hi>Osiris,</hi>
who lived about two thousand Years
before <hi>Romulus.</hi> I would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to reflect upon Mr. <hi>Ryme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
as if this Counterfeit Homage were of
his Contrivance, for I doubt not but
he found it, where he says he did;
but that it is a Counterfeit, and that
none of the oldest standing, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
will appear by what follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:52199:11"/>1. That there's no mention made
thereof by <hi>Edward</hi> the first, in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth,
who charged him with making an
unjust War upon the Scots, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him to desist on Pain of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication:
Now can any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Man believe, that if there
had been such an Authentick Record
of Homage performed for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Scotland</hi> not much above two
hundred Years before his own Time,
that this Prince who traced the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
History of his Country as far
as <hi>Brute</hi> with his <hi>Trojans,</hi> and search'd
all the Records both of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland</hi> for Arguments to support
this pretended Homage, could have
miss'd of such an Authentick Piece
as this if it had been then in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives
of the Nation?</p>
            <p>2. When <hi>Richard</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi>
as appears by his Charter mentioned
in <hi>Hoveden,</hi> restored to <hi>William</hi> King
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:52199:12"/>
of <hi>Scotland</hi> all the Monuments of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
either performed, or which had
been said to be performed for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
upon the Publick Faith of the
Kingdom; Is it reasonable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that either the Government of
<hi>Scotland</hi> would have been so silly as
to have neglected the demanding of
such an Authentick Record, had there
been any such, or that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> would have broken
the Publick Faith to have retained
it? It's true, that there's a Caveat in
that Charter, that if any such Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
were retained through for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness,
they were <hi>ipso facto</hi> to be
held Null and Void; but that will
nothing help our Adversaries, for it's
not to be supposed, that an Homage
performed in full Parliament, as this
is said to have been, could be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by either of the Nations.</p>
            <p>3. It is not to be thought that
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth would have omitted
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:52199:12"/>
this Evidence of our Homage in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his
Declaration of War against <hi>Iames</hi> the
<hi>5th</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein he amass'd all
that could be said for the same, had
there been any such thing in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives
of his Kingdom. By all which
it will appear, that either there was
no such Record then in the Archives,
or that it was not known, or at least
not look'd upon as Authentick: but
that it was unknown is next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
seeing it is pretended to have
been performed in full Parliament;
that it should not have been esteem'd
Authentick if it had been known, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
improbable, seeing it carries a fairer
Countenance than the Arguments they
made use of from <hi>Brutus,</hi> &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there's Reason to presume it was
forg'd since that time, and probably in
Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, because when fresh
enquiries were made into the Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>England</hi> to this Homage, in the
time of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. there's no mention
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:52199:13"/>
of this Record, as appears by Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net's
History of the Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now I shall exhibite the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it self, first in Latin, exactly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Copy printed by Mr. <hi>Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
then in as good English as the
barbarous and incongruous Latin
will bear, and make such Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon it, as will clearly evince its
being a Counterfeit.</p>

            <p>There are many Exceptions to be
brought against this Homage, as that
it is contrary to all the Forms of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
recorded even in the English
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:52199:15"/>
Histories, having an impertinent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress

Nature of a Prayer, <hi>O Domine Noster,</hi>
&amp;c. an affected Genealogy of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi>
Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> which is nothing
at all to the purpose; a Title by
which never any of the Kings of
<hi>Scotland</hi> design'd themselves, <hi>viz. Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum
&amp; Insularum adjacentium:</hi> Not
was there then any Earl of <hi>Carrick</hi> or
<hi>Rothsay,</hi> and the eldest Son of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was long before that time enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
Prince of <hi>Cumberland.</hi> Nor is it
to be forgot that there is no mention
in this Homage of the Northern
Counties though then possess'd by
the <hi>Scots,</hi> which is another Argument
of its being a Forgery. It is also to
be observed, that <hi>Rothsay</hi> was no Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
belonging to the Royal Family,
till the <hi>Stuarts</hi> came to the Crown
which was in 1377, being 311 Years
after the Date of this Homage; for
<hi>Rothsay</hi> is a Town and Castle in the

Son to King <hi>Robert</hi> the third, about
1390, which is 324 Years after this
Homage.</p>
            <p>We might also object against the
Word <hi>Parliament</hi> as being French, and
not probably us'd in <hi>England</hi> till after
the Conquest; their publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
at that time being called <hi>Wittena
a Gemots,</hi> which if rendred in Latin
then, ought either to have been <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus
Saprentum</hi> according to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Words, or <hi>Conventus Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinum,</hi>
of <hi>Comitia Regni,</hi> according to the
Latin Idiom, and not <hi>Parliamentum,</hi>
which <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia</hi> owns
to be a French Word, and of no great
Antiquity. But that which proves
this Homage to be a Forgery beyond
all Controversy, is the alledged Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of <hi>Margaret</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:52199:16"/>
and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> her Son, <hi>Iune</hi> the
fifth, in the ninth Year of <hi>Malcolm's</hi>
Reign, which must be 1066, for he
began his Reign <hi>April</hi> 25. 1057.
Now <hi>Margaret</hi> and her Brother <hi>Edgar
Atheling,</hi> did not leave <hi>England</hi> till after
the Conquest, which was in <hi>October</hi>
1066. and disigning then for <hi>Hungary,</hi>
they were driven ashore in <hi>Scotland</hi>
by stress of Weather, and there King
<hi>Malcolm</hi> being taken with her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Probity, married her, as near
as we can guess, in 1067: but
that she was not married till she fled
out of <hi>England</hi> after the Conquest,
all the English Historioans that I have
met with agree, and particularly Sir
<hi>William Temple,</hi> in his late Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the History of <hi>England;</hi> so
that here she is supposed to give
Consent to her Husband's doing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to <hi>Edward the Confessor</hi> before
she was married, and when <hi>Edward
the Confessor</hi> was dead: and seeing
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:52199:16"/>
they will have her Son Prince <hi>Edward</hi>
also to sign it, they must at least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him to be fourteen Years of Age
before he was capable of signing a
Deed of this Importance, whereas he
was not then born. These things
appear plain to any Man that will be
at the Pains to look into the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of both Kingdoms, tho I must own
that that Learned Gentleman <hi>Iames
Tyrrel</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> told me of this false Date
before I had seen an authentick Copy
of the pretended Homage; and as
that Gentleman has put a great Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
upon his Country, by assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their antient Liberties in his ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
Book, called <hi>Bibliotheca Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi>
it's not to be doubted but he
will in like manner advance its Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
by refining and improving their
History, without copying the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
cast upon Neighbouring
Nations by the common Herd of
preceding Historians, or robbing
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:52199:17"/>
O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdoms of their due Honour,
<hi>England</hi> having so many real Glories
of her own, that she needs not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave
her Neighbours of any of
theirs; and it's hoped that Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi>
will not disgrace his Treatise of the
publick Leagues and Transactions of
<hi>England,</hi> with such a notorious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terseit
as this appears to be.</p>
            <p>It's but just that we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with some account of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Craig,</hi>
the Author of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Treatise.</p>
            <p>He was lineally descended from
the Family of <hi>Craigston</hi> in <hi>Buc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an,</hi> one
of the most Antient in the Kingdom:
he was born about 1548, and having
been vertuously educated by the Care
of Mr. <hi>Iohn Craig</hi> a great Divine, and
his near Relation, and made more
than an ordinary Progress in the
learned Languages and Philosophy,
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:52199:17"/>
he went to <hi>France,</hi> and studied the
Civil Law: in the Knowledg of
which, he exceeded most of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries;
for he had very great
natural Endowments, as well as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
Parts. On his return from
<hi>France,</hi> he applied himself to the Bar;
where he purchas'd so much Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by his Learning and Integrity,
that in 1604, when K. <hi>Iames</hi> set the
Design of an Union betwixt the two
Kingdoms on foot, he was chosen by
the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> as one of
the principal Commissioners to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
that important Affairs.</p>
            <p>He was universally esteem'd by all
the Great and Learned Men of his
Time; kept Correspondence with
many of them, and particularly with
<hi>Cambden,</hi> that famous Antiquary.</p>
            <p>He gave a convincing Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his extraordinary Knowledg
in the Law, by his Book <hi>de Feudis,</hi> so
well known to all the Learned in
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:52199:18"/>
that Faculty: Wherein, like another
<hi>Iustinian,</hi> he reduc'd into a clear and
intelligible Method the whole Laws
of his Country, which were formerly
like an undigested Chaos, and illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them by the Civil and Canon
Law, and the Customs and Statutes of
various Nations.</p>
            <p>Having thus devoted the first Fruits
of his Pen to the Service of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and the students of the Scots
Law, he persisted in that generous
Course; and undertook the Defence
of his Soveraign's just Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>avils and Objections of
<hi>Dolman,</hi> or rather the Jesuit <hi>Parsons;</hi>
wherein he defeated the bold Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the full Conviction of all Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Men. This valuable Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
is still preserved in the Library
of the College of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> nor would
it have remain'd unprinted, had not
K. <hi>Iames</hi> the Sixth's pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eable Access
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:52199:18"/>
to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> rendred the
Publication of it needless in that Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Zeal for his Prince
and Country, did not stop here; for
the desirable Project of Union ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
warm'd the Breast of that
Learned Monarch, and inspir'd his
Chief Ministers with an earnest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of bringing it about, this
Great Author wrote an excellent
Piece on that subject, entituled, <hi>De
Unione Regnorum;</hi> wherein he has with
all the Strength of Reason, Wit, and
Eloquence, demonstrated the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
and Expediency thereof, though
the bad Genius of the Island hath
hitherto obstructed it. As the first
Effort of his Pen was for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Advantage of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to which he approved himself a
faithful Patriot throughout the whole
Course of his Life; his last Effort
of that Nature was directed to the
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:52199:19"/>
same End, which put him upon wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this learned and Elaborate
Treatise, <hi>De Hominio,</hi> in defence of
the Independency and Soveraignty of
our Kings.</p>
            <p>It is not to be imagin'd but that
this laudable Zeal for his Prince
and Country, was well resented;
and as an Evidence thereof, the King
conferred the Honour of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
upon him, which was recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a considerable Honour in those
times: But this worthy Man being
a Person of substantial Merit, and
one who slighted the gaudy Accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements
of Honour, he could never
be brought to accept of it formally;
upon which the king commanded
that every one should give him the
Title.</p>
            <p>These Instances are sufficient to
demonstrate his Piety towards his
Country; what follows are Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of no less Piety towards his
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:52199:19"/>
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Children, and Hospitality
towards his Neighbours. His Father
being of the Romish Communion,
Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> never desisted from his
pious Endeavours till he brought him
over to the Protestant Religion, which
yielded him no small Joy. His Zeal
for the said Religion, and Fatherly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care
for his Children, appears by his
Will, dated in 1591. about 17 Years
before his Death: Wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
that as he liv'd, so he intended
to die in that Religion which was
at that time professed in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
in all Points and Heads of
Doctrine, which he believed to be
the only true and uncorrupted Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
taught and left to us by Jesus
Christ; and after a very serious Strain
of Practical Devotion, and Provision
made for his lady <hi>Helen Herriot,</hi> a
Daughter of <hi>Trebourn</hi> in <hi>East Lotbian,</hi>
he gave strict Injuctions to his eldest
Son <hi>Lewis,</hi> that as he would inherit
the Blessing of God and his Father,
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:52199:20"/>
he would take a Fatherly-care of the
rest of his Brethren.</p>
            <p>And as he was a dutiful Child him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and eminent for filial Piety, God
rewarded him in that same kind: For
his eldest Son, Sir <hi>Lewis Craig</hi> of
<hi>Wrights-houses,</hi> who attain'd the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
both of a Counsellor and Judg
before he was 34 Years old, which
was a thing very rare in those days,
when few were ever admitted to the
Bench, unless to their other good
Qualifications, they had a long Tract
of Experience adjoin'd; yet this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iful
Son, notwithstanding his high
Station, would always be uncovered
to his excellent Father when he came
to plead before him at the Bar. His
second Son was Sir <hi>Iames Craig</hi> of
<hi>Castle Craig</hi> and <hi>Craigston,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Cavan</hi> and <hi>Letrum,</hi> and Province
of <hi>Ulfter</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
gallantly against the Irish Rebels
in 1641, and dying in defence of his
Country without Issue, left his Estate
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:52199:20"/>
to his younger Brother Dr. <hi>Iohn Craig,</hi>
Physician in Ordinary to K. <hi>Iames</hi> the
Sixth, and afterwards Chief Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
to K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. His fourth Son,
Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> became an Advocate.
And he had moreover, three Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
all of them honourably married;
the eldest <hi>Margaret,</hi> to Sir <hi>Alexander
Gibson</hi> of <hi>Dury;</hi> the second <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
to Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi> Father to Sir <hi>Archibald</hi>
the late Lord <hi>Wariston,</hi> and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
to Mr. <hi>Iohnston,</hi> one of his
Majesty's Secretaries of State for the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> the youngest
<hi>Ianet,</hi> was married to ... <hi>Belchis</hi>
of <hi>Tofts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then as for his Hospitality towards
his Neighbours; it was evidenc'd by
his keeping an open Table to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
remarkable for their Birth or
Learning. And thus having mov'd
in an high Sphere of Reputation till
the <hi>60th</hi> Year of his Age, he died at
<hi>Edinburgh, Ann. Dom.</hi> 1608. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Representative of his Family, is
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:52199:21"/>
               <hi>Robert Craig</hi> of <hi>Riccarton;</hi> who tho'
he has an opulent Estate if 1200 <hi>l.
per annum,</hi> yet follows the law after
the Example of his Predecessors.</p>
            <p>As for the Translation, all that can
be said for it is this, that part of it
was shown to some of good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before it went to the Press, who
were pleas'd to approve of it. It's
but seldom that Originals gain any
thing by Translations; and it is not to
be supposed that the Publisher's Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
should come any thing near the
Author's Latin, of which he was
known to be so great a Master; but
Care has been taken to express his
Sense as far as the translator's Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
could reach it; and he hopes that
some Allowances may be granted
him though the Stile be not found
very smooth and equal, seeing the
Nature of the Debate would scarcely
admit of it.</p>

            <p>THere are some few Dates and Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
on the Margin left out,
because wanting in the Latin Manuscript,
as <hi>Page</hi> 83, and 144. The Transcriber,
though a good Penman, yet hath neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
Latin nor History well, nor was his
Copy ever perus'd by the Author. However,
it's hop'd that no important Mistake hath
escap'd; but if any Gentleman be so kind as
to impart what he discovers to the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller,
they shall be fairly considered if ever
we come to a Second Edition; and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript
in the Lawyers Library at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
shall be consulted, which the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher
knew nothing of till this was translated.
There are also some Latin Verses and
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:52199:22"/>
Terms of Art, which it was thought advisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to exhibit without Translation, as tending
more to the Embellishment of the Discourse
than any way needful; and the Verses espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
would have sounded harsh in English,
except they had been turn'd into English
Metre with a Flame equal to that of the
Original: But the Learned know them,
and for others they will understand the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
as well without them. The Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator
begs a favourable Censure, as having
undertaken it for the Honour of his Country,
and committed no wilful Mistake. The Latin
Manuscript may he seen by those who have a
mind to it, at the Book seller's.</p>

               <p>ABOVE two Years ago, I undertook
a Treatise of the <hi>Manner of Fees;</hi>
not that I conceiv'd my self capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of giving any new Light, or
adding any fresh Lustre to the <hi>Feudal Law,</hi>
after the Endeavours of so many Learned
Men on that Subject; but because, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to all Men, the Laws of our Country
do flow from thence, as from their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and have a Dependance on the Rules
and Maxims thereof. But the Mind of Man
being naturally desirous of farther Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
I began likewise to enquire into the
Laws of our Neighbours, to see if there
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52199:26"/>
might not be also some Assinity betwixt theirs
and the <hi>Feudal Law:</hi> for I perceived that
our Law agreed with that of <hi>England,</hi> and
that the Customs of both Nations di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the English will not own so much, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

that they use no other Laws than thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> own,
<hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Municipal Law.</hi> Yet I was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
from pursuing my Design, because
I had but little Knowledg in that sort of
Law my self, and knew not of any Man who
could assist me. However, I did not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the Enterprize, as hoping to meet with
that in Books, which was not to be met
with elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Having therefore taken care to provide
my self with some Books, and enquired di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently

But it happened far otherwise, for <hi>Joannes

into that same Error by reading the English

                  <hi>Liege-Lord;</hi> but they have now
forborn doing so for about three hundred
Years. And <hi>Bernard Gerard</hi> a Modern
French Historian, in <hi>Philippo 1. Lib.</hi> 7. as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
<hi>that</hi> Scotland <hi>is a Fee-Liege of</hi> England,
<hi>although the Scots do at this time deny it; and</hi>
both those Authors are very Learned Men,
though unacquainted with our Affairs. And
therefore lest by this Silence of ours, the
Error should spread further, I resolved to
obviate the growing Distemper, by some
healthful Antidote, and to examine all the
particulars of this Controversy with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Diligence. <hi>Holinshed</hi> might indeed be
born with, if contenting himself with his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52199:27"/>
Argument, he had abstain'd from ill Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
but in his Satyrical Invective, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what he says of our Poverty and Want,
he upbraids us continually with Sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Persidy, which by his leave, are
Crimes that may as justly be charg'd upon
others. But seeing he has perhaps some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to charge us with Poverty,
<q>Leniter ex merito quicquid patiare ferendum est;</q>
we can patiently bear what we deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
suffer; for we may want Riches
without being criminal or justly reproach'd
for our Poverty, and others may enjoy them
without any great Credit: So that I may
say with <hi>Tacitus, I know not whether the Gods
have withheld Riches from us out of Love or
Anger;</hi> seeing it's possible as <hi>Horace</hi> says,
<q>
                     <l>—Sub paupere tecto</l>

That Men of greater worth than Kings or
Courtiers may live in mean Cottages. But
no Man can own himself Vicious, without
being content at the same Time to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
Infamous; and notwithstanding all
this, our Condition is such, that our Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is no way burdensome to us, nor have
we any occasion to beg greater Riches from
our Neighbours. And as for our Cowardice
and Persidy, we shall treat of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>

               <p>To prove this Homage, the common sort

of <hi>Huntington, Matthew Paris, Matthew</hi>
of <hi>Westminster, Roger Hovedon, Florence</hi>
of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Walsingham,</hi> all
Monks: But they content themselves with
the bare Assertion of this Homage's having
been paid, and touch it but briefly in the
Course of their History. But others carry it
further, and laying aside all Modesty, affirm,
that this Homage was paid for <hi>Scotland;</hi>
though those are indeed but few, nor do they
assert that it was ever done above once or
twice. But they who professedly handled
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52199:29"/>
this Question, were two Kings, both of
them of great Fame and Repute, <hi>Edward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi>
and <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. the former when sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. for haras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Scots with an unjust War, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that Superiority over them which
he had feigned to himself by an Erroneous
Opinion, did for his own Vindication al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
many Reasons, some of which were
feign'd, and others of them made nothing
to his purpose of proving that Superiority
which he claim'd over <hi>Scotland.</hi> But <hi>Henry</hi>
VIII. seeking for an occasion of War against
King <hi>Iames</hi> V. of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did at last pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this for one, that he would recover by
Force of Arms, the Right of Superiority that
the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had over <hi>Scotland,</hi> but
which his Ancestors had neglected; though
we all know that there was another cause
of that War, which is also own'd in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Declaration: For <hi>Iames</hi> V.
having promised to meet his Uncle at <hi>York,</hi>
that they might consult together about the
Conjunction of the Kingdoms, and what
might be for their mutual Advantage; he
was at last compelled to break the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by the Authority of the Pope and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
who then made no small Figure in the
Kingdom, and were afraid lest that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
should have issued in a Reformation.
<hi>Henry</hi> VIII. being a Magnanimous Prince,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52199:29"/>
provoked by this Aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ont, and unwilling to
bear it, thought the Breach of the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not to be a sufficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ause of War,
and therefore founded it upon the Pretext
of regaining the former Superiority, which
gave rise to that called the <hi>nine Years War,</hi>
famous for Mutual Overthrows, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Scots did indeed suffer most. Both
those two Potent Kings above-mentioned,
the one in his Apology to the Pope, and
the other in his Declaration of War, do most
tenaciously assert this Homage to be due from
the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi>
but with more Confidence than Reason; and
after them it is asserted by <hi>Iohn Leland,</hi>
who was supposed to have been the Author
of that Declaration. And <hi>Holinshed</hi> musters
all their Arguments together, but thinking
them either insufficient of themselves, or
at least having a Mind to show the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his own Parts, and the Force of his
Pen; he adds many things of his own Head,
wrests many things which he finds in other
Authors, feigns abundance as if they were
made before-hand, and ascribes many things
to other Authors which they never so much
as once thought of. But,
<q>
                     <l>Improvisum aspris veluti qui sentibus anguem</l>

he pretends only to repeat, without adding
any thing of his own. But <hi>Holinshed</hi> ought
to have remembred that he is no less a Cheat
who makes use of Counterfeit Writings, than
he who writes them himself; nor is he an
honester Man who puts off false Money,
than he that coins it. For my own part,
in refuting of <hi>Holinshed,</hi> whom I chuse to
answer instead of all the rest, because he hath
collected all their Arguments together, I
shall only say by way of Preface, that I will
bring nothing to strengthen our Plea from
any Scots Author, but what I design to
prove, I take from English Monuments and
Histories, except when the plain Truth of
the History is industriously perverted by this
Man; and in that Case I am sometimes forc'd
to bring things from our own Writers, to
give Light to the Point of History: And as
I doubt not to make this Author's Malice
and Ignorance appear to the View of the
World, neither do I refuse any Man for a

               <head type="sub">The Definition and Form of Homage.</head>
               <p>THE State of the Question is this,
<hi>Whether the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland <hi>be a
Fee-Liege of the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>and
whether the King of</hi> Scotland <hi>owes, or ever
did pay Homage to the King of</hi> England <hi>upon
that Account.</hi> The Affirmative is stifly
maintain'd by all the English. The Scots
not contenting themselves with the bare Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
though that be sufficient in Law,
without any thing else, so long as the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs
don't prove their Point, have both
their own Arguments, the likelihood of
things past, and also the Presumption of Law
on their side, seeing they have been in Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of their Liberty now for three Ages,
even by the Confession of the English them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and therefore except the Plaintiffs do
clearly make good their Plea, they must of
necessity yield the Cause. But that we may
not proceed in unknown Paths, we must
enquire what this <hi>Homage</hi> is, whence it had
its Rise, what is its Form, and when it came
first in Use.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Homage</hi> then is a <hi>Profession of Fealty,
which the Vassal is obliged to make unto his Lord
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52199:31"/>
by Oath, upon the Account of some Benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
If we examine the Terms of this
Definition, it will appear that <hi>Homage</hi> and
<hi>Fealty</hi> are not the same: For <hi>Fealty</hi> is owing
during Life, but <hi>Homage</hi> is only perform'd
once; Neither is there any Author, who
mentions the Swearing of <hi>Fealty</hi> oftener
than once, during the Life of the Lord or
Vassal. It is said also in the Definition [<hi>which
the Vassal is obliged to make unto his Lord</hi>] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is a certain <hi>Neighbourly Fealty,</hi>
when Men are bound to one another by Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Oath and Covenant; but this is not the
<hi>Fealty</hi> here mentioned, that being only such
whereby the Vassal is obliged to defend the
Person, Fame, Dignity, and Fortune of his
Lord, and to procure and promote his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
as much as he can. Nor is this a
simple Obligation, but there is a Cause an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd,
<hi>viz. on the Account of a Benefit receiv'd;</hi>
so that tho there should happen an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to <hi>Fealty</hi> by an Oath, except the Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
receive a Benefit from the Lord upon
that Account, it is not called <hi>Homage,</hi> For
those things, as I said, are Relatives, and the
one cannot be understood without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I mean a <hi>Fee,</hi> or <hi>Benefit</hi> and <hi>Homage:</hi>
for neither can there be a <hi>Fee</hi> without <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>
and the Profession of it, nor <hi>Homage</hi>
without an Antecedent Benefit. I said <hi>a
Profession of Fealty by Oath,</hi> because a simple
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52199:31"/>
Promise was not sufficient, and therefore
the Interposition of an Oath was necessary,
for without that, it is not call'd <hi>Homage,</hi>
although the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Obligation of <hi>Fealty</hi> be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.
There was a double Form of
Oath us'd formerly in <hi>Fees,</hi> and I shall by
and by exhibit that which is in Practice now.</p>
               <p>The Etymology of this Word is easy; for
<hi>Hominium</hi> or <hi>Homagium,</hi> is the Action or
Profession of a Man: and the Doing of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
is no other <hi>than a Man's Professing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be his Lord's Man, and Promising to
perfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his Military Service faithfully when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and sometimes also when he is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</hi>
for it is Fidelity alone which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
and required in those Feudal Actions.</p>
               <p>I know that most Learned Men are of a
different Opinion, and distinguish <hi>Homage</hi>
from <hi>Fealty</hi> thus; that the former is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
with more Veneration than the latter,
that so they may make the Oath of <hi>Homage</hi>
distinct from that of <hi>Fealty;</hi> and thus they
require two Oaths, whereas there is only
one needful in Law. But by their leave I
make bold to say, it is not so; for there was
only one Oath, the Form of which was two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
in Law, and we don't read that any
Man did ever in that Case take two Oaths.
I confess indeed, that among different Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
this Oath was differently administred,
in some with more, and in others with less
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52199:32"/>
Veneration, but so as it was always perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with Reverence. For <hi>Rollo</hi> D. of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>

               <head type="sub">At what time Homage began to be known in the
World.</head>
               <p>TO return to my purpose, and that the
whole Matter may be set in a due
Light, I shall premise four or five general
Propositions, that by considering them and
the Arguments brought in this Answer, the
Truth of the whole Question may appear
even to the most unlearned, and afterwards
I shall take <hi>Holinshed's</hi> Arguments and Proofs
to task.</p>
               <p>Then let this be laid down as the first Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Proposition and Rule, That before
<hi>Charlemain's</hi> Time, or the Year of Christ 800,
the Name of Fee-Liege, Homage or Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
were unknown to the World; and
<hi>Peter Rebuff</hi> a most acute Lawyer, in his
Declaration of Fees, says, that the very
Name of Fee or Feu was unknown, until
the Books concerning the use of Fees were
publish'd, which happened in 1170. But
his Opinion does not at all please me, for
although the Name did not come to us before
the publishing of those Books, I am of the
Mind, that it was of an older Date, first,
amongst the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and then in <hi>France:</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52199:34"/>
for <hi>Charles</hi> the Great after he had put an end
to his many great and important Wars, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Old, began to distribute the Countries
which he had conquered amongst his deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Souldiers; to one a Country, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Town, to a Third a Farm, reserving
to himself a Claim of <hi>Fealty;</hi> and they were
to maintain the Charge of the War by their
Product, and to take care that the Product
might be sufficient for that end, and thus it
came on by Degrees: but the Names of
<hi>Clients, Vassals,</hi> and those of an inferior Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as <hi>Vavasors</hi> and <hi>Vavasins,</hi> were scarcely
heard of in this Age; nor before those
Times, that is to say, about the Year 900,
is there any Writer who mentions the
Names either of <hi>Fee, Vassal</hi> or <hi>Homage</hi>

<hi>Hugh Capet's</hi> Time, who that he might
oblige the Nobility of the Kingdom which
he had usurp'd, and assure himself of them
for Time to come, made those Temporary
Benefits which <hi>Charles</hi> and his Successors had
granted only for a Time, or at most for Life,
hereditary to his own Followers, and then
<hi>Homage</hi> began to come in use, and at that
time the Names and Foundations of <hi>Lords,
Vassals,</hi> and of <hi>Fee</hi> it self, which <hi>Charlemain</hi>
had laid, were confirm'd; and this <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi>

                  </gap>
before this Feudal Law and those Names
came hither, and that only from <hi>France</hi>
and along with the Conqueror, as I am apt
to conjecture; yet our Authors alledg that
<hi>Homage</hi> was first mention'd in <hi>Athelstan's</hi>
Reign: But the Antient English Laws be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Time, which were printed at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>

and if the English have any thing
which they can produce for themselves, or
in Confirmation of their Opinion, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
them to name me any one Writer, who
before that time makes the least mention of
<hi>Fee</hi> or <hi>Homage.</hi> I take no notice, as I told
them, of the mention of <hi>Fealty,</hi> since that may
be neighbourly, and us'd amongst Friends
and Confederates, neither indeed will they
find it mentioned in that sense; and if the
Names of <hi>Fee</hi> and <hi>Homage</hi> were not known
to the World till that Time, with what
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52199:35"/>
Countenance can the English Writers, and
chiefly <hi>Holinshed,</hi> affirm, that <hi>Brutus</hi> divided
the Island of <hi>Britain,</hi> which was so call'd
from himself, amongst his three Sons, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crinus,
Camber</hi> and <hi>Albanactus,</hi> but reserv'd
the <hi>Superiority</hi> of the whole to his first born
<hi>Locrinus,</hi> seeing the Names of <hi>Superiority,
Fee,</hi> or <hi>Homage,</hi> were not publickly used for
900 Years or more after Christ, nor for any
thing I know read in any Author before
that Time? <hi>Brutus</hi> was before <hi>Charlemain</hi>
almost 2000 Years, and therefore to ascribe
that to <hi>Brutus,</hi> which had not a Being in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
till almost 2000 Years after him, is
perfectly to impose upon Mankind. If in
<hi>Iustinian</hi>'s Time, which was about the Year
500, there had been any mention of <hi>Homage,
Superiority</hi> or <hi>Fee,</hi> it would never have been
omitted by the famous Lawyers of that Age.
As for that fictitious History of <hi>Brutus,</hi> it is
exposed to ridicule and hissing by our <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan;</hi>
and that I may speak softly for fear of
offending those that hear me, it is esteem'd
a Milesian Fable by <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> a most
Learned English Historian, and therefore he
calls it a new History lately dropt down
from the Clouds, and unknown to all the
Antients till <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth's</hi> Time, of
whom afterwards.</p>

               <p>THE second Proposition is this, That
before the departure of <hi>Aetius</hi> the
Roman Legat from the Province of <hi>Britain,</hi>
which happened in the Time of <hi>Arcadius</hi>
and <hi>Honorius,</hi> there was no King over all that

nay, I affirm, that even after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
there was no certain nor stable Form
of a Kingdom in the same, until the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of the Saxon Heptarchy, which
fell out about 835, in the Time of King
<hi>Egbert;</hi> and what Reasons I have for this
Assertion, I shall by and by declare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> (whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> deservedly
calls a very great Author) was the first who
entred <hi>Britain;</hi> and as a Person who loved
Glory, and that he might not be any way
wanting to himself on that Head, he testifies
that he had search'd diligently into the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of the Nation which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
but could never find by what or
how great People it was inhabited, nor learn
their manner of War, or by what Customs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52199:36"/>
they liv'd<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 4. of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries.</note>: and afterwards he asserts, that
the innermost Parts of the Island were inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by those who call themselves Natives
by Tradition, but the Maritime Places were
Possessed by those who had come over from
<hi>Belgium,</hi> either to make War or get Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 5. of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note>.
So that if either <hi>Cassibelan</hi> or <hi>Cassiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or any other had at that Time govern'd all
<hi>Britain,</hi> as is feign'd by those Trifle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, <hi>Caesar</hi>
would never have omitted it, because it had
been more for his Fame and Glory to have
fought with the Monarch of all <hi>Britain,</hi>
than with the petty Princes of one Town or
Province, or at least he would have some
where made mention of this Monarch of all
<hi>Britain.</hi> But <hi>Caesar</hi> speaks of four Kings in
<hi>Kent</hi> it self, which is but a Corner of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and besides those he mentions King
<hi>Imanuentius,</hi> and <hi>Mandubratius,</hi> and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
every City had its own King, of whom
most part sent Ambassadors to him for Peace
before he came over, than which there can
be nothing more contradictory to <hi>Britain's</hi>
being then one entire Kingdom. And <hi>Caesar</hi>
himself makes no mention of <hi>Cass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>belan,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in his second Expedition, neither does
he then dignify him with the Title of King:
He does also take notice of his having made
continual War with other Cities before his
Arrival, and describes his Boundaries. Nay,
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a King, but General of the Army, and
says, that he only commanded over one
City which was taken by <hi>Caesar.</hi> However
it appears from both Histories, that he was a
prudent Person, and entrusted with the
Management of the War against the Romans
by the other Cities and petty Princes. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
in the Life of <hi>Iulius Agricola,</hi> who also
was his Father-in-Law, and went to and again
through the Heart of <hi>Britain</hi> for eight Years
Time together with his Forces, and could not
possibly be ignorant of the Truth, does yet
more plainly make for us. <hi>Of old,</hi> says he,
<hi>before the Arrival of the Dictator, the</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<hi>were govern'd by Kings, but now they
are broken into Factions and Parties by their
Princes; nor is there any thing of more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to us against those most valiant Nations, than
that they don't consult together: for the Union
of two or three Cities to withstand the common
Danger is very Rare, so that while they fight
singly, all of them are conquered.</hi> But if any
one King had been set over them all, he
might both have obliged them to hold pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Meetings to withstand the common
Danger, and have prevented the fighting of
single Cities by themselves. And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he adds, <hi>When the</hi> Britains <hi>bewail their
Servit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

now they have two impos'd over them,</hi> viz. the LE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GAT
<hi>who preys on their Lives, and the PROCTOR
or Questor who seizes their Estates.</hi> These
things sufficiently prove, there was not any
one Man who at that time commanded over
all <hi>Britain,</hi> but that their condition was the
same with their neighbouring Country of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> which <hi>Tacitus</hi> affirms to have been
then also govern'd by many little Princes, as
it was by five Kings when it submitted to the
English. If in <hi>Kent</hi> alone there were four
Kings, how many must we allow to all <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?</hi>
for both the <hi>Silures</hi> and the <hi>Brigantes</hi>
had their own Kings, as appears from <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi>
and <hi>Claudius Caesar</hi> triumph'd over <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
King of <hi>Orkney.</hi> In <hi>France</hi> there were
as many Kings as Provinces, as is manifest

the whole. What is writ concerning <hi>Lucius</hi>
King of the <hi>Brittons</hi> or <hi>Britains,</hi> that he
was the first who embraced the Christian
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52199:37"/>
Religion, I am of Opinion, that he was not
a <hi>Britain,</hi> or at least not King of all <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and that that Epistle of Pope <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
to <hi>Lucius</hi> is a Counterfeit; for none of
the Roman Pontiss, either at that Time or
for some Ages after, before the Emperor
<hi>Phocas</hi> who reign'd in 602, did ever arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Name of Pope to themselves; and
the very Name <hi>Lucius</hi> is a Roman, not a
<hi>British</hi> Name. It's certain that none of the
Antients except <hi>Bede,</hi> make any mention
of this <hi>Lucius,</hi> and neither does his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
agree with the true Chronology;
for that Epistle of <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> printed at
<hi>London,</hi> bears date in the Year of Christ
169, at which Time <hi>Eleutherius</hi> was not
Bishop or Pontif of <hi>Rome:</hi> but according
to <hi>Bede,</hi> those things were transacted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> in the Year 156,
and so there is the Difference of thirteen
Years betwixt the Calculations. To which
may be added, that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> in his Epistle
takes notice, that <hi>Lucius</hi> and the Nobles of
<hi>Britain</hi> desired that he would transmit the
Roman Laws to them, that they might
make use of them; but this is not very
probable that any Nation would have born
with the change of their Antient Laws:
and moreover, when that Letter was writ,
<hi>Britain</hi> was a Roman Province, and from
the Time that it became such, which was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52199:38"/>
140 Years before, had already received the
Roman Laws: for the Romans imposed
their own Laws upon their Provinces, and
abolish'd their former Institutions. I shall
only bring one Example from <hi>Caesar.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 7.</note>
where <hi>Critognatus</hi> aggravating the severity
of the Roman Government, says, if those
things which are done in remote Nations
be not known, look but into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Country of <hi>Gallia,</hi> which being
reduced to a Province, their Laws and
Customs are chang'd, they are subjected to
Roman Officers, and oppress'd with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Servitude. But let us consider what
<hi>Eleutherius</hi> answers, he says, that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in his Power to reject the Roman and
Imperial Laws: Now if this could be born
with in him who was a Roman Subject,
and also a Christian Bishop, let others judg;
certainly his calling <hi>Lucius</hi> God's Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in his own Kingdom, does not agree
well with the Roman Authority, of which
be ought to have been very tenacious. There
are some places of Scripture mentioned in
that Epistle, which are not very well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
to the Matter in Hand; and in fine,
the whole Letter savours nothing of the
Learning of that Age. These are the Things
which occasion my doubts of the Truth of
that Epistle; neither is <hi>Bede</hi> a sufficient
Witness for things done 600 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52199:38"/>
his Time. Yet it may be that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
then suffered some petty Princes to
enjoy the Royal Name, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> writes
concerning King <hi>Cogidunus,</hi> who he affirms
was left King by the Romans, not to
govern, but that according to the antient
and long received Custom of the Romans,
they might have Instruments of Servitude,
and amongst those Kings as well as others.
Moreover, in what part of <hi>Britain</hi> this <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
did reign, or how far his Command ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
Writers don't say, nor does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more that he was King of <hi>Britain,</hi> than
that he was King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was then
part of <hi>Britain:</hi> and therefore it's plain
that the Romans had petty Princes in this
Island, who might serve them as Instruments
of Servitude; but there was no Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with the Government of the whole
Island, or that had Authority to assemble
the People.</p>

                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> says, that <hi>Caratacus</hi> and <hi>Galganus</hi>
were Generals who excell'd in Nobility and
Power, yet does not give them the Name
of Kings, except that in one place he calls
<hi>Caratacus</hi> King of the <hi>Silures,</hi> but not King
of <hi>Britain,</hi> as <hi>Cartismandua</hi> reign'd over
the <hi>Brigantes;</hi> but from both of them it's
apparent enough that the <hi>Brigantes, Silu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
and <hi>Iugani</hi> had each of them their own
Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52199:39"/>But that this whole Matter may be the
more easily understood; let us examine
what was the Roman way of governing a
Province, and at what time <hi>Britain</hi> became
a Roman Province. As to their way of
Government, it is certain, that when the
Romans had subdued a Country, they us'd
to exauctorate the former Magistrates, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Country into the Form of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and substitute new Roman Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
<hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>etor</hi> and <hi>Questor,</hi> the
one to administer Justice to those of the
Province, and command the Army, and the
other to gather in the Tribute; so that
there was no Province which did not pay
Tribute to the Romans, and obey their
Magistrates, except that some Cities, for
their former Services to them, were exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Taxes and Tributes, and left in
the Enjoyment of their Antient Laws:
And so it was as to Kings, whose Realms
they us'd to leave free on that same Account,
and then they were called the <hi>Roman Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates:</hi>
for as <hi>Caesar</hi> testifies elsewhere, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
overcame the <hi>Arverni</hi> and <hi>Rhuteni;</hi> but
the Romans pardon'd them, and did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them into the Form of a Province.
But when either a Country or Kingdom
was reduc'd into a Province, first they took
away their Kings, that they might have no
General to head a Rebellion, then they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52199:39"/>
a <hi>Praetor</hi> or <hi>Praeses,</hi> who had the
sole Command; his Badges were six Fasces,
or Bundles of Rods, with Axes; and Lictors,
or Serjeants went before him: The <hi>Praetor</hi>
summon'd Courts and Conventions, decided
private Causes, or delegated others to do it;
he commanded the Army which was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
him for Defence of the Province,
rais'd new Troops, casheer'd others, and
had the Administration of all things relating
to Peace and War. The <hi>Questor</hi> was over
the Tribute, Imposts and Customs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Money or Provisions, and kept the
Publick Accounts, as I formerly observed
from <hi>Tacitus:</hi> Neither was there any thing
more unusual in a Province than a King,
nor a greater sign of Rebellion, than for
those of a Province to set a King over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as we shall afterwards show in <hi>Caran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
Nor could those of a Province obey
a Roman Legat and a King at the same
time, for the Power of the one did wholly
abolish the Power of the other; for of
what use could a King be without Power or
Command, Army, Jurisdiction, Tribute,
Customs, or Authority over the Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als?
Nor is it likely that the King would
obey the Legat, who was at that time his
Superior, or that the Legat would obey the
King. Those who would inform themselves
further concerning the Antient Law of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52199:40"/>
Provinces, may read <hi>Charles Sigoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hath published a particular Treatise on that
Subject, and they will find that I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
nothing but Truth.</p>
               <p>It remains that I show at what time <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
was reduc'd into a Roman Province.
Some ascribe it to <hi>Caesar</hi> the <hi>Dictator,</hi> as the
first who subdued <hi>Britain</hi> by Arms, made
it Tributary to the Romans, and demanded
Hostages: Yet seeing he did not enter into
the furthermost Parts of the Island, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
again to <hi>France,</hi> he seems rather to
have pointed out than subdued <hi>Britain</hi> for
his Successors. <hi>Tacitus</hi> says, That Legions
and Auxiliaries were brought over by <hi>Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
and that then the People were subdued,
their Kings made Captives; and the first
Consulat establish'd in the Person of <hi>A. Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

140 Years before the Reign of this
<hi>Lucius.</hi> So that it seems altogether mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
to imagine, that the <hi>Britains</hi> enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their own Laws and Kings in the Time
of <hi>Eleutherius;</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> sets down the
Number of the other Governours of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
to his own Time, that is to say, till
<hi>Domitian</hi>'s Reign. Certainly <hi>Claudius</hi> did
so please himself with this Conquest, that
he led the <hi>British</hi> Kings in Triumph, and
took care to have his Son saluted by the
Name of <hi>Britanni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns.</hi> I have perhaps been
too prolix upon those Things, but I was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52199:40"/>
willing to undeceive our Neighbours as to
their Opinion, that <hi>Britain,</hi> though reduc'd
to the Form of a Province, enjoy'd its own
Laws and Kings, who were, according to
this vain Conceit, endowed with Soveraign
Authority; and therefore I conclude it to
be highly improbable, that during the
Time of the Romans in this Island, any one
King had the Government of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<hi>Britains. Gildas,</hi> whose Credit is most
esteem'd by <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Bede,</hi> the one
a <hi>Britain,</hi> and the other an Englishman, are
very full in their Evidence for this Matter;
for <hi>Gildas</hi> affirms, that the British Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was administred by their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
before the coming of the Romans,
but makes no mention of any Kings. Next,
he says, that the Island was govern'd by the
Romans, whom he calls <hi>Transmarine Kings;</hi>
and blaming the Cowardice of the <hi>Britains,</hi>
he says, that the Romans brought Laws into
the Island, and subdued the unwarlike and
perfidious Nation, not so much by Arms
and Engines, as they did others, but by meer
Threatnings and Menaces of Punishment;
and he describes their Cowardliness so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically,
that he says, the Romans at their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, set some of the Natives over them,
who to use his own Words, <hi>were to make
the Whip cleave to their Backs, and the Yoke
to their Necks,</hi> that so they might chastise
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52199:41"/>
the deceitful Nation; not so much by Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Force, as by Rods. <hi>Bede</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that <hi>Britain</hi> was unknown and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible
to the Romans before <hi>Caius Caesar's</hi>
Time: so that neither while the Roman
Empire stood, nor before <hi>Caesar,</hi> was there
any King over all <hi>Britain,</hi> or any who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
that part of it, which was not subject
to the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts. Bede</hi> writes, that
the Romans reign'd in <hi>Britain</hi> 470 Years,
from the Time that <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> entred the
Island; but that any other reign'd in their
Province during that Time, there's no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Reason to be alledged for it. But
when the Roman Power declin'd, and that
the <hi>Britains</hi> were not able of themselves to
withstand the Invasions of the <hi>Scots</hi> and
<hi>Picts,</hi> they begg'd Assistance from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
with lamentable Complaints, but in
vain. So that being rejected, they chose,
in a tumultuary manner, one of the Antient
British Blood named <hi>Vortigern,</hi> whom they
called <hi>Captain,</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> for I find him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
both those Titles; and after him <hi>Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Ambrosius,</hi> who was the only One of the
Roman Stock left in <hi>Britain. Vortigern</hi>
perceiving that he had not Strength enough
of his own to oppose his Enemies, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
the <hi>Britains,</hi> who were then at a
Consult about their Common Safety, to hire
Saxon Auxiliaries, which issued in their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52199:41"/>
Destruction; for when the Saxons, who
came at first only with three Ships, observ'd
the Fruitfulness of the Island, and the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
Temper of the Inhabitants, a greater
Number followed in 35 Ships, turn'd their
Arms against the <hi>Britains,</hi> and divided all
<hi>Britain</hi> into seven, some say nine King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
amongst themselves; From that Time,
which was in the Year of Christ 456, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to others, 459, that <hi>Hengist</hi> arriv'd
in <hi>Britain,</hi> until King <hi>Egbert's</hi> Reign, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whom the seven Kingdoms were United,
It's certain, that there was no King who
reign'd over all <hi>Britain;</hi> for what's writ of
King <hi>Constantine,</hi> and the Auxiliaries which
came from <hi>Britany</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> are meer Fables:
Nor does <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Gildas,</hi> the Historians of
those Times, make any mention of them.
But to what End is all this Discourse, may
some say? Or what relation have those
things to the Homage which was owing, and
perform'd by the Kings of <hi>Scots?</hi> I answer,
very much; for if there was not at that
Time one King over that Part of <hi>Britain,</hi>
which was a Roman Province, but either
none at all, or more than one, it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
make out what we affirm, <hi>viz.</hi> that
there was no Homage due, during that tract
of Time, from the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> seeing
there was no other to whom it could be due,
nor no Fealty sworn, when there was none
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52199:42"/>
to whom it could be sworn; for to suppose
that it was perform'd to all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is absurd. But if any Body object, that
by this Proposition I derogate from the
Credit of the whole English History, I
would pray him to suspend his Judgment,
until he hath also perus'd the following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and compar'd it with that which
went before.</p>

               <p>THIS is the third Proposition; That
most of what we find in the English
History before the Conquest is vain and
trifling, and almost all of it uncertain, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
what is writ by the Roman Historians,

For the Original of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the first
Transactions of the Inhabitants, lies buried
in a greater obscurity than that of the <hi>Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merian</hi>
Darkness. <hi>Caesar</hi> testifies, that there
were no Monuments, nor Memorials of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52199:42"/>
in that part of <hi>Britain</hi> which he
saw, though it was the chief Part then, as
it is still, both for the Number and Wealth
of the Inhabitants. But amongst those
who inhabited the Inland Parts, and were
nothing so cultivate, it was far less to be
expected: so that when he enquired at them,
concerning the Original of their Nation,
and the first Inhabitants of the Island; he
tells us, that he could learn nothing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 4. <hi>and</hi> 5.</note>.
But <hi>Tacitus</hi>

<hi>Agricola</hi> entred into the innermost
Parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> search'd it thorowly for
eight Years Time, and from whom nothing
could be hid, because of his Authority) is
more express for us; and says, that as to
what sort of People did first possess <hi>Britain,</hi>
the Inhabitants, like other Barbarians, could
give but very little Account. Who then
can bear with <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> a most
impertinent Trifler, as the English them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
call him; who forms such a distinct
Story concerning <hi>Brutus</hi> his Grand-father,
Great-grand-fathers, Son's Mother and Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring,
and in a word, his whole Pedigree,
and describes their Names, Affairs, Life and
Death, though above twenty Ages before
himself, as accurately as if he had been their
Fellow-Citizen, or writ his History in their
own Time; though he did not begin the
same until the Year 1150, or thereabouts?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52199:43"/>
And whereas <hi>Caesar</hi> testifies, that there were
no Memorials of things past kept in <hi>Britain;</hi>
and that the Antiquity of that Nation was
altogether unknown: Yet <hi>Geffrey</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 1.</note> relates,
that when <hi>Caesar</hi> came to the opposite Shore
of the <hi>Morini,</hi> saw the Island, ask'd who
the Inhabitants were, and understood the
Name of the Kingdom and People, by <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi>
says he, they the <hi>Britains,</hi> and we
Romans, are of the same Original. For
<hi>Aeneas</hi> after the Destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> was
our Founder; and <hi>Brutus</hi> begotten by <hi>Silvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
Son to <hi>Ascanius,</hi> and Grandson to <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
was theirs; but certainly they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Warfare: and abundance more
which deserves rather to be entertain'd with
Laughter and Scorn than confuted, seeing
they do so plainly contradict <hi>Caesar</hi>'s own
words. I submit it then to the Judgment of
the Candid Reader, what Evidence either
the <hi>Britains</hi> or English can produce for those
things. It is certain that there can be no
preservation of the Memory of things past,
nor continuation of the remembrance of
things present, without the help of Letters,
seeing the Memory of Man is terminated by
the space of one Age. But it is evident from
<hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>itus,</hi> that there was no use of Letters in

the Time of his Father-in-Law <hi>Iulius Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola,</hi>
who was <hi>Domit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>an</hi>'s Legat in <hi>Britain,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52199:43"/>
the British Youth began to be instructed
in Roman Letters, (as the <hi>Americans</hi> are now
by the Assistance of the Spaniards) that
they excell'd in the same, and that <hi>Agricola</hi>
used to prefer their Wits to those of the
<hi>Gauls,</hi> because they studied Eloquence: and
therefore before that time, <hi>viz.</hi> the Year of
Christ 83, when <hi>Domitian</hi> began to reign,
it's apparent enough, that there were no
Letters nor Memorials of things past in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
But some may object, that although
the Romans wrote nothing concerning Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Affairs, yet there were many British
Writers, who it's probable would not have
left themselves destitute of some Monuments
or Memorials of their own Affairs: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
how could they continue their Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or by what Characters did they write it;
for the Latin Letters had not then reach'd
them, and they were ignorant of the Greek
for many Ages after. But <hi>Gildas</hi> shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
this Question for me, who is the eldest
of all the British Writers, was born in 498,
three Years before <hi>Arthur</hi> if there was any
such Person; and wrote about 540, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Ruin and Dissolution of the British
Kingdom: and when he bewails the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of his Country by the Saxons, he
testifies, that there were no Monuments of
the British Writers left, or if there were
any, that they were either burnt by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52199:44"/>
or dispers'd and lost by the Exile of
his Countrymen, so that there were none of
them to be seen in his Time: Here he plainly
distinguishes betwixt these two, either that
the British Historians left no Monuments
behind them, which is most likely, or that
they were destroyed by the Fury of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
Whence then can those numerous
Victories, and illustrious Actions of the
<hi>Britains</hi> be instructed, when all Authors do
unanimously call them a cowardly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
Nation? I believe that it happened
to them as it did to the Holy Relicks, for
about 1000 Years after Christ's Passion, all
the Parts of the Cross on which he suffered,
as also the Column, and other Relicks now
in Esteem, were found in places far distant
from one another; and if any Body ask
how they could come thither, they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
have recourse to Miracles, by which
they confirm the Matter. <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> a
Modern Writer, testifies the same Thing, as
having with extraordinary Care, search'd
into all the Writings of the Antient <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
and for that end unlock'd all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets
and Records of Monasteries, and that
by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi>'s Command, which no Man
did ever neglect with Impunity. This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
then speaking of the History of the
<hi>Britains,</hi> affirms, that the whole is full of
Obscurity, and that he had no leader whom
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52199:44"/>
he could follow. But <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
and our <hi>Holinshed</hi> reckon up Fathers and
Grand-fathers, and not only deduce the
whole Series from the Egg with the double
Yolk, the celebrated <hi>Trojan</hi> War, but from
a much older Period, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog,</hi> and old Father <hi>Dis,</hi> lest they should
come short of the <hi>Gauls;</hi> and in fine bring
it down from the Time of the <hi>Gigantick</hi>
Duels which they would fix as the Poll-Star
of the British History. So much concerning
<hi>Gildas.</hi> We shall touch on <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
afterwards, when we come to his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur.</hi>
After <hi>Gildas</hi> comes <hi>Bede,</hi> who brings
down his History as far as 734, almost to
the Reign of <hi>Ceol Wulphus</hi> King of the West
<hi>Saxons:</hi> His Credit I shall every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
entire, to let it be seen that I deal
fairly with <hi>Holinshed;</hi> From his Death, or
rather from the End of his History, which
falls about 734, to the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> I, who
began his Reign in 1110, I maintain that
the English have no certain History nor
Writer, except the Fragment of <hi>Ethelverd</hi>
who flourished about 1090, be reckon'd
an History; for I don't acknowledg the
Fragment of <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> who preceded <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelverd</hi>
twenty Years, as an History; and
<hi>Asserius Menevensis</hi> wrote only concerning
the Transactions of his own King <hi>Alfred.</hi>
But lest I should seem to have affirm'd any
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52199:45"/>
thing rashly, I shall bring English Historians
to witness this Matter. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>

Time, which was in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

about 1142, were utterly lost; nor was there
any who followed that study, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to pursue the Thread of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and one slothful Man being always
succeeded by another more slothful, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of Learning was for a long Time abated
in this Island, so that he had no other way
to inform himself concerning the Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those Times, but by the discourses
of antient Men. And the Author of the
Prologue to <hi>Malmsbury</hi>'s first Book, does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously
confess, that the History of 225
Years after <hi>Bede</hi>'s Death is intirely wanting:
so that even by his Evidence, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of certainty to be found in the British
History from 734, which was the Year of
<hi>Bede</hi>'s Death, to the Year 957, but all
things were founded upon the Rumours of
antient Men, and it may be old Wives Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which being collected together into
one Book, and put in a Latin Dress, made
up as it were the shadow of a History, from
whence <hi>Holinshed</hi> does nevertheless bring
most certain Arguments to establish his ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Homage. <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> agrees
in most things with <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> for they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52199:45"/>
were Contemporary. He says, That after
<hi>Bede's</hi> Death the English History ceas'd, but
that for his own part he had left things to
Posterity, either as he found them in the
Text of the English Chronicles, or as he
had them from the Relations of Men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Credit, or heard and saw them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
As to what concerns the Text of the
English Chronicles, he mentions them that
he may deceive his Reader with the greater
Facility; for if there was any Chronicle of
those Times, seeing <hi>Florence</hi> liv'd about the
Year 1148, they must still remain in the
Archives, which hitherto no English Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
did ever alledg, or hath been able to
demonstrate; for that Chronicle, as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by the Prologue, did only set down
the Number of Years: And as to those
things which he wrote either from the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Persons worthy of Credit, or what
he heard himself as certain Truths, neither
those things which are related by credible
Persons, nor such as one may think of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Verity, are sufficient to biass any
Man to the Prejudice or Injury of those
against whom they are related, except he
produce his Authors, that so there may be
room for our Objections against them, as is
usual against the most legal Witnesses; and
that we have enough of rational Grounds
for Objections, no Man of Candor who
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52199:46"/>
reads these things can so much as doubt.
The Scope of the whole is this, that it may
be manifest to all Men, that there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
nor Authentick English History, and that
there is no Authority nor certain Proof to
be had from thence, as to matters of Moment,
before <hi>Henry</hi> the second's Time, when Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
began to commit publick Transactions
to Writing, except what is to be found in
<hi>Gildas, Bede,</hi> and <hi>Ethelverd</hi> above mentioned.
But to come to the matter in Hand, if the
English can produce me one approved
Writer, even of their own Countrymen, who
compos'd a History from the Time of <hi>Bede</hi>
to that of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, I shall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give Ground, and yield this Proposition.
They who would be further inform'd, as to
the uncertainty of the English History, may
read the Prologue to <hi>Malmsbury</hi>'s first Book,
concerning the Lives of the English Bishops,
with the Prologue to <hi>Walsingham</hi>'s History,
and they will be obliged to confess, that I
have neither asserted any thing of my own,
nor relied upon the Authority of any Scots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
and therefore if there is nothing of
this fictitious Homage to be found in <hi>Caesar</hi>
or <hi>Tacitus,</hi> nor in <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> who came
after them, and that the rest of the History
is wanting, and that there is no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
but <hi>Bede,</hi> who writes of the English
Saxons and their Affairs, it must necessarily
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52199:46"/>
follow, that whatever things were writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Homage before the Conquest,
may safely be denied without hazarding our
Eternal Salvation; for we must not be rash
in believing Authors, who neither saw what
they write themselves, nor can bring any
approved Historians to vouch what they
say; as for Example, <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> do both
write of things before our Saviour's Birth:
but if they neither produce Witness, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
nor Surety for their Fidelity, I don't
see why we ought to believe them: Nor is
the bare Credit of an Historian sufficient for
those things which were before his own
Time, if he did not read them in other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
but had them only from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of credible Persons; for in that Case
the Reader must judg what is to be believ'd,
and what not.</p>
               <p>It's a general and grievous Complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the English, that hitherto they have
no Historian of Worth, of which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
this to be the Cause, that there is no
Reward propos'd, answerable to the Toil
and Fatigue<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to</hi> Thomas Walsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note>: But in my Opinion they
are much mistaken, and assign that as the
Cause, which is none at all; for there is no
Place where Vertue and Learning is more
bountifully rewarded than in <hi>England,</hi> and
consequently no Nation which abounds
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52199:47"/>
more with Learned Men. But they have
such Historians as they covet and desire, <hi>viz.</hi>
such as pursue Fables instead of Truth; for
they cannot endure to have their Histories
purg'd of such: Hence it comes to pass, that
no Learned Man attempts it, because he sees
that he must either offend the People, or
lose his Preferment and Dignity, if he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any of <hi>Geffrey</hi>'s Fables, but those are
not the Laws of History: For he who is
engag'd in such a Work, ought to observe
two things; first, That he write nothing
that is false, and next that he omit no part
of the Truth. <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> endeavoured
to rid his History of those Milesian Tales,
and old Wives Fables, but he durst not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
detract from them, though he does
manifestly distinguish his History from that
new one of the Babler <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth;</hi>
yet we see he is in no Esteem amongst the
English, though he be their only Historian,
who has writ with any Judgment: yet in
many places he deals unfairly with us, which
he does tacitly acknowledg himself, when he
says, that he only repeats what others have
writ, but abstains prudently from making
any Judgment of his own.</p>

               <head type="sub">That all the Witnesses brought for the Proof of
this Homage are suspected.</head>
               <p>THE fourth Proposition is concerning
the Nature of the Evidence, which
<hi>Holinshed</hi> makes use of in his virulent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective,
and of those which are also brought
by other English Historians. That sort of
Evidence is chargeable with three Faults;
First, That it is Monkish; Secondly, That
it is Domestick; And in the third Place,
that it is the Testimony of one Enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
another, as the Times then were. As
for the Testimony of Monks it is justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected;
for Monks being as it were dead to
the World, and consecrated to Christ alone,
they have no legal Right of giving Evidence:
for the business of Monks is not to teach,
but to mourn, and they are commanded to
abstain from all secular Affairs; neither can
they exercise the Office of a Clergyman or
Scrivener, confirm the publick Faith, or
draw up any publick Act to which Credit
may be given; but on the contrary, the
Title in the Canon Law does expresly enjoin
them not to concern themselves with secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Affairs: They cannot be Judges in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52199:48"/>
Concerns, nor so much as Witnesses
seeing they are accounted as dead, and the
Voice of Monks is reckoned ghastly. And
therefore I say, that if they ought to lead
a mournful and folitary Life in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,
and to abstain altogether from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Affairs, certainly it's very seldom, if
ever, that we ought to trust them in publick
Affairs, seeing they are not competent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
concerning them. For it is not very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that either the Secrets of Princes, or
things belonging to the State, were ever
communicated or imparted to them any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
than by common Report, seeing
they keep at the greatest distance imaginable
from all manner of Action, and do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
embrace things doubtful as certain,
and Fictions for matter of Fact: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this feigned Homage must of necessity
fall to the Ground, for which there's no
better Evidence than that of a Monk; for
it will not be admitted as a good Conclusion,
that because a Monk says so, therefore it is
true. This is certainly the common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all the Learned, that Monks are not
to be received as Evidence, especially in
great Matters, and such as have no relation
to the Monastical State and way of Living,
which they themselves did not see, but only
had them by the Relations of such as they
thought credible Persons. It may be they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52199:48"/>
took notice of Victories and the times of
War, but they were altogether uncertain as
to the Conditions of Peace, Circumstances
and Causes of Things, Agreements betwixt
Princes, and what was done in Publick and
Private amongst Foreign Nations.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Holinshed</hi> will object, that this is not
the Testimony of one Monk, but of all of
them that ever conveyed to us the History
of things past. I answer, that this I can
deny if an equal Interpretation be allowed
me, but however I will grant it; Yet this
must be confessed, that almost all of those who
wrote the English History till within this
hundred Years were Monks, and followed
whatever they found in former Histories or
Manuscripts, lest they should derogate from
the Honour of their Country; so that they
made it a matter of Religion to vary, in
the least from them. As for Example, let
<hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> be supposed the first
who wrote of this Homage and Fealty; for
I believe he is the very first whom our
Neighbours can produce: <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
and <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntington,</hi> who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Contemporaries, followed him, as did
also <hi>Roger Hoveden, Matthew</hi> of <hi>Paris, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Walsingham</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi>
the first leading his followers into an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
as we see among Cattel, that if one
break over the Ditch the rest follow; and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52199:49"/>
conceive that they may lawfully do so when
they have the Credit of their Predecessors
to support them. To this may be added,
that they discourse of things which not only
happened before they were born them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but at a much greater distance of
Time, when mean while they have nothing
to make good their Point. For what is it
which others then, and they now, may not
forge concerning things which were done
many Ages before; if, as we say in Court,
they produce no other cause of Knowledg
but Hearsay and deceitful Fame, which
grows as it runs, and of a Flie becomes an
Elephant? Moreover, in those Writings of
the Monks, there appears a mighty Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of our Affairs: and seeing they don't
so much as know the Names of our Kings,
they can far less be acquainted with their
Actions. In the Catalogue of the Kings
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there's neither <hi>Iresius</hi> nor
<hi>Rinaldus</hi> to be found: but those Monks
write that both of them perform'd Homage
to the King of <hi>England.</hi> That there were
then any Kings of <hi>Cumberland, Gallowdy,
Man,</hi> and the Western Islands, was not so
much as heard of; yet these good Monks,
that they might advance the Glory of their
own Nation, were not afraid to leave it to
Posterity, that all those Kings or Roytolets,
together with <hi>Edgar</hi> the petty King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52199:49"/>

                  </gap> for my own part, I don't think that
they understood the name of a <hi>Liege-Fee,</hi> or
what was meant by the <hi>Homage</hi> which they
talk of, seeing that is understood by few but
those who have some knowledg of the Law,
or Judicial Proceedings. Nor were the Monks
free from Perturbations of Mind, and their
Passions of Love toward their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and Hatred against their Enemies; and
being shut up in Cloysters; they are so much
the more obnoxious to their Passions and
Aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctions, from which Historians ought to
be freer than others. Nor was there any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Men who did more hunt after Court-Applause
by Flattery and Assentation, than
they; as knowing that it was a sure Way of
obtaining the Favour of their Princes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must this be past over, that it is no new
thing among English Historians to have
Fictions for Matters of Fact, supposititious
Stories instead of Realities; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
true Histories corrupted either by
adding or diminishing, as they thought it
conducible to the Honour of their Nation.
<hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> is a famous Witness of the
former, as to the Counterfeit History of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52199:50"/>
                  <hi>Gildas</hi> and others, and the Author of the
Prologue to <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for the latter, in those Words; <q>You
must not wonder, says he, though you
perceive most Authors to be so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
as to have their Writings adulterated
by the Fraud of Posterity, seeing some
Men are come to that height of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that by adding and diminishing,
they make any Author, how pious so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to patronize the most execrable Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies,
according as they have a mind to it.</q>
How easy then was it to insert in those Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
Writings, when they take notice that
the K. of <hi>Scots</hi> did sometimes pay Homage to
the K. of <hi>England,</hi> as the latter did to the
K. of <hi>France;</hi> that the said Homage was paid
for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as we shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
explain more at large? Nay, the
Truth of the Monastick Writings is in many
places questioned by <hi>Holinshed</hi> himself in his
History. We must also consider the Time
when those Historians wrote, which was in
the Heat of the War, when the Nations
were eagerly fighting about this very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
About whose Time liv'd <hi>Florence</hi>
of <hi>Worcester, Malmsbury, Huntington</hi> and
<hi>Hovedon;</hi> and <hi>Thomas Walsingham,</hi> and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
of <hi>Westminster,</hi> wrote in the very Heat
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52199:50"/>
of that bloody War betwixt <hi>Edward</hi> I, II,
and III. and our Kings about this Homage.
In which Quarrel, there fell 300000 Men:
And who was it that did not at that Time
endeavour to maintain the Cause of his

appear unto all Men; and patroniz'd it not

What strange things did the Monks feign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Henry</hi> II. on account of their St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was in my Opinion
the most villanous of Men? And that they
might advance the Reputation of him, and
his Ecclesiastical Order, they speak diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
both of the Cause and Power of their
own Kings. These things prevail with me, as
perhaps they may do with the Learned World,
not to be over-credulous in believing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Monks assert; but that their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
which are suspicious enough of
themselves, ought to be exactly weigh'd with
the Credit of History, and the Probability
of the Matters of Fact; as I shall take care to
compare them together when they occur,
that the impartial Reader may according to
his own Candor, judg what is most like to be
true. For it is in every Body's Mouth,

               <p>We have more to say why we suspect the
Evidence of the Monks, when we come to
their particular Testimonies.</p>
               <p>We object against their Probation in the
second place, that it's domestick; and how
little Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> is to be given to that sort of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
the Customs of every Nations, the
Law it self, and daily Experience, does suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
demonstrate. This one thing I affirm,
that there's no Nation in <hi>Europe</hi> which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of domestick Evidence where either the
Wealth or Dignity of the Lord is concerned;
it being certain that such kind of Witnesses
are every where rejected, except the Matter
be done within the Walls of his own House,
and so as it cannot be prov'd otherwise, or
that they are produc'd against the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
and therefore though the Testimony of
those Monks might perhaps be taken against
their own Prior or Fellow-Monks, as to
things done within the Walls of their own
Monastry; yet they are not to be admitted
as to the Secrets of State, Peace, War, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52199:51"/>
of Courts, or Conditions of Peace, and
things of greatest moment. What the Civil
Law says concerning domestick Evidence, or
the Authority thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> appears plainly by the
R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>script of <hi>Valerian</hi> and <hi>Galien;</hi> Whose
Words are these, <hi>The Credit of Domestick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
is also rejected by the Civil Law.</hi> And
in saying so, those Emperors seem to follow
that Answer of <hi>Paul,</hi> the Tenor whereof is
this: <hi>Those Witnesses which the Plaintiff brought
from home, I would not so much as examine.</hi>
But the Emperors <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximiam</hi>
are yet more plain: <hi>We ought to make use of
those Witnesses,</hi> say they, <hi>for maintaining the
Truth, who chuse to give Evidence for Truth
without either Fear or Favour.</hi> And therefore
those who give Evidence ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
neither on the Power nor Favour of
those for whom they give it: For who will
affirm, that the Monks had not the Favour of
their Princes in view, or were afraid of their
Power, when they writ those things? Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
say, that such Men are not reckoned
proper Evidence, who can be commanded to
be Witnesses; and therefore Subjects in the
Cause of their King and Country, an enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis'd
Servant in the Cause of his Patron,
and a Servant in the Cause of his Master, are
not to be admitted as Evidence. The Reason
given by the Doctors is, because they swear
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52199:52"/>
whatever they are commanded, and suppress
the Truth for fear of their Masters. But in
our Controversy there are none who give
Evidence against us but English-men, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the K. of <hi>England</hi>'s Power; whom he
could compel to give their Testimony, and
dictate how they should depone: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
they are such as give Evidence for their
Country and its Dignity, and are consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Witnesses in their own Cause; for that
such things as are writ for the Safety and
Honour of a Nation, pertain to every one
of the Country, no wise Man will deny.
And so I absolve this Proposition, having
confirm'd it by the Custom of all Nations,
the Precepts of all Laws, and Reason it self.
And therefore the Domestick Testimony of
the English for the Proof of this <hi>feigned Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi>
is not sufficient to prejudg a third
Person, but ought to be exploded when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it occurs, as being justly suspected in
all its parts. All the Doctors of the Law
maintain, that a Domestick Testimony ought
to be rejected. But I shall demonstrate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
that we have no great reason to
be afraid of the Testimony of those Monks;
but on the contrary, that they will make
very much for our Cause, if we be but allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to put a favourable Interpretation upon
their words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:52199:52"/>The third Fault is yet far more grievous;
for we are not only press'd with the Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
Testimony of the English, but because
the Evidence of an Enemy against an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as Times then were, is received as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,
and believed more firmly than the
Oracles of <hi>Sibylla</hi> or <hi>Delphos.</hi> Law, and
daily Practice, do both admonish that Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and Enmity ought to be far from a
Witness; for there's none of the Affections
more violent, or which do sooner incline
to Wickedness, than Hatred, when it seizes
upon the Mind of an impotent Man; and
therefore capital Enmity does exclude a
Witness from giving his Evidence in Law.
And moreover; We not only forbid the
Testimony of one Enemy to be received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
another in Law, but do the like if they
be but newly reconcil'd; and refuse also the

But when those things were writby the
English, there were not only Capital Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the Case, (I call them Capital, when
two Nations fight with incensed Minds to
decide which shall be Sovereign, and have
the Command of the other) but Mortal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and a Hatred exceeding that of <hi>Thye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,</hi>
when the one Nation conspired to the
Destruction of the other, and bent their
whole Strength, Actions and Purposes, to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52199:53"/>
that End; that the Enemies being utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated
and rooted out, the Survivors
might enjoy their Place; and how often the
English have attempted that against us, will
appear from what follows: Then whether or
not any Testimony can be admitted from
those who not only raged against us by
Word and Writ, but committed the most
atrocious Cruelties upon us by Violence
and Arms, without standing upon what was
lawful or unlawful, let those judg who
are any way conversant in Affairs: For my
own part, I am not afraid of the Censure of
any Man who is able to make a just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>There are three things by which all Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Matters are governed amongst us, <hi>viz,
Law, Custom,</hi> and <hi>Reason;</hi> and certainly nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Laws nor Customs of Nations, nor
Reason it self, will allow such sort of Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:
For the Law restrains Capital Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
from giving Evidence against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Neither is there any more Credit to be
given to an English-man against a Scots-man,
than to a Scots-man against an English-man,
or to a French-man against an English-man,
than to an English-man against a French-man:
For what is there which the English

               <head type="sub">This Homage is not consistent with the Feudal
Law.</head>
               <p>OUR fifth Proposition to prove the
Negative as to this Homage, is
taken from the Nature of a Feu or Fee;
for by the Feudal Law, it is not possible
that <hi>Scotland</hi> can be a Feu of <hi>England,</hi> or
that ever the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> could be
a Vassal thereof, or the King of <hi>England</hi>
his Superior: For a Fee comes from the
Lord, and is wholly owing to his Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Bounty, who settles some part of
his Patrimony upon his <hi>Vassal</hi> or <hi>Faithful
Servant,</hi> (for so are Vassals called in the
Feudal Law) that he may be Faithful, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the same Interest, have the same Friends
and Enemies with his Lord, and serve him
honestly in War, as becomes a Souldier.
Therefore a Fee is the most strict and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
Bond of Humane Society, by which
the Lord is obliged for ever to the Vassal,
as well as the Vassal to the Lord, that the
one shall defend the other's Life, good Name
and Estate, to the utmost of his Power,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52199:55"/>
against all Men, by whatever Kindred, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,
or Obligation conjoin'd, (Parents
only excepted) yea, even against their own
Children, which they are either to put out
of their Family, or reconcile them to their
Lord. And the like is to be perform'd by
the Lord, in respect of his Vassal, if injur'd
by any of his Lord's Children; for either
the Lord must reconcile them to his Vassal,
or exclude them from himself and his Family.
If e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d
to assist him with his Forces, Arms,
Horses and in a Word, to the utmost of
his Power, even though he be not call'd;
he is also to withstand his Enemies, never
to enter into a League with them, and the
one is to have the same Friends and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
with the other. If any Difference hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
betwixt the Lord and Vassal, it is not
to be decided by Arms, but referr'd to
Judgment; yet the Feudal Law will more
readily allow Arms to the Vassal, if his Lord
deny him Justice, seeing the Fault is rather
presum'd to be in the Lord. Neither has
the Vassal any other way to force his Lord
to make Compensation for his Damage.
So the Vassal must not discover his Lord's
Secrets; he is obliged to defend the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
committed to his Care in his Lord's
Name, and for his Use; to hazard his own
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52199:55"/>

he is deprived of his Fee. The Vassal is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged

his Counsel, and the like out of Court, as
often as he shall be call'd upon, when his

                  </gap>ee without it; and in fine, he is
obliged to maintain a sincere and inviolable
Fidelity towards his Lord; and when he
swears the same, he performs Homage.</p>
               <p>The Lord, though he be no less obliged
to be faithful to his Vassal, than the Vassal
is to him, yet he is not bound to swear, this
Respect being due to the Lord, that he is to
be believed without giving his Oath: but
in other things, this Trust is managed with
equal Faith and Benevolence on both Sides;
so that the Lord is no less bound to the Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
in all the things above-mentioned, than
the Vassal is to the Lord, and the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is reciprocal. But if any of those things
be found, as to the Case of <hi>Scotland;</hi> If the
like Offices were performed, either by the
English to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> or by the <hi>Scots</hi>
to the King of <hi>England;</hi> if the Kingdom
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52199:56"/>
of <hi>Scotland</hi> was ever part of the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or under the Protection of that which
is now called the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it were a long Time before the English
Monarchy had a Being, as Englishmen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
confess, so that the King of <hi>Scots</hi>
could neither hold his Kingdom as part of
the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Patrimony, nor by
his Bounty: If there were not always more
than Capital Enmities betwixt the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and if there were not the most cruel
Actions that could be, War, Slaughters, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastations,
Burnings, bloody Battels, and
more than <hi>Vatinian</hi> Hatred betwixt the two
Kingdoms: If the King of <hi>England</hi> did not
always stir up Enemies against the <hi>Scots,</hi>
as we shall make it evident afterwards,
when we come to speak of the <hi>Picts,</hi> and
<hi>Edward Baliol;</hi> and on the other Hand, if
the King of <hi>Scots</hi> did not assist the King of
<hi>France</hi> with all his Might against the King
of <hi>England,</hi> both by sending Auxiliaries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France,</hi> infesting them at Home, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
them to fight, and always preferred
the French King's Interest to the King of
<hi>England</hi>'s, even in the greatest of his own
Difficulties and Dangers, (which was neither
the part of a Vassal to his Lord, nor of a
Lord to his Vassal:) If ever the King of
<hi>Scots</hi> appear'd at the King of <hi>England</hi>'s
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52199:56"/>
Court or Parliament, either to give Advice,
or receive Judgment: If ever any King of
<hi>Scots</hi> was invested by the King of <hi>England,</hi>
or desired the Renovation of the Investiture;
or if the Consent of the King of <hi>England</hi>
was ever expected, or desired at the Inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration
of our Kings: we shall not deny,
but that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> owes the
Fealty of a <hi>Client</hi> and <hi>Homage</hi> to the King
of <hi>England,</hi> and that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> shall
be accounted his Liege Vassal and Client,
and bound to all Services as such. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there were always those Grudges and
Hatreds betwixt the Nations that we read
of, and that almost without any intermission,
for above 1000 Years; What Man who is
capable of making an equal Judgment, will
give it as his Opinion, that the King of
<hi>Scots</hi> owes the Fealty of a Client to the King

               <p>Now I come to the Confutation of the
particular Proofs, brought by <hi>Holinshed,</hi> or
as he says, by <hi>Nicholas Adams,</hi> a Pettifogger,
who, in my Opinion, has but very little
Skill in the Law; and seeing all those Proof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which are brought against us, consist in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52199:57"/>
which rather demonstrate what was
done, than what ought to be done, I shall
divide them into three Classes or Ranks:
The first shall be of those which are belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to have been done in the Time of the
Kings of the <hi>Britains,</hi> or <hi>Brittons;</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of those, which hapned in the Time of
the English Saxons; and the third of those,
which <hi>Holinshed,</hi> who is very prodigal of
his Faith and Credit, writes to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
since the Conquest. Yet so as we
must always take the five general Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
before mentioned along with us, that
we may not seem to recede from them in
the least; but I shall endeavour to wipe off
those things which he hath, by the height
of Fraud and Calumny, writ against us,
and endeavoured to fix on us by his vain
and petulant Pen, after having examin'd the
Particulars duly and exactly.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>HOlinshed</hi>'s first Argument is deduc'd
from that Commentitious Division of
<hi>Britain</hi> amongst <hi>Brutus</hi> his three Sons,
<hi>Locrinus</hi> the eldest, <hi>Camber</hi> the second, and
<hi>Albanactus</hi> the youngest: for the English
do stiffly assert, that to <hi>Locrinus</hi> he gave
<hi>Loegria</hi> or <hi>Britain,</hi> viz. that part of it
which was a Roman Province, or possess'd
by the Angles, with the Superiority of the
whole Island; to <hi>Camber, Cambria</hi> or <hi>Wales;</hi>
and to <hi>Albanactus</hi> as the youngest, the least
valuable share, <hi>viz. Albania,</hi> that is, the
whole Country benorth <hi>Humber.</hi> And all
this we shall grant, that we may not be
troublesome, and so we shall suppose that
to have been, which never was, although
there cannot be any thing said or imagined,
that is more vain than this <hi>Brutus</hi> and his
Fable, as <hi>Buchanan</hi> bath evinc'd. But <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banactus</hi>
being kill'd, which happened very
speedily after, as they say, <hi>Albania,</hi> which
was his Portion, accrued to <hi>Locrinus,</hi> and not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52199:58"/>
to <hi>Camber,</hi> by the Right of Primogeniture;
and this we shall not deny, though it helps
but very little to prove the Conclusion
which <hi>Holinshed</hi> undertook. But this Right
of Primogeniture is still observed amongst
the <hi>Scots,</hi> says he, so that when the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of three Brethren dies, the eldest suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
as Heir of his whole Estate, and the
Second is past by. And therefore seeing
the Scots observed the same Laws and
Customs with the <hi>Britains,</hi> it necessarily
follows, that they were their Subjects; and
this is the Form of his first Argument. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's
Nestor</hi> is commended by all Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that in marshalling his Army, he posted
his stoutest Souldiers in the Front and Reer,
and plac'd the most faint-hearted in the
Middle, that they might be compell'd to
fight, by the Magnanimity of the former,
and the Valour of the latter. I thought
that <hi>Holinshed</hi> would have taken the same
Method, and plac'd his strongest Reasons
in the Front, which it would not have been
easy for our Country-men to rencounter.
But let's see what this first Argument is: It
is true, that in <hi>England,</hi> when the Youngest
of three Brethren dies, the Eldest succeeds
to his Estate by right of Promogeniture,
and the Second is passed by: but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more false than to say, that the same
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52199:59"/>
Custom is observed amongst the <hi>Scots;</hi> for
if the Question about <hi>Albanactus</hi> his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
had been decided according to our
Customs, or in our Courts, <hi>Camber</hi> would
have succeeded to his whole Estate, and not
the least Share of it would have come to
<hi>Locrinus:</hi> Then what are we to expect from
this Man in the Conclusion, when he does
so manifestly stumble at the Threshold?
And what if we should grant him this, that
<hi>Locrinus</hi> should have succeeded to <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nactus,</hi>
that is, to the Government of all
<hi>Britain</hi> according to our Law? How will
he thence prove, that the <hi>Scots</hi> are subject
to the English? Will it necessarily follow,
that because they observe the same Laws,
Rites and Customs, that they are their
Subjects? It had been better argued accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Laws of Disputation, that they
were the same People, or that the one drew
their Original from the other; and yet if
he had done so, it had not been according
to the Rules of Logick neither; for those
who worship the same God, and observe the
same Laws, Customs and sacred Rites, are
not always to be look'd on as the same People,
and much less that one of them must needs
therefore be subject to another. For the
second Table of the Mosaick Law, the Law
of Nations, the Civil Law, this our Feudal

the Grecian Laws, afterwards known

Homage to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or acknowledg'd

it, or that there are any Hopes of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

from it, that the Customs observ'd in
one Nation, are transferr'd to another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be distinct in Empire and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction:
and thus many of the Laws of
the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Brittons,</hi> are still in force

English at present are govern'd by no other

is subject to another, because of their
agreement in Laws, or rather in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Law, is altogether void of Reason;
and by that same Argument, he may as well
prove the English to be subject to the Scots,
as the Scots to the English: for a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Laws, and much less an agreement
in one Law, does not subject one Nation to
another, nor indeed unite them. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by as many Laws and Customs as we
disagree fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m the English, we are as many
ways disjoin'd; for no Body is ignorant, that
in some things our Law differs from that
of <hi>England:</hi> and therefore <hi>Adams</hi> or <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshed</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:52199:60"/>
infers very weakly, that one Nation
is subject to another, because of the Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
or Communion of one Law or Custom.
Moreover, <hi>Holinshed</hi> and others make <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nactus</hi>
the Youngest of <hi>Locrinus</hi> his Sons;
whereas <hi>Edward</hi> the First, in his Letter to
Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. calls him his Second;
so that to reconcile those when neither of
them is to be credited, were the part of a
Man who has a Mind to mispend his spare
Time. This is also of the same Nature that
<hi>Holinshed</hi> derives the Prerogative of this
Primogeniture from <hi>Brutus,</hi> but <hi>Edward</hi> I.
from the Customs of the <hi>Trojans,</hi> whom if
<hi>Holinshed</hi> had followed, he had consulted the
Common Tranquillity much better, seeing
by the common Institutions of both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
be might have argued, that they had
One and the same Original, and were the
same People.</p>
               <p>The only thing I wonder at is, how this
<hi>Superiority</hi> came to be continued to these
Times: for if <hi>Locrinus</hi> had the Superiority
of <hi>Albany,</hi> and succeeded to <hi>Albanactus</hi>
deceased, it necessarily follows, that the
Liege Fee was extinguish'd with <hi>Albanactus,</hi>
and that <hi>Albany</hi> return'd to the Superior
Lord, <hi>per consolidationem utilis Dominii cum
directo,</hi> as is usual in <hi>Vassalages,</hi> where the
Lord of the dominant Estate succeeds to the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52199:61"/>
Lord of the Subordinate, or as the Creditor
succeeds to the Debtor, and <hi>per contra;</hi> and
so this Superiority evanish'd in its Infancy,
being stifled with <hi>Albanactus,</hi> who did not
long out-live his Father: Nor was it ever
for any thing that I know, reviv'd again.
And if we would examine this Fable of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
in every particular, which is the very
Foundation of this Plea, it would vanish into
Smoak; and so all this Proof, with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it, must be buried in darkness. He
who would be further inform'd as to this
Fable, may read our <hi>Buc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>anan,</hi> who exposes
it as a Subject of Laughter to all Mankind.
Perhaps I have been more prolix than was
needful in refuting this Argument; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
those kind of Arguments are so often
repeated by <hi>Holinshed,</hi> I resolved to answer
them to the full if there were more of them.</p>
               <p>His second Argument is brought from
<hi>Ebrancus,</hi> who was King of the Brittons, as
he dreams, and fortified the Castles of <hi>Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barton</hi>
and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the two strongest in
<hi>Scotland.</hi> Therefore, argues he, those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
were then under the Command of the
Brittons; and to use <hi>Holinshed</hi>'s Words,
<q>
                     <hi>Ebrancus</hi> was then seized of them, so that
the Scots held them by the Bounty of the
King of the Brittons.</q> We will grant that
those Castles were built by <hi>Ebrancus,</hi> though
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52199:61"/>
they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Slaughter of <hi>Hengist.</hi> But if we
insist on the Confutation of all the Follies of
<hi>Holinshed,</hi> and this petty Lawyer, it would
require a Twelve-month to peruse it. If
any Body argue, that the King of Scots, who
is now possessed of those Castles, owes Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to the King of the Brittons because he
built them; by that same way of Arguing,
the English Saxons owe Homage to the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons;
and the Normans, who are now in
possession, owe Homage to the English Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
because the English did by force of
Arms seize the Lands, Towns, Castles, and
in fine the Countries of the Brittons, as the
Normans threw the English out of their Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions;
and yet the English Saxon never
acknowledged the King of the Brittons, nor
did the Norman ever acknowledg the King
of the English as his Superiour or Liege-Lord:
Or, because the Israelites built Towns
and Castles for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> did he serve them
and owe them Homage, or were the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
then seiz'd of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But in those Cases
he who is strongest by Arms, has the best
Title in Law, though neither that nor the
other Argument touch the Scots, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52199:62"/>
none of them at that Time in <hi>Britain.</hi>
Nor is there any mention of the Word (<hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinaru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>)
Seizings,</hi> for almost 2000 Years after
in any Writer; and therefore that Objection
is rejected as trifling, and unworthy of an
Answer.</p>
               <p>The third Argument speaks of <hi>Clotenius;</hi>
who is affirmed to be mentioned by the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of both Kingdoms, as having reign'd
over all <hi>Britain;</hi> and what is meant by that,
we shall see by and by. But no Scots-man did
ever mention this <hi>Clotenius:</hi> Nay, <hi>Holinshed</hi>
himself does not say that he reign'd over all
<hi>Britain,</hi> but only over the Mountainous
Country of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> from whence he had a
very long Way to go and command in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
either by Land or Sea. Nay, in this
<hi>Clotenius Holinshed</hi> does not obscurely call the
whole Fable of <hi>Brutus</hi> in question, and says
that his Off-spring fail'd in <hi>Clotenius,</hi> but that
too much Self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>love drew him aside, that he
might have occasion of insulting over us
more freely. But if <hi>Clotenius</hi> did reign over
all <hi>Britain,</hi> as our Author will have it, then
there was no Part of it which held of him
in <hi>Service</hi> or <hi>Fee,</hi> whether he consider the
Parts as Homogeneous or Heterogeneous:
for as Lawyers speak, A Man's own Estate
cannot hold of him in <hi>Fee</hi> or <hi>Service;</hi> for
<hi>Service</hi> or <hi>Vassalage</hi> is required from another's,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52199:62"/>
and not his own. But what does this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Scots, who were not then in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?</hi>
Or what relation has it to the <hi>Homage</hi>
of the Scots, which he undertook to prove?
So that this Instance of <hi>Clotenius</hi> is so foreign
to the Purpose, that it neither maintains <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshed</hi>'s
Opinion, nor refutes ours; for tho'
we should grant all that he says concerning it
to be true, it will not be of the least Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to his Conclusion.</p>
               <p>But the Scots, says <hi>Holinshed,</hi> received the
Law concerning Duels from <hi>Mulmutius
Dunwallo</hi> the King of the Brittons, who was
the first that made it, and they do still retain
it: Therefore, says he, the Scots were then
his Subjects, because they received that same
Law. That the Law concerning Duels was
first instituted by <hi>Mulmutius,</hi> none of the
Antients did ever affirm; nor do I know
from whom he has it. If he hath it from
none of the Antients, what does he bring to
enforce our Belief? <hi>To play the fool on the
Credit of a Great Author, is almost the part of
a wise Man,</hi> says the Comical Poet; <hi>but to
rave without any Authority, is plainty the part
of a mad Man.</hi> This Argument also coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides,
and has altogether an Affinity with the
first: But to say, because the Scots embraced
the same Law, that therefore they were Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
is a perfect Paralogism, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52199:63"/>
He might with better Reason argue,
that we are now subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the English, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we make use of the same Language, the
same Translation of the Bible, and delight in
the Bow as they do; and therefore I shall not
insist upon the Confutation of him, having
said more than enough to this Way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing:
For if all Nations, as this Man infers,
who embraced the Custom of Duels, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King of the Britains, or did him Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
then <hi>Palestine</hi> must have belong'd to
the Britains; in which <hi>Goliah</hi> and <hi>David</hi>
fought a Duel long before <hi>Dunwallo</hi>'s Time.
And in like manner, <hi>Asia Minor,</hi> and the

with <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> with <hi>Ajax</hi> and

the Britains, because of the Duel betwixt

of that Name: And hence it will follow,
that <hi>Greece</hi> was under the British Empire,

<hi>Germany,</hi> in which there are still many Laws
concerning Duels; and especially in the
Laws of the Lombards, amongst whom all
Probations were made by Duels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Britain</hi> would indeed have been mightily

brought all the Countries where Duels were
us'd under her Subjection; for there was
never any who extended the Confines of the
British Empire so far. But no wise Man
would have ascrib'd the first Institution of
Duels to the Britains, seeing it was common
to all the Northern Nations: For <hi>Saxo
Grammaticus</hi> writes that <hi>Frotho</hi> K. of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
made a Law that all Controversies
should be decided by the Sword. But I pass
over <hi>Holinshed</hi>'s Trifles, who ascribes the
Original of Primogeniture and Duelling to
his Brittons, tho they be both mentioned in
the Holy Scriptures long before <hi>Brutus</hi> his
Time. Now what I pray do these three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments

other English-man can produce an Author
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52199:66"/>
for this notorious Falshood, we will either
give him an Answer, or yield the Cause:
For the Babler <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> of
whom we shall speak anon, leaves him here
without defence; nor is there any mention
of those Kings to be found in him. Nay,
<hi>Holinshed</hi> in his whole History, is perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
silent as to this <hi>Sicil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>us</hi> his Victories over
the Scots, or their Surrender of themselves
unto him. But perhaps he thought that he
was obliged to use more Modesty in an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
than in a Declamation; where he
could blab out whatever came in his Head.
However, it's a Sign of a dishonest Mind ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to speak things that we don't know, or
to suppress those which we do, if either Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or Dishonour may thereby accrue to
another. Therefore whatever <hi>Holinshed</hi> has
in this Matter, he excerpted it from our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians;
but how little Candor he hath us'd
towards us, was never plainer than here.
Our Historians relate, that after the Return
of <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>therus</hi> from the Isles, Affairs not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thorowly settled, that the King of the
Brittons fatigu'd them with War as he had
always done: but this honest Author adds
of his own, until they made a Surrender of
themselves; which was not to be found in
any Historian of what note soever. The
Reigns of those six Kings before-mentioned
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52199:66"/>
makes up 118 Years; and therefore I would
desire <hi>Holinshed</hi> to resolve me this one Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
How this <hi>Sicilius</hi> could vex all those
six Kings with War, seeing he only reigned
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Years, as he himself confesses? But he
had laid aside all Shame in this his Invective.
It is not to be passed over, that he owns those
Kings to have been chosen by our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
Whence it's evident, that we had
Kings many Ages before the Arrival of the
English Saxons in <hi>Britain;</hi> and that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration
of our Kings did never depend
upon the Pleasure of the Brittons or Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish:
Nor was ever their Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent expected
at the Election; which is a certain Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that they were never subject to the
Brittons, as we shall see afterwards. Here
<hi>Holinshed</hi> pleases himself with a facetious
Rhetorical Flourish, when he writes that
<hi>Sicilius</hi> gave his Daughter <hi>Agasia</hi> to <hi>Durstus</hi>
King of <hi>Scots;</hi> hoping, says he, that the
connate Rudeness (not to say Deceit
and Perfidy) of the Nation might be
corrected and mollified by the Disposition
of the Maternal Line: But let Foreigners
be enquir'd at concerning the Rudeness, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and Perfidy of either Nation; for no
great heed is to be taken to what an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
says of a Scots-man, or what a Scots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
says of an English-man, seeing there
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52199:67"/>
have been Actions betwixt them much fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
than Words. The Faithfulness of the
Scots is proven by the French Annals. But
<hi>Holinshed</hi> ought to remember what the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
and English Writers have left upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
concerning the Faithfulness of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons;
for all of them agree, that it was us'd
as a Proverb,
<q>Nec Britones Bello fortes nec Pace fideles:</q>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> That the Brittons were neither couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in War, nor faithful in time of Peace.
This Proverb is found in <hi>Polydore, Bede,
Newbridg, Malmsbury,</hi> and other English
Historians; who all of 'em say, that it was
common amongst the Vulgar: and in many
places both in <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Bede,</hi> they are
called the perfidious Nation of the Brittons;
as if Perfidy were their proper Epithet. So
that a Depravation of their Native Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and Manners, was rather to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from this Match, than a Reformation. I
have already touch'd the Cowardly Temper
of that Nation from <hi>Gildas,</hi> and shall treat
of it further when I come to speak of the
Saxons. Then let <hi>Holinshed</hi> go and extol
the Faithfulness, Vertue, and Fortitude of
his Brittons to the Skies, or above them if
he pleases; and let him talk of their subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52199:67"/>
                  <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and a great Part of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
and that <hi>Rome</hi> it self was conquered
and burnt by <hi>Brennus,</hi> if you please to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him; while all the antient Writers do
not only dissent from him, but gain-stand
and contradict him. Those things I say of
the antient Brittons; for as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Remainders of that Nation, there's
no People, now that they have chang'd
their Soil, who are more couragious and
hardy than the Welch, since they were born
and bred in a barren and mountainous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

see to it; he's not to be found in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of our Kings. But to return to <hi>Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belanus;</hi>
Certainly we are but sorrily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
if we must be accounted to have
been subject to him, because we sent him
Auxiliary Forces: For on the other hand,
if the English had sent Auxiliaries to us,
they would have alledged that they had
done so as Masters; but there is nothing
here of <hi>Homage,</hi> or <hi>Liege-Dominion</hi> over us.
Must <hi>Germany</hi> be said to have been subject
to <hi>England,</hi> because the Emperor <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
serv'd in the English Camp for Pay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the French? Or, because the Queen
of <hi>England</hi> sent Assistance to the Spaniard at
the Siege of St. <hi>Quintin</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> must She
therefore be accounted to have been subject
to the Spaniard? No English-man would
endure <hi>Holinshed</hi> to reason thus; neither
does he act with Judgment or Justice, who
by a reproachful Interpretation would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Good-will of his Friend into a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Obedience, or an Obligation of
spontaneous Submission: for by that way of
Arguing, we shall conclude the Lord to be
inferiour to the Servant, if he assist him in
Adversity, or extend his Munificence and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52199:68"/>
Liberality towards him. We will grant that
our Forces serv'd in that War, but what
Consequence will that be to infer thence,
that <hi>Ederus</hi> was Servant or Subject to <hi>Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belanus</hi>
or paid him Homage? It was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that one should command the rest in
the War, and that they should obey and
serve him; for the word <hi>serve</hi> is us'd by
good Authors, to denote only Obedience;
and thus <hi>Iugurtha</hi> serv'd <hi>Africanus</hi> the
Younger in the <hi>Numatin</hi> War, in the Name
of the King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> yet the Kingdom
of <hi>Numidia</hi> was free and independant, and
their King not call'd a Servant, but an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociate
of the Romans. But this whole sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> that part of it excepted
which is found in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Commentaries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
nothing but Fables and Trifles, and
was either forg'd by <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
or illustrated by his Comments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holinshed</hi> says, that <hi>Caesar</hi> writes in his
own Commentaries, and that it is attested
by the Scotish Historians, that he subdued
the whole Island, and entred into <hi>Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi>
both of which are false, as will appear
to any who read those Histories: for <hi>Caesar</hi>
went no further than he himself writes, and
it is not likely that he would detract from
his own Fame; and that Edifice at <hi>Carron</hi>
was not built by <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> but by <hi>Iulius

Agricola</hi> some Years after him: Neither does

but asserts only, that it was reported so by

with the History in this Point, which I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
admire, nor regard; nor will he ever
be able to prove from this Commentitious
History of <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> that <hi>Scotland</hi> was a

there is no mention of any War which

in their Reigns, as well as others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But lest he should seem to have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
here, he savs, that King <hi>Lucius</hi> chang'd
the three Archflamins, which were insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by King <hi>Belinus</hi> into three Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
whereof he places one at <hi>London,</hi>
another at <hi>York,</hi> to whom he subjects the
Scots, and the third at <hi>Caerleon;</hi> and all
those things he alledges, that he may clear
the Way for rendring the Scots Bishops sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Archbishop of <hi>York:</hi> and as he
will have the Scots to be subject to the
English in Temporals; so he would infer,
that the Scotish Clergy acknowledged the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52199:69"/>
English Archbishops as their Lords in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals.
But if we may believe <hi>Malmsbury</hi>
an English Chronologer, there was no Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoprick
in the Kingdom of the <hi>Brittons.</hi>
His words, lest I should be thought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
him, are, <hi>But whether there was any
Archiepiscopal See in the Time of the</hi> Brittons,
<hi>I do very much doubt; for my Knowledg faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
because Antiquity hath swallow'd up the
Memorials of those Times:</hi> and here he spoke
ingenuously, if he had done so in other
things<note n="*" place="margin">In prol. Lib. I. de Geftis An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorum Pontisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note>.
Neither does <hi>Gildas</hi> make any
mention of the Bishops, or Archflamins of
the <hi>Brittons,</hi> but only of the Priests. As to
what concerns the Archflamins, there is no
mention of them to be found in approved
Authors, except we should reckon <hi>Geffrey</hi>
of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who is the greatest Liar of
all Men, one of that number, for which
they shall have my free leave. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Institutions of <hi>Numa,</hi> and the
Antient Romans, there could be no Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamins;
and if there had been any such,
they must of necessity have been set over
other Flamins, which is manifestly as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to Truth, as that the Scots Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
are subject to the Archbishop of <hi>York.</hi>
The severals Gods of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had their
own Flamins, and thus we read of <hi>Flamen
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52199:70"/>
Dialis</hi> and <hi>Flamen Quirinalis</hi> in <hi>Cicero,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 2. <hi>de</hi> Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note> over whom the great Pontif had the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream

but the Illiterate <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and
those who follow'd him, did never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what a <hi>Flamin</hi> was: neither has it
any appearance of likelihood, that the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
would have compos'd a Name of Greek
and Latin words, as being ignorant of both
the Tongues.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns the Subjection of
the Scots Bishops to the Archbishop of <hi>York,
Holinshed</hi> can never evince from any appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Author, Englishman or others, that
there was any Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> at that
Time, or for some Ages after; and if it
were not that I hate to engage in an useless
Controversy, I will undertake to prove from
English Authors, that we had Bishops in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> before they had any in <hi>Britain,</hi>
and that <hi>Palladius</hi> the first Scots Bishop,
preach'd the Gospel to us, before <hi>Austin</hi>
preach'd to the English. What credit those
things deserve which were writ before <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
or <hi>Bede,</hi> they themselves shall bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
for <hi>Bede</hi> does plainly own, <hi>that the
English received the first Rudiments of Piety
from the Scots;</hi> and <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> who hath
writ three Books of the Actions of the English
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52199:70"/>
Prelates, says, <hi>That he was almost destitute of all
kind of help, that he grop'd his Way through the
dark Paths of Ignorance, nor had he any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Light of History to direct his Path;</hi> and
yet this Author of ours according to his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual

which is to treat of Fee and Homage,
and temporal Things, and not of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Affairs, which depended on the Will

               <p>As to what <hi>Severus, Augustus, Maximia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
and other Roman Generals did, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
against us, it does not at all belong
to the <hi>Brittons,</hi> who must certainly have
very little Merit or Glory of their own,
when they rake together the Praises due to
other Men on all sides, and apply them to
themselves. But <hi>Ethelverd,</hi> than whom the
English have scarcely a more antient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
says, That <hi>when</hi> Claudius <hi>and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

can, in what Author or Book he ever read,
that the Scots swore Fealty, either to the

it could not be sufficient for three Nations

things without any Authority, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so ridiculous which this Man does not
look upon as an Oracle, so that it does but
afford him an occasion of venting his Spite
against the Scots. But I cannot perceive how
from all those famous Actions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
against us, <hi>Holinshed</hi> can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that the Scots were subject to the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Carausius, Holinshed</hi> concludes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which makes for the question in Hand;
but I wonder he did not also feign that he
subjected the Scots, for without doubt if
either his Memory could have suggested it,
or that his froward and arrogant Mind could
have feign'd or adulterated any thing, he
would never have omitted it. But what I
said before, appears evidently in <hi>Carausius</hi> or

perhaps yield that they were driven out of
the Island, because they were not accustomed
to Servitude; but that it was for Rebellion,
we constantly deny, there being no other
Authority for it but <hi>Holinshed</hi>'s, for they
never swore Fealty to the Romans, nor were
they overcome and drove out of the Island
by the Romans alone, but by the Conspiracy
of four most powerful Nations, the <hi>Romans,
Brittons, Picts</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Auxiliaries, who
combin'd together for the destruction of one
Nation, and that no very great One: but
this hapned by the cunning of the Romans,
I confess, under a Pretext of dividing the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> among their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
but when they were ejected, and
that the Romans design'd the same Thing
against the <hi>Picts,</hi> the latter perceiving the
Craft of this <hi>Leonine</hi> Confederacy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
themselves for their impious War

they never obeyed any Prince but their

and in fine, that they did never own
a Foreigner as their Lord or Superior, but
that those Scots who were so often beat, so

maintain'd and do still maintain their Royal
Dignity without Diminution; whereas the
<hi>Brittons</hi> who were both richer, more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,

               <p>BUT when the Romans left the Island,
then it quickly appear'd which of the
Nations were the best Warriors; for the
<hi>Britains</hi> being almost totally cut off by
the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> submitted to their Yoke,
and left them all the Country beyond <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
which we call on this side <hi>Humber,</hi> to
inhabit, because the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> were
not numerous enough to people their far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Provinces, which the <hi>Brittons did then
hold, and gratefully accept from the Bounty of
the</hi> Scots <hi>and</hi> Picts, <hi>paying Tribute to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
giving Hostages, submitting to them in
every thing Divine and Humane, and abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Protection of the Romans.</hi> Here are
all the true Marks of a Surrender, and so
the <hi>Britains</hi> yielded themselves to the <hi>Scots</hi>
and <hi>Picts,</hi> nor is there any room left for a
Subterfuge. <hi>Holinshed</hi> and the common
Herd of English Historians, give this as
the Cause of that Calamity, that above
100000 <hi>Brittons</hi> were carried away by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52199:74"/>
                  <hi>Maximianus,</hi> as he return'd into <hi>Gallia Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morica;</hi>
and most of them augment the
Number, but none that I know of does as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
them, and this number is also made
up by Women, Children and Servants. But
it appears, that a greater number of <hi>Scots</hi>
fell in the Field almost at the same Time,
under their Kings <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Fergus,</hi>
while they endeavour'd in vain to recover
their Country; then were carried over by
<hi>Maximianus</hi> into <hi>Britannia Armorica,</hi> of
which a great part did also return Home af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was slain. <hi>Holinshed</hi> passes over this
History very cursorily, when he asserts,
That all <hi>Britain</hi> was not subdued by the
<hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> but only some Provinces,
and that the principal part of the Island
was never touch'd by them; and here he
accuses our <hi>Boethius</hi> of a Lie, because he
says, that all <hi>Britain</hi> was surrendred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Scots did only seize the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north
<hi>Humber.</hi> Nor is it probable, says he,
That the Scots being but a poor and broken
Nation, and having lost their King with the
stoutest of their Souldiery, could in the
fourth Year after their return from Exile,
subject all <hi>Britain</hi> to their own Command;
for if that had been true, the Scots would
rather have chosen it for their Habitation,
than to have liv'd amidst Frost and Snow at
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52199:74"/>
Home. All this he alledges, to lessen the
Credit of <hi>Boethius</hi>'s History, which detracts
from the Fame and Dignity of the <hi>Britains,</hi>
tho the same thing be contain'd in all the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of that Age, <hi>Paulus Diaconus, Gildas,
Bede, Marianus Scotus,</hi> and all the Writers
of British Affairs, <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth, Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
Westminster,</hi> and all who ever wrote
of those Times, write clearly concerning
this Affair, and assert, that all <hi>Britain</hi> was
subjected to the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> and as to
what he says, of the improbability that the
Scots who were so lately defeated and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
should in so little a Time recover so
much Strength and Courage, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
to mind how many Armies of Scots were
defeated by <hi>Edward</hi> I. and yet they never
laid down their Arms, until in two pitch'd
Battels by the <hi>Humber,</hi> or at <hi>York,</hi> which
is situated on the Banks of that River,
they put <hi>Edward</hi> II. to flight at that Time,
the most potent King of <hi>Britain, Ireland,
Wales,</hi> and a great part of <hi>France.</hi> Nor is
it without Ground, that <hi>Lucan</hi> says, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
is fruitful in Men: So that if <hi>Holinshed</hi>
had considered these things, he would have
ceased from Wondring. Therefore <hi>Britain</hi>
was truly surrendred to the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi>
and the Surrender accepted; and the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
after they had in vain sought for the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52199:75"/>
Assistance of <hi>Aetius</hi> the Roman Legat by
Tears and lamentable Complaints, submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Yoke, not willingly I confess,
but being thereunto compell'd by Force of
Arms. And thus they continued for thirty
Years, and since that Time our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have always pretended a Right to
<hi>Northumberland, Westmoreland</hi> and <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which was the occasion of many Wars,
as we shall hear afterwards; but the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
growing weary of the continued and
grievous Servitude, they sent for Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from <hi>Britannia Armorica,</hi> whence
<hi>Holinshed</hi> writes, that <hi>Constantine</hi> came
with an Army, who kill'd <hi>Dongardus</hi> King
of <hi>Scotland</hi> in Battel, and recover'd <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
This is the third King of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
who in a small interval of Time fell as
fighting gallantly in the Field, that being
look'd upon as honourable and familiar to
our Kings: for it is brave and honourable,
says the <hi>Lyric</hi> Poet, to die for ones Country;
and others of our Kings have followed
their Examples, which <hi>Holinshed</hi> objects as
a Disgrace to them: But he will find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
amongst his <hi>Britains</hi> which relishes so
much of true Nobility; nay nor amongst
the English are there many Kings to be found
who died in Battel, unless it was during the
Heptarchy, while they rag'd mutually against
one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:52199:75"/>But that we may return to the <hi>Armori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or People of <hi>Little Britany; Holinshed</hi> says,
that <hi>Constantine</hi> of that Country recovered
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and was made King of all <hi>Britain:</hi>
But how could he recover that which he
never lost, especially seeing <hi>Dongardus</hi> fell
a Conqueror, which the Britains had felt to
their no small damage, except he had been
followed by a cowardly Successor? <hi>Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</hi>
will have this <hi>Constantine</hi> to be descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from <hi>Brutus</hi> in a direct Line, and to
have been Son to the King of the <hi>Lesser Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany.</hi>
But <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> writes,
that he died without having done any thing
of note, and left Children behind him, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,
Ambrosius</hi> and <hi>Vter;</hi> under whose
Conduct he says that the Britains fought
with the Scots, and obtained a Victory:
What Manner of Victory it was, in what
Place obtain'd, or who were the Generals,
there's not one word; but it must needs
have been a very small Victory which did
neither advance the Britains, nor depress
their Enemies. Would any Body offer such
Fooleries as real Matters of Fact? But the
Truth is, that the Scots were neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
by those of <hi>Little Britany, Constantine,
Aurelius</hi> nor <hi>Vter;</hi> but held the Soveraignty
of the Island until the Saxons, being hired
by the Britains, dispossessed them of that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52199:76"/>
Part of <hi>Britain</hi> which was a Roman Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince:
And that <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius</hi> did not
come into <hi>Britain</hi> before <hi>Hengist,</hi> appears
by <hi>Hengist</hi>'s Oration to <hi>Vortigern;</hi> which is
exhibited by <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster.</hi> But
to set this whole Matter concerning the
Auxiliaries from <hi>Little Britany,</hi> in its true
Light; whatever <hi>Holinshed</hi> and <hi>Geffrey</hi> of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> may fabulously assert, when
the Britains were repulsed by the Romans,
and did unwillingly fall off from them, they
consulted about chusing a General against
the Scots and Picts, and pitch'd upon <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern;</hi>
who finding himself unable to sustain
so great a Burden, whatever <hi>Holinshed</hi> may
say, perswaded them to hire the Saxons
to undertake the War for them: which had
been altogether needless if <hi>Scotland</hi> had been
subjected and recovered before; for none
use to desire Assistance, who are able of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to maintain War.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Holinshed</hi> alledges, that <hi>Vortigern</hi>
gave <hi>Galloway, Annandale,</hi> and the <hi>Mers,</hi>
which were Scotish Provinces, to be inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by the Saxons; it's according to his
usual Manner, and against the Credit of all
Historians, who have left it on Record that

was granted to them. And as the English
Writers themselves testify, when the Saxons
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52199:76"/>
understood the Fruitfulness of the Island,
and the cowardly Temper of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
and that <hi>Kent</hi> was not sufficient for
the Souldiers that arrived daily, that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist</hi>
obtain'd the Countries which lay upon
the <hi>Humber</hi> from <hi>Vortigern,</hi> that his People
might fix there and prevent the Entrance of
the Enemies into <hi>Britain.</hi> Neither were the
Saxons so very dull as to chuse such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
as were not fertile for their own Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and to leave the most large and

whole Island, as the Event did quickly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify.</p>
               <p>But this is not to be pass'd over, that
though all Historians agree that those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
were given to the Saxons, yet they
make no mention of any <hi>Homage</hi> or Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority,
or that the Britains reserv'd any Claim
of <hi>Fealty</hi> over those Countries to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
A most certain Argument that there
was not any Name or Memory of <hi>Homage</hi>
then, or for some Ages after in <hi>Britain;</hi> and
therefore whatever mention there is of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>
or <hi>Fealty</hi> perform'd by the Scots du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

there were ever any such, it is vain and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous,

of Wight,</hi> and the Eastern Parts of <hi>Britain,</hi>
by the Bounty of the Britains; but neither
did they own them as their Lords upon that
account, nor pay them any Homage, there
being no such thing then in being. And <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidore
Virgil</hi> does not only suppress all that is
said concerning those Auxiliaries from <hi>Little
Britany;</hi> but also says, that <hi>Vortigern</hi> being

this Advice to bring in the Saxons. <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Scotus</hi> has nothing of those Auxiliaries
from <hi>Britany;</hi> which this Man advances as
the most certain Truth: Neither is there
any mention of them found in <hi>Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s,</hi> whom I prefer to all Men on
this head; and yet he neither takes any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them nor of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> though he was
born at that Time, so that nothing could be
hid from him. Nor does <hi>Bede,</hi> who liv'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, and wrote a true and brief History
of those Times, though he takes notice of
<hi>Vortigern,</hi> say any thing of those Auxiliary
Britains; nor of that <hi>Constantine</hi> whom this
Jugler avers to have slain the King of <hi>Scots</hi>
in Battel. <hi>Ethelverd</hi> does not call <hi>Vortigern</hi>
King, but says that he was esteemed as such
by all Men: And none of those Authors
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52199:77"/>
take any notice that the Scots were either
beat, or divested of the Empire of <hi>Britain</hi> by
any other than the Saxons: But that by the
Advice of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> whom they chose King
in a tumultuary Manner, upon the Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Romans from the Island, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to hire the Saxon Auxiliaries that they
might bear the Burden of the War: And all
of them testify that the Saxons after their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
in the Island, under the Conduct of
their Captains <hi>Hengist</hi> and <hi>Horsa,</hi> were never
defeated nor dispossessed; but having sent
for their Fellow-Souldiers from <hi>Germany,</hi>
they quickly drove the Britains into <hi>Wales;</hi>
and first founded one Kingdom, then a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and at last a Heptarchy, or Seven
Kingdoms. And therefore what this Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
dreams of <hi>Vortigern</hi>'s having subdued
<hi>Scotland</hi> by the Help of the Saxons, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
them of the Islands, which were the
common Refuge of the Nation, are so vain,
that they are not worthy of a Confutation;
for he hath feigned all those things himself,
without the least Authority or Evidence:
and if it be not so, let any Body who espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
his Quarrel name but one Author, and we
shall yield. <hi>Bede,</hi> the only Writer of those
Times, has not one word of those things:
but this Author thought that he might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
forge, feign, and invent what he pleas'd,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52199:78"/>
so he did but tear the Scots with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives.
But how could <hi>Vortigern,</hi> who
was inferiour to the Scots in War, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the Kingdom by gross Wickedness, as
Historians write, for which he was hateful
to his own Subjects, bring the Scots under
his Yoke? For <hi>Vortigern</hi> after he had call'd
in the Saxons, was first deserted by all his
own Subjects, and then dethron'd, his Son
<hi>Vortimer</hi> being set up in his Stead, according
to their own Historians. <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi>
do both mention <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius,</hi> who
succeeded <hi>Vortigern,</hi> and fatigu'd the Saxons
by War; but they call him a Roman, and
the only surviving Person of the Roman
Blood, and own that he obtain'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
of <hi>Britain,</hi> that Part of it I mean
that was a Roman Province: which is an
Evidence how unwillingly the Britains fell
off from the Romans. <hi>Malmsbury</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi>
of <hi>Huntington</hi> say the same; and <hi>Paulus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aconus</hi>
writes, that this <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
the Purple; that is, took upon him
the Imperial Dignity in <hi>Britain.</hi> But this
Man being resolv'd to make War with the
Truth, would rather follow <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
in his History, than those Authors of
approved Credit and Reputation. What he
hath writ concerning <hi>Vter</hi>'s having subdued
and recovered the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52199:78"/>
of the like nature; for if his History be true,
the Saxons never gave him so much time to
breathe as to think of invading <hi>Scotland;</hi>
and being, in fine, deluded by them, and
harass'd with War during his whole Reign,
if he had any, he was neither honoured by
his own Subjects, nor taken notice of by the
Saxons. Whereas he says, that the Scots
entred into a Bond of Friendship, and join'd
in War with the Saxons, he is foully mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
to say no worse; for <hi>Palladius,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Bede,</hi> obtain'd from the Scots,
who had receiv'd many Injuries from the
Britains, and were therefore thinking upon
Revenge, that they should nevertheless join
in Arms with them, because the Saxons were
at that Time bitter Enemies to the Christian
Religion; and <hi>Polidore</hi> follows <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de</hi> in this.
Here we may observe the Virulence of this
Man against the Scots: For whereas <hi>Bede</hi>
hath left it behind him in Writing, that the
Saxons entred into a League with the Picts,
and join'd their Arms to subdue the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
this Juggler turn'd it upon the Scots,
as if they by joining with the Saxons, had
made War upon the Britains; when on the
contrary, as <hi>Polidore</hi> ingenuously confesses,
<hi>Constantine</hi> the King of <hi>Scots</hi> being invited
by the Saxons, refus'd to join them, and sent
Assistance to the Britains; which was the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52199:79"/>
only thing, as he says, that supported the
British State for some time at least, and kept
it from immediate Ruin. So that there is
nothing farther from Truth, than to say that
<hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>igern</hi> or <hi>Vter</hi> did reduce the Scots by
War: For besides that those things are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
without any Authority, Evidence or
Probability, <hi>Vortigern</hi> being worsted in the
War, call'd in the Saxons: and it is very
unlikely that the Britains should invade the
Scots after the Arrival of the Saxons, when
they were not able to defend themselves
from that Cruel Enemy, but by the Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thanks we have for our Kindness to the
most ungrateful of Men, that we must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
as having made War upon them, when
we sustain'd them by our Arms for some
time, and kept them from present Ruin.</p>

               <p>LET us now come to <hi>Arthur;</hi> who, as
he says, did not only subdue the Scots,
but according to our own Historians redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

but he names no Body, as fearing to

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>'d in a manifest Untruth. There are
not so many Scots Historians, that we need
to be ignorant what any of them says; but
none of them did ever convey such mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Lies to Posterity. There are some,
who being led into an Error by the English,
do write many great and magnificent things
concerning <hi>Arthur:</hi> But that he subdued
<hi>Scotland,</hi> demanded Homage or Fealty from
the Scots, or set his Kinsman <hi>Angusianus,</hi>
who was his own Sword-bearer, over them,
there is neither any English-man nor Scots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
except <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> alone, who
hath committed it to writing. But that Man
must needs be more than ordinarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent,
who hath once leap'd over the
Bounds of Modesty. But there are many
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52199:80"/>
things which move me either to think that
there was no <hi>Arthur,</hi> or that at least he was
not King of <hi>Britain:</hi> For, as the English and
Scotish Historians assert, <hi>Hengist</hi> came into
<hi>England</hi> with his Saxons in 449. They and
the Britains fought at <hi>Bansdown</hi> in 498, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
49 Years after <hi>Hengist</hi>'s Arrival. And
<hi>Gildas</hi> says, that he was born in that Year.
<hi>Monmouth, Westminster,</hi> and those who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, say that <hi>Arthur</hi> began to reign in
516, being then but fifteen Years of Age;
and that he was advanc'd to the Throne,
though unlawfully begot, because of the
great Opinion which Men had conceiv'd of
his Vertue: therefore we easily collect that
<hi>Arthur</hi> was born in 501, three Years after
<hi>Gildas.</hi> And <hi>Polidore</hi> does plainly say, that this
<hi>Arthur</hi> died in the very flower of his Youth;
being afraid of the Indignation of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
if he had writ nothing of him. From
those things it is evident, that <hi>Gildas</hi> was
three Years older than <hi>Arthur,</hi> and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary:
But this <hi>Gildas,</hi> a very great
Lover of Truth, when he deplores the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of the Saxons, and the Destruction and
Cowardice of his own Country-men the
Britains, he has not one word of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
<hi>Arthur,</hi> whose subject he was,
<hi>viz.</hi> a Britain born under a Britain; and
speaks not so much as one word of him in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52199:80"/>
Jest or Earnest. Which so great a Man
would never have been guilty of, if any such
Personage as <hi>Arthur,</hi> famous for so many
Great Actions, had liv'd in his Time; who
did so often put the Saxons to Hight, and
drive them out of <hi>Britain.</hi> Neither does he
ever write, that the Saxons yielded to the
Britains after their Arrival; but that having
enjoyed the Government in <hi>Britain</hi> with
<hi>Hengist,</hi> they divided the Kingdom amongst
themselves in his Life-time, and made it their
Country. <hi>Polidore</hi> has so great an Esteem
of this <hi>Gildas,</hi> that he says there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which he abhorr'd more than Lies,
and that there was nothing more familiar to
him than Truth. <hi>Bede,</hi> than whom there
is not a more true and uncorrupted Writer,
and who at that Time was not only the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Ornament of Learning in <hi>Britain,</hi> but
in all <hi>Europe,</hi> has nothing of this <hi>Arthur,</hi>
though he liv'd but 160 Years after him,
(for he flourish'd <hi>Ann. Dom. 700.)</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
in an accurate History, all the Fights,
Battels and Skirmishes betwixt the Brittons
and Saxons. Neither is he mentioned by
<hi>Florence of Worcester,</hi> nor <hi>Ethelverd,</hi> the
most antient Historian of those Times next
to <hi>Bede. Newbriggs,</hi> in the Preface to his
History, says in express Terms, that `where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52199:81"/>
                  <hi>Arthur</hi> and <hi>Merlin,</hi> and though all those
things concerning them are feigned by
Counterfeits, yet that Man (meaning <hi>Gef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>
of <hi>Monmouth</hi>) hath publish'd them to
entertain Mens Curiosity. <hi>Malmsbury</hi> does
indeed make mention of him, yet not as a

But as for the Roman Historians, they never

of those Times, nor in any French Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.
Nay <hi>Cooper,</hi> an English Writer, does
ingenuously confess, that the Actions said to
be done by <hi>Arthur,</hi> agree with none of the
Historians of those Times, although by them
he is rendred famous for his Exploits, as

none in the World, but were subject to the

Therefore whatever is writ concerning <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi>
is both fabulous, and justly so repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

But let him if he can produce any Historian

the Story of 1700 Years, so as to lead our

that he professes himself to be only a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator:
it's true indeed, but it's only that
he may cheat us with more safety and secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,

never any settled Form of Government in
the British Republick, neither in <hi>Vortigern</hi>'s
Time, who first brought in the Saxons;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52199:83"/>
nor after him was there any establish'd King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
until the Time of <hi>Aureli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who was of Roman extract, and at length
chosen King or General (for I find him
named both ways) in a tumultuary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by the <hi>Britains,</hi> who began, though
too late, to repent the bringing in of the
Saxons, and depriv'd <hi>Vortigern</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<hi>Aurelius</hi> made War upon the
Saxons for some time with various success;
and that he might strengthen himself on all
sides, he gave his two Sisters in Marriage,
<hi>Anna</hi> to <hi>Lothus</hi> King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> and <hi>Ada</hi>
to <hi>Conranus</hi> General of the Scots Army,
who was to succeed his Brother in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and by their Assistance he did for some
time bear up the ruinous State of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi>
After his Death, when the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fell by Law upon <hi>Lothus</hi> his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that the <hi>Britains</hi> set up one <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
in his place, <hi>Modredus, Lothus</hi> his
Son, pursuing his right by Arms, had a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and fatal Battel with the <hi>Britains,</hi>
wherein he died, though Conqueror: Hence
follow'd irreconcileable Feuds betwixt the
<hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Britains,</hi> and that League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> for the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Britains,</hi> who though they
were for some time assisted by the Scots, (for
<hi>Palladius</hi> obtain'd from <hi>Constantine</hi> King of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52199:84"/>
the Scots, that he should not desert the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
though he had receiv'd many Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
from them, nor join with the Saxons,
tho they promis'd great things, because they
were Enemies to the Christian Religion) yet
they were at last subdued and forc'd into
<hi>Wales;</hi> and not only lost the Royal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
(if ever they had any) but were
constrain'd to abandon the most fruitful
Provinces of their Country to the Enemy,
which they might perhaps have enjoy'd to
this Day if they had sincerely cultivated
their Friendship with the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts.</hi>
Let this suffice as the first Example to our
Neighbours, that they don't, from an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Ambition, endeavour to invert the
true Succession of the Crown, and prefer
some of their own Country-men right or
wrong. For <hi>Modredus</hi> was Heir of the
British Monarchy, if they had any such, and
his Posterity as far as <hi>Hungus</hi> King of <hi>Picts</hi>
carried the same Right; and <hi>Hungus</hi> dying
without Issue, the Succession of the <hi>British</hi>
and <hi>Pictish</hi> Crowns devolv'd upon <hi>Alpin</hi>
King of <hi>Scots,</hi> who was his Nephew by

What answer to return I know not, but this

And there's nothing more frequently read,

and the <hi>Britains</hi> being acted by the like

to <hi>Malgo,</hi> he says, That he gave <hi>Lothian,</hi> a

was not a Scotish Province, but belonged
to the Picts. Nor would what he designs
follow thence if it had; for granting that
<hi>Malgo</hi> had given some part of <hi>Scotland</hi> to
<hi>Ethelfred</hi> for a place of Habitation, it
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52199:86"/>
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be concluded from thence, that the
King of <hi>Scots</hi> paid Homage to <hi>Malgo,</hi> nay,
the contrary is to be inferred from the Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
Law, <hi>viz.</hi> that if <hi>Malgo</hi> had had any
Superiority over <hi>Scotland,</hi> he lost it by this
very Act, in making the Condition of his
Vassal worse than it was, without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and taking away part of his Fee; for
according to the Feudal Law, as the Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
cannot encroach upon his Lord's Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
so neither can the Lord hurt his
Vassal, or diminish any thing of his Fee
without his Consent. But what do I argue
thus with this <hi>Holinshed,</hi> who according to
his own Confession is altogether ignorant of
the Law? But the impartial Reader may

               <p>
                  <hi>Malgo</hi> reign'd only five Years, in
which time being defeated by <hi>Ethelfred</hi>
with a great Discomsiture, he was scarcely
able to defend his own <hi>Wales.</hi> He was
moreover a Person so hateful to God and
Man, for the unheard-of sorts of Lusts
which he brought into <hi>Britain,</hi> that there is
not the least Shadow of Probability, that
ever he thought of seizing or distributing
other Mens Provinces. And at last I set

that he should not attempt in vain what
Fate had forbid him, for his Country should
fall into the Enemies Hands, and be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
a long Time after by his Posterity,
as <hi>Polydore, Holinshed,</hi> and the rest of the
Common Historians have it, which may be
much better accommodated to King <hi>Iames</hi>
VI. than to <hi>Henry</hi> VII. for neither does it
appear, that <hi>Owen Teudor</hi> was descended
from the Race of the <hi>Welch</hi> Kings, nor is
there any one who can deduce his Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
from them: But <hi>Walter</hi> the first of the
Family of the <hi>Stewards,</hi> which now reigns,
is descended from them. But whether that
Oracle did regard the said <hi>Walter,</hi> or <hi>Henry</hi>
the seventh, it's certain that it hits in the
most Serene Prince <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth, who
is the undoubted Heir of both, by both
Lines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:52199:88"/>So much concerning the <hi>British</hi> Kings and
their seigned <hi>Homage,</hi> which nevertheless, as
I observed before, was not known in <hi>Britain</hi>
before the Conquest, or at least before the
Year 900; therefore whatever is said or writ
concerning the <hi>Homage</hi> before that Time,
is so inconsiderable, that it does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a Confutation, or if they have any
Author of this <hi>Homage,</hi> by whom they can
defend themselves, let them name one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Conquest, who made any mention
of <hi>Vassal, direct or profitable Lordship, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
Fealty, Fee Liege, or Fee it self,</hi> and
we shall yield the Cause. As to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the <hi>Brittons</hi> after the arrival of <hi>Iulius
Caesar,</hi> (for before his Time we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to say) it is certain that they were
always under the Roman Yoak; and when
they went away, all the Histories of that
Time do testify that they became tributary,
and gave Hostages to the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi>
for thirty Years together: Nor is there any
English Author who hath not express'd
that very thing. And that they might shake
off their Yoke, they invited the Saxons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Island, by whom they were far more
grievously oppressed, expell'd their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and driven into <hi>Wales,</hi> which at last
they could not retain neither; but falling
under the Power of the English, the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:52199:88"/>
lost all Royal Name and Dignity in the
Island for ever.</p>
               <p>We must also consider in this Cause, as
a Thing which gives very great Light to the
Question, what it is that an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ient Authors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by the Name of <hi>Britain;</hi> for when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>Holinshed</hi> reads, that any of his ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Kings did reign over all <hi>Britain,</hi> forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he supposes, that they did at the
same time command over <hi>Scotland,</hi> seeing
that is a part of <hi>Britain:</hi> but as <hi>George
Bucha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> hath observed, it is certain that
the antient Writers did by the Name of
<hi>Britain,</hi> understand only that part which
was inhabited by the <hi>Britains,</hi> and inclos'd
within <hi>Severns</hi>'s Wall as a Roman Province.
I shall add some single Instances, instead of
many, out of <hi>Gildas, Bede,</hi> an anonymous
Author, and <hi>Geffrey</hi> himself, besides those
which are cited by <hi>Buchanan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gildas</hi> when he writes of the Destruction
and Conquest of <hi>Britain,</hi> understands it
only of the Conquest and Destruction of
his own Country; for <hi>Scotland</hi> was neither
conquer'd nor destroyed, there having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been any Man yet, who could truly
boast that he had conquer'd <hi>Scotland. Gef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>
writes, <hi>That</hi> Cadwallo <hi>King of</hi> Britain,
<hi>chas'd the Saxons beyond the Wall, which was
built betwixt</hi> Britain <hi>and</hi> Scotland. <hi>Bede</hi>'s
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52199:89"/>
words are, <hi>Neither was there any of the Kings
of Scots who durst enter</hi> Britain <hi>to infest the
Saxons, after that fatal Battel of</hi> Aidan <hi>the
King of</hi> Scots <hi>with</hi> Ethelfred: but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that King <hi>Aidan</hi> and his Scots, did se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
inhabit that part of the Island which
is called <hi>Scotland,</hi> both then and afterwards.
And a little after, the same <hi>Bede</hi> says, <hi>There's
a Place near the Wall Northward, by which
Wall the Romans encompass'd</hi> Britain <hi>from
Sea to Sea:</hi> Therefore <hi>Britain</hi> was then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an Island as inclosed with a Wall. I
pass by many other Instances, lest I should
be tedious to the Reader; but it appears
from what has been said, that when we find
it mentioned concerning any one, that they
reign'd over <hi>Britain,</hi> there's nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whatever <hi>Holinshed</hi>
may aver, who deals unfairly in many things:
for when in his History he affirms, That
the Scots did not arrive in the Island be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Reigns of <hi>Honori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s;</hi>
and that he has the History of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<hi>Scots</hi> Kings from us, there being
no Englishman, for what I know, that
writes concerning our Affairs, (<hi>Bede</hi> it's
true, makes mention of <hi>Reutherus,</hi> but he
confesses that it was not his design to write
the Scots History) yet nevertheless <hi>Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</hi>
perverts the whole. If it be writ that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52199:89"/>
the Brittons made War upon any of our
Kings, then straightway <hi>Holinshed</hi> asserts that
they were beaten, conquered, implor'd Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and perform'd Fealty and Homage: If
they would not submit, then they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
by the Brittons; and that because of
the innate Treachery of the Nation, and their
continual Rebellion: But if they did any
thing that was gallant, he either adulterates
the same, or passes it over in silence; such is
<hi>Holinshed</hi>'s Candor towards us in his History,
and such his Fidelity in relating Matters of
Fact.</p>
               <p>Neither is this to be omitted, that if the
Kings of the Brittons had any direct Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
or Superiority over <hi>Scotland,</hi> it certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fell with their Monarchy, according to
the Maxims of the Feudal Law: For it is a
most certain Rule in that Law, that by the
Destruction of the thing from which a Fee is
held, if so be it happen without the Vassal's
Concurrence, as by Fire, Earthquake, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of the Earth, Inundation, or be seiz'd
by an Enemy, or otherways, <hi>the Fee and
Lordship</hi> ceases, and becomes extinct. But
that the Monarchy of the Brittons, to which
this Homage was due (according to <hi>Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed)</hi>
is destroy'd, and their Country over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
by an Inundation of Enemies, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52199:90"/>
and therefore this supposititious Right
of Superiority is also by the Rules of the
Feud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l Law extinguished with the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
of the Brittons, to which it was due and
appertain'd. But let us suppose that it is not
ceas'd, then it must needs devolve upon the
Posterity of <hi>Brut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> and not upon their most
bitter Enemies, who depriv'd them of their
Country, Life and Liberty: And if it be so,
the King of <hi>Scots</hi> is the only Survivor of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>'s
Line I think fit to admonish the Reader
of this one thing; That all those Matters if
they do any way refer to the Question in
hand, are alledged by <hi>Holinshed,</hi> without
any Author, probable Reason, or Likelihood:
And indeed this is a very strange thing, that
he should be so ungrateful to his Authors as
not to think them worthy to be named:
And it's also wonderful that any Men, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for Experience and Learning, of which
there is no small Number in <hi>England,</hi> should
listen or give Credit to any of those Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures;
for that which is not founded upon
any certain Authority, deserves no Credit
amongst honest Men. But I suppose he was
afraid to name his Author, lest the Matter
should not have succeeded according to his
Desire; and in that case, if the quoted Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
should have denied him his Patronage,

               <p>HAving gone through the Time of the
British Monarchy to see if there were
any Footsteps or Token of this <hi>Homage</hi> to
be found, the first Army of Instances which
were rashly led up by <hi>Holinshed,</hi> consulting
their own Safety, betook themselves to their

remains for us to attack the second Army of
Instances, which he brings from the Time of
the Saxon Monarchy, to try whether any
thing can be found in them to confirm this
<hi>Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>entitious Homage.</hi> This Saxon Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
began about the Year 450, and lasted
about 600 Years, till the Time of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
In all which time, that there was no
<hi>Homage,</hi> no <hi>Benefit</hi> for which it was due, no
<hi>Superiority,</hi> or <hi>direct or profitable Dominion,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52199:91"/>
Dominium directum vel utile,</hi> I have made
manifest in the first Proposition. In Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
whereof I add this, that if the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
English Laws before the Conquest,
printed at <hi>London</hi> under the Title of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
be seriously perus'd, it will appear that
there is no mention of <hi>Fee,</hi> without which
there can be no Homage: For as to <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi>
who by our Writers is said to be the
first that received <hi>Homage</hi> from <hi>Malcolm,</hi> or
as they say <hi>Constantine</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> for the
Principality of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmoreland,</hi>
he liv'd only one Age before the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
and I suppose that our Authors did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
follow the Custom of the Age when
they wrote, than of that wherein those
things were transacted. But of <hi>Athelstan</hi> we
shall say more afterward. The Writer of that
Time, and the Transactions which hapned
therein, is <hi>Bede,</hi> who died <hi>Ann. Dom. 733.</hi>
and that by his Death, the History of that
Time was lost, is testified by <hi>Malmsbury,
Florence of Worcester,</hi> and him who wrote the
Prologue to the first Book of <hi>Malmsbury</hi>'s
History. But whether it was <hi>Malmsbury</hi>
himself or another, he confesses ingenuously
that the History of 223 Years was lost;
which if they be added to the Years of <hi>Bede</hi>'s
Death, reach to 956. Betwixt which, and
the Time of <hi>Bede</hi>'s Death, it is certain from
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52199:91"/>
the Testimony of the English Writers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that all their History was lost: and
that therefore no Credit is to be given to
those who assert whatever comes uppermost,
or alledg any other things than what <hi>Bede</hi>
transmitted to Posterity. But those who
would have themselves to be believ'd as to
the Transactions of those two Ages and a
half did not live till <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's
Time, which was about 1170; that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
400 Years after those things were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
concerning which they write. The ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
is <hi>Ethelverd,</hi> who liv'd in 1090; and
whether it be fit to believe those Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
things which happened so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they themselves were born, especially
when they have no Authority but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Men whom they esteem'd worthy
of Credit, I submit to the Judgment of those
who are any way vers'd in History.</p>
               <p>But here some may object, that they had
Chronicles whence they might excerpt those
things. It's true, that the Chronicles did use
indeed to take notice of the Year and Reign
when such a thing happened; but omit
Causes, Reasons, Circumstances, and other
things which are of most note in History:
Or if they have any unsuspected Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
who attests this Homage, let them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him, and we shall grant then the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52199:92"/>
But whence they had those things which
they wrote, and what they understand by
Chronicles, I shall dispatch in a few words;
and from one History, which was much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
by them, according to the Custom of
those Times, we may make a Conjecture of
the rest, that all Men may perceive how f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their Reasons, and how vain those
Monuments are which they use, or rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
in a Matter of so great Weight, to
weigh down the Truth which we have on
our side. I have in my Custody a History of
those Times in Manuscript, so stuff'd with
Fables, Miracles and Monsters, that it must
needs raise the Contempt of any Reader.
The Author is uncertain, but it is certainly a

                  </gap> and Drousiness, than to
seign something which they thought worthy
to be remembred? Therefore one set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
about the History, or rather Romance,
of <hi>St. Cuthbert:</hi> Another about that of St.
<hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Beverly:</hi> A third about that of St.
<hi>Bridget,</hi> or some other tutelary Saint to whom
their Church was dedicated; which they set
off with all manner of Counterfeit Fables and
Ornaments that could be invented. To
this was added a Cart-load of Miracles; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the Saintship of him, in whose
Name their Church was consecrated, was in
hazard to be called in question: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it behoved them to feign, that by their
Influence either the Danes were drove back
to their Ships, or that the Scots were routed
and broken, or had made a Surrender of
themselves. Nor did they think that they
sinn'd in so doing, for they call'd it only an
Officious Lie; and the more notable the
Fiction was, they were held worthy of the
higher Dignity, and look'd upon as Persons
of more than an ordinary size of Piety. Then
they were admir'd by the ignorant Friars,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52199:93"/>
and reverenc'd by following Writers. At
last, when the Government of a Monastry
became vacant, such an Author alone was
reckoned worthy to succeed; which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to the propitious Name of his tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
Saint. When I was at <hi>Paris,</hi> I saw in
St. <hi>Genevieve</hi>'s Church at the High-Altar, her
Atchievements finely painted; and amongst
other things, it was feigned that by her
Prayers she had beat off the English from
the Siege of <hi>Paris,</hi> routed them, chas'd 'em,
and chastis'd them with innumerable Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities:
though no English-man did ever ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hear or see that <hi>Paris</hi> was besieged by
the English; and <hi>Genevieve</hi> her self was
dead many Years before the Reign of the
English, for she died at <hi>Paris</hi> about 80
Years old, <hi>ann. 513.</hi> as is witnessed by <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew
of Westminster.</hi> But those Writings ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once pleased the Ears and Minds of the
common People, were esteem'd as true; so
that if any Man durst but mutter against them,
he was forthwith look'd upon as an Heretick
and Enemy to Piety. Nor is <hi>Bede</hi> himself,
though a most Learned Man, free from this
Crime of believing Lying Miracles; for
there are so many of them inserted in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
that they derogate from the Credit of
what is true. If no Fable of a Saint oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd,
then they describ'd <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52199:93"/>
as <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who wrote
five Books of things that were never trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted;
or they forg'd some new <hi>Gildas,</hi> that
the New History of <hi>England</hi> might have
something of Probability: and so those
Writings of the Monks coming to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd,
were desired by others that they
might be copied; by which Means they
were fill'd with Mistakes, partly by Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of Transcribers, and partly out of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to advance their own Religion, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
their Country, or out of favour to this
or the other Man, who had done them a
Kindness, or enrich'd their Churches. From
the Text of those Legends, or Chronicles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as the Vulgar us'd to call them, <hi>Malmsbury</hi>
and <hi>Florence</hi> collected their Histories; and
omitted nothing that was fabulous or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive
to promote either the Dignity of
their own Country, or the Ecclesiastical
State; and if they say otherwise, let them
produce any one Author or Chronicle which
is not made up of things transacted at least
200 Years before he was born who writes it:
And how is it possible that he who did not
live till so many Years after, should be able

should be publish'd, that we may see with
what Clouds of Darkness we were encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
in the Time of Popery: for what
danger can there be, says he, in repeating
those Fables and Dreams? Certainly if any
Man be drunk and bewitch'd with Monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Dotages and Fables, they will both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them and the Author: And a little
after he says, <hi>But for my part, as often as I
fall upon those Monkish Fables and old VVives
Tattle, I am mightily pleas'd with them;</hi> and
yet these are the Writers by whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52199:94"/>
we are run down: So much says he in
his Preface. For as it appears by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seript
of <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> all Monks
were accounted irreconcileable Enemies to
Truth, and such as were accustomed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

those Writers liv'd in a Time when nothing
was more hateful to the English than the
Name of a Scotsman; and therefore they
thought it their Glory to forge whatever
they could against the Scots, seeing they
might not only do it without fear of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but did also either reap actually or
at least conceive Hopes of having great
Profit by it: And they did afterwards ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at that height of Impudence, that either
by adding to, or diminishing from Authors,
they did most wickedly make them patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Superstition, there was nothing which
the Monks would not forge, which could
either enrich the Ecclesiastical Order, or
advance the Pope above all Kings, and
make him Soveraign of the Universe; and

Law, <hi>de sim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:52199:95"/>
Why should we not think that they would
turn every thing that occur'd into a Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick
of their own Prince, so they could but
render him Soveraign of the whole Island?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuvenal</hi> is certainly in the right, when
he says in his third Satyr,
<q>
                     <l>Graeculus esuriens in coelum jusseris ibit,</l>
                     <l>A hungry Fellow will do any thing to have
his Belly full.</l>
                  </q>
And in that same manner, those <hi>Court-Dogs</hi>
do continually fawn upon their Masters, that
they may procure some Morsels to stay their
ravenous Stomachs. But here the English
will object, that if we refuse this sort of
Evidence, what is it that will satisfy us, or
what Proofs do we require in a matter of
this Importance, to make the Truth of
that <hi>Homage</hi> manifest? I answer, that as I
have no regard to the Testimony of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
Monks, so I maintain, that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative
is only to be proved by authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Charters and Monuments (kept in the
Archives) under the Hand-writing of both
Kings, and no otherwise: Nor is the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
of one sufficient without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing
of Indentures, or attested Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viates,
as we call them in the Feudal Law;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52199:95"/>
for that is not sufficient for one of them to
salute another, by the Name of his Lord
or Coheir in a Missive Letter, this not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enough to make either the one Lord,
nor the other Heir; nor if there be some
such assertory Letters, as <hi>Paulus de Castro</hi>
speaks<note n="*" place="margin">In sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mario.</note> is that sufficient: for says the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Philip, Domestick Instruments, private
Testimonies or Annotations, are not good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
Proof, if they be not supported with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Circumstances</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta, ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note>. Now what can be
writ or said more weighty against the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of those Monks, or their Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Times which they call Chronicles?
<hi>Bodinus</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Lib. 1. de Repub.</note> testifies, that all those <hi>Homages</hi>
which were performed either by the King

in the Archives. Then let <hi>Holinshed</hi> Show
me any one such if he can; or if we must
believe Witnesses, I wish he could tell me
of any <hi>Pandulphus,</hi> who was sent as his

should ever pretend to that Crown any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
than by the Bounty and Good-will of

those of sixteen Earls, besides others that were
present.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they can show us that ever any such
thing was perform'd by the King of <hi>Soots,</hi>
or received by the King of <hi>England,</hi> they
shall readily obtain our Affirmative to this
Question. But they are also to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that Charters alone are not sufficient
to confirm this; for though they should
agree, that the one shall be <hi>Lord,</hi> and the
other <hi>Vassal,</hi> yet except there be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
Benefit, there cannot be any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;
for Homage is always accompanied
with Benefit, as the Sun is with a Shadow;
or as we say in Relatives, the one without
the other is inconsistent, as I have observed
before. They who have the least know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Feudal Law, must confess those
things to be true; for if there be no Benefit
granted me, how can I owe Service, or
with what Confidence can the Lord demand
Military Service or Homage, from him who
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52199:96"/>
is not obliged to him by any manner of
Bounty? for when the Bounty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eases, the
Homage does also cease. But that <hi>Scotland</hi>
was the Benefit or Gift of <hi>England,</hi> or the
English Kings, there's no Man as I conceive
will be so Impudent as to assert; for if so,
who gave it? Who receiv'd the Investiture?
Where are the Monuments or Indentures?
When did we receive this Benefit? In what
Century or Olympiad? Long before the
Name of <hi>Bugland</hi> was known, we had many
Kings in <hi>Scotland;</hi> nay some of them pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
<hi>Britain</hi> it self. As to what concerns
the Kingdom of the <hi>Picts,</hi> it cannot be
called their Benefit, for that we acquir'd
by our own proper Valour against their
Will, they having taken Arms in defence
of the <hi>Picts;</hi> so that <hi>Scotland</hi> cannot be
call'd a Benefit of <hi>England,</hi> by any Man
who hath not bid defiance to Truth. But
they will say that there's another way of
acquiring Fealty and Homage, <hi>viz.</hi> by Force
of Arms; for it may so happen, that a King
who is routed and conquered, may surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himself up as a Vassal to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and hold the Kingdom in Fee of him
which was Free before, and perform Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to him upon that account. To
which I answer, that this is contrary to
the Nature of a Fee, for a Benefit ought
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52199:97"/>
not to be acquir'd by Force and Violence,
but by Liberality and Munificence, and a
Benefit (<hi>Beneficium</hi>) is the Genus of the
Thing defin'd in a Fee (<hi>Genus de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>initi est
in Feudo</hi>). But of this Instance there is no
Example: For in all <hi>Europe</hi> there's no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
(at least in Clientelary Kingdoms)
which was acquir'd by Arms. Indeed the
Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> V. or as some will have it
<hi>Frederick I.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> was at first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, that it might be a Fee of the Empire.</note> created a King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> out
of his own Patrimony, who did thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
perform Homage to him about the Year
of God, ... but this did proceed
meerly from wicked Ambition; for the
Emperor perceiving that there were divers
Kings in <hi>Europe,</hi> who would scarcely yield
to him in Point of Dignity, that he might
be reveng'd upon them in some measure,
and show, that he could do that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
could not; he would create a King,
but one that should be his Vassal, for which
he had no Precedent, neither can any Man,
in so far as he is King, have another King
under him; that of <hi>Martial</hi> is known,
<q>
                     <l>Esse sat est Servum, jam nolo Vicarius esse</l>
                     <l>Qui Rex est Regem maxime non habeat.</l>
                  </q>
And it is a Maxim in Law, <hi>Par in parem non
habet Imperium, i.e. Equals have no Command
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52199:97"/>
over one another;</hi> but the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi>
had his whole Kingdom out of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Empire, and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
perform'd Homage.</p>
               <p>The Anti-pope <hi>Anaclet</hi> the second, in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
of the Emperor's Ambition, and
that he might also have Kings for his Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals,
created the Duke of <hi>Apulia</hi> King of
<hi>Naples,</hi> and impower'd him to make use of
the Regalia, as a Fiduciary Client of the
Patrimony of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> as they call it, to
which as they alledg all <hi>Italy</hi> belong'd by
the Donation of <hi>Constantine.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> founded at first, that they might hold in Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salage of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> Therefore
the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> holds in Fee of the
See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and pays 50000 Ducats year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by way of Covenant. And in like
manner <hi>Manfred</hi> was invested King of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,
because he had taken it by Force of
Arms from the <hi>Saracens;</hi> and because this
noble Island being taken from the <hi>Saracens</hi>
had no Soveraignty, the Pope adjudg'd it
to the Patrimony of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> but so as
<hi>Manfred</hi> should be King under the Vassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of the Roman Pontif, out of whose
Patrimony he would have it to be thought,
that the said Benefit was granted. Now
those Kings receiv'd their Kingdoms, from
the Bounty of the Emperors and Popes;
and so those Kingdoms were originally
founded, that they should hold in Vassalage,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52199:98"/>
and perform Homage upon that Account:
But here was nothing effected by Force nor
Arms, and they are the only Kings who
hold in Vassalage in <hi>Europe;</hi> except some
have a Mind to say, that the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and their Successors were made Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> not by Benefit,
but by the Papal Arms, that is to say, by
Curses and Excommunications, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Vatican. The King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
indeed acknowledges the Emperor as
his Lord for <hi>Ditmarsh,</hi> and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
pays him Homage and receives his
Investiture, but for <hi>Denmark</hi> he owes
neither Fealty nor Homage to any Man.
And the Kings of <hi>England</hi> swore Fealty
and Homage to the French King, so long
as they enjoyed <hi>Anjou, Poictou, Aquitain,</hi>
and the rest of the Provinces beyond Sea;
but those being taken away, the Homage
ceased, for the Benefit ceasing as the Cause
of the Homage, the Homage it self must
of necessity cease also. Neither is it usual
for Conquerors to leave the Royal Title
to the Conquered Kingdom: <hi>Britany</hi> was
call'd a Kingdom formerly, but after it was
subdued by the French, they laid the Name
of Kingdom aside. When the <hi>Welch</hi> were
brought under by the English Power, they
were forbid to chuse any more Kings; and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52199:98"/>
it was the like as to <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by five Kings when conquered by
the English; who were all of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to quit that Royal Title, and for the
most par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> assum'd that of Earls; so that
fourfold Division of the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>
amongst the Sons of <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
any of them return'd to the antient
Patrimony, their Title of Kingdom became
antiquated: and indeed in my Judgment,
there's no such thing to be found in all
<hi>Europe,</hi> that one King should have another
for his Vassal, although the same be not
unusual to Emperors and Popes, who arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
to themselves a Superior Power.</p>
               <p>I know that the Kingdom of <hi>Castile</hi> did
sometimes pay Homage to the King of <hi>Leon,</hi>
and <hi>Portugal</hi> did the same to <hi>Castile;</hi> but
<hi>Castile</hi> was originally no more than a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
or County of the Kingdom of <hi>Leon,</hi>
and <hi>Portugal</hi> a part of <hi>Castile.</hi> Nor did
their Princes at first assume Royal Dignity
to themselves, lest they should be forsaken
by their first Patrons; but when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to reign in good earnest, and that their
Royal Title was confirmed, the Homage
did also cease as is witnessed by <hi>Roderick
Sancius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But lest we should seem to be altogether
contentious, we will grant, though they
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52199:99"/>
can never force us to it neither by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
nor Example, that a King may be
compelled by Arms to acknowledg another
as his Lord, and receive the Investiture
of his Kingdom from him, as a Beneficiary.
Let us go through the whole Time of the
Saxon Monarchy, which stood for about
600 Years, as I have already said, and see
if any thing occurs which bears a Shadow
of Probability, that ever the King of <hi>Scots</hi>
was so brought under by the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as either to make a Surrender of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto him, or receive a new Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his Kingdom from him: and in

               <p>THE first Monarchy of the English
Saxons in <hi>Britain,</hi> was founded by
<hi>Hengist</hi> himself, and preserv'd with a great
deal of Difficulty; so that from him we
were in no Danger; he being engaged in
War with the <hi>Britains</hi> during his whole
Life, and falling in the same at last. He
was succeeded by his Son <hi>Esca</hi> or <hi>Osca;</hi> and
Auxiliary Forces arriving daily from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
when once they were inform'd of the
Nobleness of the Island, they continued the
War with the <hi>Britains;</hi> and having driven
them into <hi>Wales,</hi> divided the Province a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves into seven Kingdoms,
the Countries being shar'd according to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one's Merits; so that all the Time of
this Heptarchy, they had a Domestick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to contend with, and the Point in
controversy was not, which of them should
Govern, but which of them should Live:
For the <hi>Britains,</hi> though they had the justest
Cause of War that could be, yet being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to the Saxons in Valour and Strength,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52199:100"/>
and forc'd to retire into the Mountains and

                  </gap>ually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
the Territories of the English Saxons
with their Inroads, whereas they were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
themselves by the natural Strength of
their Country, and did also possess the
Counties which lay next to them, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a fair Opportunity offer'd, they did
not decline Fighting, Anger and Grief for
the loss of their Country inspiring them
with Courage, while Fortune and their own
Valour favour'd the Saxons: So that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this whole six hundred Years, one
War begat another, without any mention
of Peace, both Nations fighting eagerly;
nor in all this time could the <hi>Bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>us,</hi>
who was the last they had, did in some
measure oblige them to surrender; and
since that time there have been no Kings
in <hi>Wales,</hi> or the Antient <hi>Gambriu,</hi> yet they
were not entirely subdued till the Time of
<hi>Edward</hi> the first: It may be indeed that a
Truce happened sometimes by mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but they never laid down their Arms,
the one striving to regain their antient
Country, and the others to retain it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> being thus repuls'd, though
not conquered, a far more insupportable
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52199:100"/>
Mischief fell out amongst the Saxons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>viz.</hi> Civil Wars which were bloody
to that degree, that the Conqueror seldom
gave any Quarter to the Conquered, but
did rage against one another with mutual
Butcheries: And thus these following Princes
and their Armies were slaughtered, <hi>viz.
Ethelfred by Redval, Oswald by Penda,</hi> and
<hi>Penda</hi> by <hi>Oswy,</hi> Brother to <hi>Oswald,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of his Brother's Death. I could name
many others, but it not being my design to
write the Story of the Heptarchy, I shall
only add, that thus they exercised their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
upon one another by mutual Discomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
until the rest of the Heptarchy's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
suppressed, the whole Province submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Government of <hi>Egbert,</hi> about the
Year 800: He was the first who would have
<hi>Britain</hi> called <hi>England,</hi> by the Name of his
own People; and the <hi>Britains</hi> in the mean
time keeping up their Arms, was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Cause of this uniting among the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for being too weak for the <hi>Britains</hi>
apart, the Saxon Commonalty did the more
readily agree to submit themselves to the
Government of One; that so with their
united Forces, they might the more easily
repel the <hi>Britains:</hi> then seeing for that
whole space of four hundred Years, they
had an irreconcileable Enemy at Home,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52199:101"/>
and destroyed one another with mutual
Slaughters, who can believe that they did
ever so much as dream of invading or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
<hi>Scotland;</hi> they had Wars and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enough at Home, but no Cause of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
against the Scots. <hi>Ethelfred</hi>'s Victory
over <hi>Aidan,</hi> which is related by <hi>Bede,</hi> makes
nothing against this Proposition, for it was
<hi>Aidan</hi> who provok'd the Saxons, and had
already settled himself in <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
that he might assist the <hi>Britains</hi> against
them as became a true Christian, though he
had very just Causes of being offended with
the <hi>Britains;</hi> yet by the Influence of the
Bishops, he was not only withheld from
taking Arms against them, but chose rather
seeing they profess'd the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to join with them against the Saxons,
the Common Enemies of Christianity; and
therefore it could never so much as once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into <hi>Ethelfred</hi>'s Mind to subdue <hi>Scotland.</hi>
But we shall give an answer in a little Time
to those things which are objected by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshed.</hi>
It is therefore manifest, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
those four hundred Years, the Saxons
made no Hostile Attempt on the Scots, nor
never entred <hi>Scotland,</hi> or if they did, were
not permitted to make any long stay there.
But besides the Incursions of the <hi>Britains,</hi>
and their own Domestick Broils, and mutual
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52199:101"/>
Slaughters which ended in <hi>Egbert,</hi> the
English were attaqu'd with a new and more
grievous Judgment than all the former; for
the Danes upon the same Motives that the
Saxons entred <hi>Britain</hi> under <hi>Hengist,</hi> did
first infest the Coasts with Piracy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
hopes of enjoying the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
by observing the feeble Resistance
of the Saxons, who having gradually laid
aside their antient Fierceness, were grown
more Humane, they were encouraged to
land upon the Continent of <hi>Britain</hi> with
great Forces, and coming off Conquerors in
some Battels, were lifted up with the Hopes of
enjoying the whole Kingdom. <hi>Alfred</hi> oppos'd
them stoutly, and being oft-times beaten and
oft-times victorious, he did happily however
preserve the Government; and if we may
believe our Writers, being assisted with the
Scots Auxiliaries, he overcame the Danes
in a great Battel. But however that is, he
entertain'd a fair and sincere Friendship
with the Scots; for <hi>England</hi> had embrac'd
the Christian Religion about an Age or
two before, and therefore the Scots were
easily perswaded to join with them against
the <hi>Danes,</hi> who were bitter Enemies to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
All the time of this <hi>Alfred,</hi> the
Scots enjoyed <hi>Northumberland, Cumberland</hi>
and <hi>Westmoreland</hi> peaceably, as they had
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52199:102"/>
done from the Reign of <hi>Gregory,</hi> who had
taken them from the <hi>Britains</hi> and English;
although the English Annals affirm, that
they were freely granted to us by their King,
as a Reward of our joining in Arms with
them against the <hi>Danes.</hi>

and being free from the trouble of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

great Bounty towards the Scots, but
demanded the Restitution of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
from <hi>Constantine,</hi> threatning to take
them by force of Arms, except the King of
<hi>Scotland</hi> restored them willingly. <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s

according to the then Custom of the Scots,
gave a resolute Answer to <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
so that they betook themselves to
Arms on both sides. In the mean time a
new Army of Danes landed in <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland;</hi>
and having notice of this Discord,
they pour'd Oil into the Flames, allur'd the
Scots to abandon the English, and join
Arms with them: The unwary Youth did
easily agree to it, as taking it heinously that
those who had been so often relieved by
his Father's Arms, in their greatest straits,
should now take away the Reward of his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52199:102"/>

but his Valour was overcome by their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy;
for <hi>Athelstan</hi> had ordered his Men to
retire gradually, and counterfeit a Flight,
which the Scots taking to be real, broke
their Ranks, and pursued them until such

Prince where they had lain in Ambush, and
the rest returning to order of Battel, did
first put the Scots, who were eagerly fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to the Rout, and then the Danes; by
which Stratag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m the Conqueror did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
overcome <hi>Harold. Malcolm,</hi> the most
of his chief Nobility, and the stoutest of

into <hi>Scotland,</hi> no Man pursuing him; nor
is there any thing more false, than what
is asserted by the Common sort of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Historians, that <hi>Constantine</hi> was at this
Battel in Person. But when the Danes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
News of this Fight came in with Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
Troops from all parts, their Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
so mightily, that <hi>Athelstan</hi> perceiv'd
he was in hazard of losing all, if the Scots
should but join them with never so small
a Force, and therefore conceiving it to be
easier to please the Scots, because they were
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52199:103"/>
Christians, he first sent Ambassadors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the Friendship with them. The King
of Scots perceiving the multitudes of Danes
which arriv'd daily; and fearing that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had destroyed the English, his turn
should be next, he gave consent without
much Reluctancy: The conditions were,
that <hi>Westmoreland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland</hi> should
be granted to <hi>Malcolm,</hi> as a perpetual and
Hereditary Fee; <hi>Vpon which account he was
to receive the Investiture of those Countries
from</hi> Achelstan, <hi>and to do him Homage as his
Lord; and this is the first Homage that we
read of to have been perform'd in</hi> Britain:
which yet those ignorant Monks call a <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render</hi>
and not a <hi>Homage,</hi> because they did
never understand neither the One, nor the
Other: For the Names of <hi>Homage</hi> and <hi>Fee,</hi>
which had their first Rise amongst the Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards
and French, might have crep't into
<hi>England</hi> before that time, though the Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
Law had not as yet taken Root there.
As to <hi>Northumberland,</hi> because the Danes
did then possess it by Force, there was no
mention of it in the Agreement; though
the Scots did remonstrate, that unless it were
also restor'd, there could be no firm nor
lasting Friendship; but <hi>Athelstan</hi> excus'd
himself by the Pretext abovemention'd.
From his time, to the Conquest, there past
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52199:103"/>
130 Years, during which the Scots main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
an Inviolable Friendship with <hi>Edward,
Athelstan</hi> and the English; so as they drew
the Arms of the Danes upon themselves,
and hazarded their own Safety for that of
<hi>England.</hi> The Danes having laboured a
long time in vain to break this League, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to give <hi>Northumberland</hi> also to the
Scots, did at last attaque them with many
Armies, and were often Victorious; but
being at length overcome by <hi>Malcolm</hi> the
second in three most desperate and bloody
Battels, they were forc'd to return into
<hi>Denmark,</hi> and to oblige themselves by Oath,
never to return to <hi>Scotland</hi> in an Hostile
manner. Nor was <hi>England</hi> ever delivered
from intolerable Misery and Slavery, until
the Strength of the <hi>Danes</hi> was first broke
by the Scots; whose Victories procured
some Rest, and a breathing Time to the
English. Let all the Monastical Writers
be turn'd over and over again, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they fix the least Infraction of this
League with <hi>Athelstan</hi> upon the Scots; nor
did the English indeed break it, so long
as they were under any fear of the Danes,
so that with united Force they did gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
bear up against the Power and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> which
did then strike a Terror into all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52199:104"/>
of <hi>Europe,</hi> as we shall by and by make
it appear from the Antientest Monuments
of <hi>England:</hi> This is the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact, and disagrees very little in any
thing from the Monastical Writers, if they
be rightly understood, but only that they are
very faulty in their representations of the
Form and Causes of Transactions, as shall be
made manifest anon. We shall now come
to those particulars, which are objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us by <hi>Holinshed,</hi> from the English
Saxon Kings, but so as to discuss those
things which are matter of Fact, before we

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52199:105"/>
that all Men may see how unfaithful <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshed</hi>
hath been, in writing his History.
This <hi>Ethelfred,</hi> says he, King of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
afflicted the <hi>Britains</hi> more, made
greater Devastations in their Country, and
took more Land from them than all the
other Saxon Kings. He fought with <hi>Aidan</hi>
(whom he calls <hi>Eden</hi>) King of Scots, such
a terrible Battel, that though <hi>Aidan</hi> was
defeated, and fled beyond the Wall; yet
<hi>Ethelfred</hi> lost his Brother <hi>Theobald,</hi> and the
Army which he commanded: But the King
of <hi>Scots</hi> durst never after that hazard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Battel against the English, while
<hi>Ethelfred</hi> liv'd. And he adds afterwards,
that <hi>Ethelfred</hi> made a terrible Slaughter of
the faithless <hi>Britains;</hi> and yet <hi>Holinshed</hi>
has the Impudence to charge us with Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousness,
and to assert, that <hi>Ethelfred</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
all <hi>Scotland,</hi> (such is the Veracity
and Nature of the Man) whereas <hi>Bede</hi>
takes notice, that he never entred <hi>Scotland,</hi>
but contented himself to exercise his Arms
against the <hi>Britains;</hi> nor does <hi>Gildas</hi> make
mention of any such thing: So that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at this Man's boldness, who without
any Author, nay, against the Authority of
the greatest Writer in those times, dare so
rashly advance such a manifest Untruth, as
that the Scots were subdued by <hi>Ethelfred:</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:52199:105"/>
Or let him cite me any other Historian, if
he can, who is to be compared with <hi>Bede</hi>
for Faithfulness or the Preheminence of
that Time: <hi>Holinshed</hi> in his History indeed,
where he does somewhat consult his Credit,
passes by all those things. It is not so much
as true, that <hi>Ethelfred</hi> was slain by <hi>Cadva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
but by <hi>Redval</hi> the King of the East
Saxons. But that all the Saxon Kings were
subject unto, or did serve <hi>Cadvanus</hi> or
<hi>Cadwallo,</hi> is monstrous to assert: And I
wonder <hi>Holinshed,</hi> (for to you henceforth
shall my Speech be directed) that your
Country-men the English Saxons don't break
your Face, for such a notorious Fiction.
For it is certain that the <hi>Britains</hi> were at
that time depriv'd both of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Soveraignty by the Saxons, with
whom they did never entertain any Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oswald</hi> and <hi>Oswin</hi> you jumble together;
the one you say, overcame and subdued the
Scots at <hi>Cadwallo's</hi> Command, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
according to you, did not only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
them afresh, but kept them under sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
for twenty eight Years, both of
which are false; and though it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
neither of them is sufficient to prove
the Homage: For that <hi>Oswald</hi> and <hi>Oswin,</hi>
after their Father <hi>Ethelfred</hi> was slain, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52199:106"/>
his Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland</hi> seiz'd, did
fly into <hi>Scotland,</hi> you your self bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as do also our Annals, and all those
that write of <hi>Oswald</hi> and <hi>Oswin.</hi> Nor is it
credible that they would have chosen <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
for a Place of Retreat, if so many Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
had past, and such an inveterate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
had continued betwixt <hi>Aidan</hi> King of
Scots, and <hi>Ethelfred</hi> their Father. Or <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan's</hi>
Goodness must needs be commended
by all Men, who not only entertain'd the
Sons of his most Capital Enemy, and
vouchsafed them his Protection, against the
Murderer of their Father; but did also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them in true Piety, and the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, which the Saxons had not at
that time receiv'd, and gave them likewise
the best of other Breeding; and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland</hi>
by his means, they converted their Subjects
to the Christian Religion, by the help of
the Scots Bishops. Nor were there ever
any Princes who had a greater Veneration
for the Scotish Name, or observed a more
inviolable Friendship with them; as being
mindful of the Kindnesses which they had
received in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Neither do you your
self in your History, nor <hi>Bede</hi> before you,
make any mention, that ever <hi>Oswald</hi> made
War upon the Scots. That which led you
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52199:106"/>
into the Error of asserting that <hi>Oswin</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<hi>Scotland,</hi> I suppose to be this of <hi>Bede,</hi>
who says, that <hi>Osuin</hi> did for the most part
subdue the Nations of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi>
(who inhabit the North of <hi>Britain</hi>) and
render them Tributary; but of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
(says he)<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lib. 2.</note>. But having spoke then
occasionally of <hi>Oswin,</hi> as he was writing
the History of <hi>Edilbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> he
refers the true Account of the Matter to
that Place, where he was to treat of <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win's</hi>
History, and his words there are, That
the same <hi>Oswin</hi> after <hi>Penda</hi> was slain, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
the Kingdom of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and
the rest of the Southern Provinces; and
did also subject most of the Pictish Nation
to the King of <hi>England</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 3. Cap. 24.</note> Let those two
places be compar'd together, the one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Bede</hi> treating on another Subject, says,
That the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> were for the most
part subdued; and the other wherein he
only mentions the <hi>Picts;</hi> and any Body
may easily perceive, that the latter is the
Explication of the former. But that he
subdued the Scots, or made them submit to
his Government, <hi>Polydore</hi> makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor do you your self, <hi>Holinshed,</hi> in your
History. It's certain that <hi>Oswin</hi> liv'd in a
very good understanding with the Scots.
But the <hi>Picts</hi> having broke their League with
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52199:107"/>
the Scots, and being left to themselves, were
grievously harass'd by the Northumberland
Saxons: yet nevertheless, they held the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
still, and did afterwards cut off <hi>Egfrid</hi>
King of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and his Army.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Polidore,</hi> Lib. 4.</note>
But he has nothing concerning the Tribute
of the Scots, nor the Homage, nor any thing
whence that Homage can be inferr'd. Altho
our Historians do disagree from <hi>Holinshed,</hi>
as to the Truth of the History: As to the
League betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Achaius,</hi> which hath cost us so much
Blood, we shall speak anon.</p>
               <p>We acknowledg that K. <hi>Alpin</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
taken, and beheaded by <hi>Brudaeus</hi>
King of the <hi>Picts;</hi> and that his Head was
fastned to a Pole over the Gates of <hi>Camelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunum:</hi>
But though you should declare it
upon Oath, that that inhumane and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Act was done by the Command of the
King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> I will not believe
you; although I own that the Picts received
Assistance in that War from his Auxiliary
Troops. Indeed to betray his Vassal to his
Enemy, to desert him in a just War, and
to assist his Enemy with Auxiliary Forces to
oppress his Vassal; and last of all, to take
Order that his Head should be publickly
fastned to a Pole, was not the part of a Liege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lord.
Those things do plainly argue that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52199:107"/>
there was no such Band of Society or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
at that time, betwixt the Scots and the
English, as is requir'd betwixt Lord and Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal;
but if there were, the King of <hi>England</hi>
deserved to be depriv'd of his Superiority
for ever, because of his Cruelty against his
Vassal. Nor can you bewray the inveterate
Rancour of your Heart against the Scots,
more than you have done in writing this;
which yet makes nothing towards proving
the Homage. But the Story is known: For
whereas the Right of Succession to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the <hi>Picts,</hi> after the Decease of their
K. <hi>Hungus</hi> without Children, did by Law
fall upon his Uncle <hi>Alpin</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> there
did flow hence more than capital Enmities
betwixt the two Kingdoms; who fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
one another with such virulent and
embittered Minds, that there was almost no
Quarter given on either side. <hi>Alpin</hi> came
off Conqueror in the first Battel; but being
afterwards defeated and taken, they cut off
his Head: but, according to your wonted
Candor towards us, you wilfully pass over
what was the Issue of this Affair to the Picts,
(for such a prodigious Piece of Wickedness,
and their Violation of the Laws of War);
who being overcome in two or three Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
by <hi>Kennethus, Alpin's</hi> Son, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger
of his Father's Death, not withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52199:108"/>
the Assistance which they receiv'd from
the English, they were totally destroy'd; and
their City of <hi>Camelodunum,</hi> where the Head
of that noble Prince was publickly affix'd to
a Pole, (the most prodigious and heinous
Breach of the Law of Nations from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World to that Day) was
raz'd from the very Foundations; so that
there is not the least Vestige thereof now to
be seen: And thus that most wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ul Disgrace
was expiated and revenged, by one which
was yet more woful. Nor were the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Pictish Nation, which was once
so famous among the Brittons and Romans,
and who cut off <hi>Egfred</hi> King of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
with all his Forces, so much as ever
taken notice of afterwards in any place of
the Earth; and their Kingdom devolved
upon the true Heir. Let this be the second
Warning to you, O People of <hi>England,</hi> to
preserve the Laws of Succession, instituted by
God himself, inviolable; and set always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>You write that <hi>Osbright</hi> and <hi>Ella,</hi> with an
Army of Britains and Saxons, did invade
<hi>Scotland,</hi> put the Scots to flight, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoil'd
them of the Countries by <hi>South Forth,</hi>
because they chose a King of themselves. We
confess all but the Cause of the War, for
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52199:108"/>
which you have no Author. But the Case
was thus: The Remainders of the Picts, that
they might raise up Enemies against the Scots
on all hands, transferr'd all their Right to
the Kingdom of the Picts upon the Britains
and Northumbrians, whose Kings being
join'd with the Remains of the Picts, defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Scots, who were much weakned by
their many former Battels with the Picts. But

that perhaps there was never a greater; it
was not so much owing to our Enemies Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
as to our own Negligence: For the
Scots having come off victorious, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that they had nothing more to do,
lay down upon the Grass, made merry in the
Enemies Camp, and betook themselves to
rest; and the English, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who were
watching for an Opportunity, having notice
of their Security by some Traitors, surprized
them asleep and without Arms, and cut
them almost totally off: However, though
they became victorious in this Manner, yet
they never demanded Homage; but satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves with the Countries on the
South of <hi>Forth,</hi> abstain'd from doing us any
farther Injury. But you have nothing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52199:109"/>
here nor in your History, concerning
Homage, Tribute or Subjection Mr. <hi>Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</hi>
We will grant you that the Scots were
routed, and left many of their Countries to
be inhabited by the Saxons and Britains;
but deny that they retired into the Islands, as
you will have it, seeing they had many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and the far better part of <hi>Scotland</hi> still
remaining. It's not our Purpose to maintain
that the Scots were never subject to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Fortune in War; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that both then and before, they were
often overcome, put to flight, and driven
out of some Part of the Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Countries by <hi>South Forth:</hi> But the same
routed and dispersed Scots, having re-assum'd
their Courage upon the Increase of the
Youth, did again make head against the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors;
and the Fortune of War changing,
did not only rout and chase, but drive them
beyond <hi>Humber;</hi> as shall be made appear
anon, when we come to speak of <hi>Gregory.</hi>
But this good Historian does so often take
notice of the Scots being beat, routed, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
reduc'd, and expell'd the Island, and
that with so much Precipitancy, that he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes
one and the same Act to two Kings,
that so we may seem to have been twice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated;
but never says one word how we
recovered our Country, and forc'd the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52199:109"/>
to quit it. Whereas, according to the
Laws of History, he ought to have recorded
the one as well as the other, or have pass'd
them both over in silence: It being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intolerable in an Historian to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate
the famous Atchievements of his
Country-men, and never to take notice of
their Overthrows and Defeats. But <hi>Holinshed</hi>
makes no mention of the total Extirpation
of the Picts, though assisted by the English;
such is his Candor towards Scots-men. Nor
can I but take notice of what he assigns as
the Cause of this War, that the Scots had
chosen themselves a King without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Britains and Saxons. Where, I
pray, and in what Author did you read
this? Or who ever writ that the Right of
Chusing our Kings belong'd to the Saxons
and Britains? When did this begin, and who
was the first that was chosen? For our Kings
are not so much as elected by our selves, and
far less by our Enemies, but come to the
Crown by Succession. Or if the Consent of
the Britains and Saxons were to be requir'd
in this Affair, you might have been pleas'd
to acquaint us whether this Respect was due
to them both conjunctly or separately; or
if separately, to which. But it is not worth
the while to confute this Man's Folly. This
whole Story of <hi>Osbright</hi> and <hi>Ella</hi> he has
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52199:110"/>
from our Historians, there being no English
Author who makes mention of <hi>Osbright's</hi>
Victory; but he perverts the whole Matter,
according to his usual Method.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Hungar</hi> and <hi>Hubba,</hi> I do not regard
them: It's true, they overcame the Scots,
though you have nothing of their Victory,
nothing of that Superiority nor Homage, in
your History. Neither do I see, though it
had been perform'd to them, why it should
be due to you: But the Danes perceiving it
dangerous to try the Fortune of War with a
fierce and hardy Nation, and liking <hi>England</hi>
better, because there they hop'd to find less
Resistance, and a larger Reward of their
Trouble, they left <hi>Scotland,</hi> and turn'd their
Arms against the English. To enquire into
the Issue of that War, makes nothing to the
Question in hand; but only that you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
that <hi>Constantine</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> who was
chosen to that Dignity by <hi>Osbright,</hi> being
slain by <hi>Hungar</hi> and <hi>Hubba,</hi> that <hi>Ethelwolph</hi>
to revenge his Death, took Arms against
them, and slew them both: But here are as
many Mistakes as Words; for it was never
so much as once heard of, that any of our
Kings did reign by the Authority of the
Kings of <hi>England.</hi> And as for <hi>Constantine,</hi>
he succeeded as lawful Son to his Father

<hi>Ethelwolph</hi> should revenge the Injury done

or if you have any, pray produce them:

we paid Tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> for it was never
neither written, painted, feigned nor heard,
that the Scots paid <hi>Peter-Pence: sed solatio
est miserorum habere pares,</hi> It's some Comfort
to have Fellows in Adversity; the English
not being able to deny, that they hold
their Kingdom in Vassalage of the See of
<hi>Rome,</hi> they would have us to be Partners
with them in the same Servitude. Nor is it
true that <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> was the first, who made
the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> tributary to the
Pope; for <hi>Offas</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and
also <hi>Inas</hi> did it before him: but no Body

either to the English, or the Roman Chair.</p>
               <p>Of the same Nature is that which you
subjoin as to <hi>Alured,</hi> who ordain'd, that
no Excommunicated Person should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Property of any Fee in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
and seeing the same Custom is still
observed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> thence you infer
that the Scots were Subjects of <hi>England,</hi>
but by the same sort of Argument that you
made use of formerly. But pray Mr. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshed,</hi>
was this the Statute of your <hi>Alured,</hi>
or of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which obtain'd
in all that part of the Christian World,
that submitted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as all
<hi>Britain</hi> did at that Time? And therefore
to infer from the Communion of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52199:111"/>
Discipline, that we were your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
is an ill way of arguing; for by that
same Argument, you may conclude, that
the whole Western part of the World were
your Subjects: but to this way of arguing,
I have answered twice or thrice already.
You write that the same <hi>Alured</hi> did install
<hi>Gregory</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and compel him to
break the League with <hi>France,</hi> which are
both your own Fictions, having neither
Author nor Evidence for it, no, not so
much as an Englishman; or if you have
any who hath recorded it, that <hi>Gregory</hi>
was install'd King by <hi>Alured,</hi> and forced by
him to dissolve the League with <hi>France,</hi>
name them. But which way could he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
him, who never attaqu'd him by Force
of Arms? For <hi>Gregory</hi> as the true Heir of
the Crown, and Son to <hi>Dongal,</hi> succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Kinsman <hi>Ethus,</hi> and was most fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in War; for having conquer'd the
Danes, and ejected them totally out of the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he applied himself
to recover the Countries besouth <hi>Forth,</hi>
which were then possess'd by the Danes,
who had dispossess'd the English that took
them formerly from the Scots, and cut off
<hi>Constantine</hi> King of the <hi>Britains</hi> with his
whole Army, because he would not part
with <hi>Annandale, Galloway,</hi> and the rest of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52199:112"/>
the Scotish Countries which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
in Conjunction with <hi>Osbright:</hi> And
<hi>Gregory</hi> afterwards seizing <hi>Cumberland</hi> and
<hi>Westmoreland,</hi> did also drive both the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
and Danes out of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> and
as he was about to besiege <hi>York<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Alured</hi>
finding himself not able to bear up both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Scots and Danes, reconcil'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to <hi>Gregory</hi> King of <hi>Scots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and gifted
him with all <hi>Northumberland,</hi> that he might
join with him in his War against the Danes,
at that time Enemies to the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and all the Inhabitants of <hi>Britain:</hi>
this Covenant intervening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,
Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> should
be for ever subject to the Scots; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both <hi>Gregory</hi> and his Brother <hi>Donald,</hi>
after his Death, did assist <hi>Alured</hi> with their
Arms. But this is a new way of arguing,
<hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Donald</hi> did assist the English
with Auxiliary Forces against the Danes;
therefore the Scots were at that time subject
to the English: This is a very sorry Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital
for so great a Favour. From that
time forward the Scots could never be
withheld from laying Claim to those three
Countries, either by Law or Arms; and
the English also reclaiming them, this did
continually administer Cause of Quarrel and
Discord betwixt the two Nations, as we
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52199:112"/>
shall hear by and by. This <hi>Gregory</hi> did
also subdue <hi>Ireland,</hi> which makes it so much
the less probable, that he who conquer'd
so many Nations and People, should be
compell'd by <hi>Alured</hi> to dissolve his League
with <hi>France:</hi> But what's all this to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
in Controversy?</p>
               <p>You do also assert, that <hi>Edward</hi> Son to
<hi>Alured,</hi> did overthrow <hi>Constantine</hi> King of
<hi>Scots,</hi> and force him to pay Homage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he conspir'd against him with the
Danes. <hi>Edward</hi> indeed being grieved that
so many large Countries were cut off from
<hi>England,</hi> and given to the Scots by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
would needs redemand them contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Publick Faith and Covenant; and
it may be that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> was forc'd
to join with the Danes. But to prove that
he receiv'd his Kingdom from <hi>Edward,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd

Falsehood, that it's very probable Truth
may run away from you, as afraid of you:
but I wonder who could suggest such things
concerning <hi>Marianus,</hi> to that Noble Prince,

there was in <hi>Marian:</hi> So that here you

and the third is in hazard of betaking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

writes, that he defeated and brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Subjection all the English, Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians,
<hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Britains,</hi> whom we now
call <hi>Welch,</hi> yet it is so plainly contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Truth of History, that <hi>Polydore</hi>
hath temper'd it thus, by saying, That he
obtain'd the Soveraignty of all the People
in the Island except the <hi>Scots. Florence of
Worcester,</hi> who is more antient than either
<hi>Hoveden</hi> or <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> says, That the King
of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Reginald</hi> King of the <hi>Danes,</hi>
did chuse this <hi>Edward</hi> the Elder for their
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52199:113"/>
Father and Lord, and entred into a League
with him: But what is all this to Homage,
Fealty, or Subjection, if such things
were either written or spoken to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of Duty or Merit? If any
one salute another by the Name of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
Father or Lord, shall we therefore
say, that he pays him Homage? <hi>Polydore</hi>
writes, that <hi>Edward</hi> made War upon <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
because he did continually make
Inroads upon the English Borders; that
this War was carried on with great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on both sides: but the Scots having
the greatest Loss, laid down their Arms
willingly; and having obtain'd a Peace
with the English, proceeded no further.
But neither <hi>Malmsbury</hi> nor <hi>Huntington</hi> say

is own'd by our own Writers; and to
this you add a base and contumelious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
that the Scots being corrupted by
Danish Money, did violate their Faith to
the English. And that your Honesty may
the better appear to all Men, you affix that
upon <hi>Constantine</hi> as a Blemish, which <hi>Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>

under the Notion of a Stage-Player, or Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
he entred and view'd the Camp of <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lassus</hi>
the Dane, and then return'd to his

mention this as a very great Commendation
in <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the Catholick, who did the like
in the Moors Camp: And what you affirm
of the Scots having been brib'd by the Danes
to break their League with the English, is
all of a piece. Histories do indeed make
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52199:114"/>
mention, that the Danes did at that Time
subdue a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> by Force of
Arms: But no Man, except he who has a
Forehead of Brass, and is arriv'd at the
height of Impudence, will assert that they
abounded so much in Money as to bribe Kings
and Nations with it. But to return to the
Matter it self: You say, Mr. <hi>Holinshed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that
we occasioned the breaking of the League;
and <hi>our</hi> Writers impute it to <hi>Athelstan,</hi> who
being unmindful of former Kindnesses, and
troubled that his Father and Fore-fathers
had granted the Provinces of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmoreland</hi> to the
Scots, demanded them back again, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
War unless they were willingly resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<hi>Malcolm,</hi> who was Prince of <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and declared Heir to the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
took this fierce Declaration yet more
fiercely; but being overcome by a Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem

was always to do Homage. But <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>
was exempted, as being then in
the hands of the Danes. Let us see then how
far our Writers and the English agree in
their Relations of this Affair. We own that
the League was broke (but by your Fault);
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52199:115"/>
and that <hi>Malcolm</hi> was routed, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of his Army slain: But in what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
we disagree. Our Historians say, that
<hi>Malcolm,</hi> a young rash Prince, was General
of our Army; and that <hi>Constantine,</hi> upon
the bad News of its Defeat, forsook the
Throne, and turn'd Monk. But all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Authors that I have read, say that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
was present in Person, and routed.
Neither do they agree as to this neither;
some say that he was only put to flight, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
say he was slain, and a third sort will
have it that he surrendred his Crown to the
English: so natural it is for those who do
once step aside from the Truth, the further
they go on, the further to go astray: Nay,
they do not so much as agree in the Place of
Battel. <hi>Malmsbury</hi> says they fought at
<hi>Brunefurd</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> some will have it
that they fought in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereas <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi>
never saw that Country: And others
give out that they fought at the Mouth of
<hi>Humber;</hi> whither they pretend that <hi>Avalas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
and <hi>Constantine</hi> his Father-in-Law, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
with a Navy. Which how like to be
true that is, every Body knows; for the
Scots were never Masters of such a Fleet as
they could entrust an Army with, nor had
they any need of it, seeing they could invade
<hi>England</hi> by Land at what part they pleas'd:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52199:115"/>
But as to any Homage perform'd at that
Time, there's not so much as one word in
any Historian. <hi>Polidore,</hi> who is the only
Man that hath writ the History of <hi>England</hi>
with Judgment, (but following the English
Annals) says, that <hi>Constantine</hi> swore Feal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>Athelstan;</hi> but whether it were for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or those beneficiary Provinces, he says
not. And <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> in that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his before-mentioned, says that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
was done, but never asserts it for the

says that Homage was perform'd, much less
for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Nor do any
of them so much as make use of the word
<hi>Homage. Polydore</hi> indeed affecting the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin

Fealty, or Subjection, to <hi>Athelstan; (Iuras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se

Homage from them. <hi>Iurare in Verba,</hi> is by

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52199:116"/>
                  <hi>Iurare in Leges,</hi> signifies one's obliging of

and whereas they may say, <hi>Polydore</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
use the Words <hi>jurasse in Verba</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
Homage, it's certain he affirms that
this Homage was constantly denied, and
sharply controverted by our Writers; but
that it did not belong to him to act the Part
of a Judg in this Affair, but only to write
what the most antient Annals say, without
giving Offence to either of the People. Nor
have you one English Historian, Mr. <hi>Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,</hi>
whom you can produce for the Truth
of this Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> that Homage was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
from <hi>Constantine:</hi> and tho some may
have left it in writing, that Homage was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;
and tho we should yield this freely,
and grant that to have been which never
was, yet there is none so void of Modesty
as to assert, that Homage was perform'd for
<hi>Scotland;</hi> for neither does the Nature of the
Benefit it self, nor the Circumstances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
allow that it could ever have been done
for <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was never part of the
English Patrimony; and Homage can never
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52199:117"/>
be perform'd without a Benefit: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I know not what to say as to those Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Writers, seeing they don't agree amongst
themselves neither, as to the Place, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
Event, nor Effects of that Battel: So
that it is manifest, as I took notice before,
that they have no English Writer of that
Time whose Authority they can produce for
<hi>the third Proposition;</hi> but that the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of 223 Years is perish'd, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have nothing of Certainty concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Athelstan's</hi> Reign, which fell within
that Period, but what is collected from Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives
Fables, or at best, from the Relation

As to what concerns the Surrender, (<hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem</hi>)
or entire subjecting of our selves,
which they upbraid us with here and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where

(<hi>dedere se hostibus</hi>) meant; and that they
never read <hi>

But they might however, have learn'd
from their own <hi>Polydore</hi>

Surrender of the Kingdom of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

to excuse <hi>Holinshed,</hi> and those Monks, that
they took the word (<hi>Deditionis</hi>) in a more

by them now and then in that Signification,
it may be tolerated; but if they do thence

accuse themselves of Ignorance and

Though after all, the English have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
who make any mention of the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the King or Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But
to return to our Purpose: The Truth of this
Story of <hi>Athelstan</hi> is to be sought for from
our Historians; who make no mention of
<hi>Constantine's</hi> having been in Person at the
Battel, or of his having been kill'd or taken;
but that upon receiving the ill News of the
unsuccessful Battel, he put on the Monks
Habit. The hot-headed Youth <hi>Malcolm,</hi>
who was declared Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being
improvident, did totally lose his Army, and
miss'd narrowly himself at that Time, as I
said before. And here Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> you
insult over us in a wonderful manner; and
assert that the Scots sold their Faith, and
treacherous Souls to the Danes; and that
they did never observe a Peace with the
English religiously nor faithfully: when at
the same time, the Rise and Occasion of this
Persidiousness, was in <hi>Athelstan</hi> himself. But
if you had as large a Field of Declaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, as the Britains have indeed of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
against your English Saxons, Mr.

               <p>But because the principal Hinge of this
Controversy turns upon <hi>Athelstan,</hi> and that
our Neighbouring Nation have nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to object against us during the Saxon
Monarchy; these things are to be more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discuss'd, that all Men may understand
whether the King of <hi>Scots</hi> paid Homage for
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or those Benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
Countries.</p>
               <p>We will freely grant then, which they shall
never be able to evince by any necessary or
concluding Argument (as we use to speak)
from their own Historians, that the King of
<hi>Scots</hi> did then pay Homage to <hi>Athelstan.</hi> So
that the Point in controversy must now be,
Whether the same was perform'd for the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which until that Time
was free, or for those Provinces which he
receiv'd from <hi>Athelstan,</hi> or had enjoyed in
<hi>England</hi> before?</p>
               <p>If they say for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi>
it is not any way probable that the Scots,
who were always most tenacious of their
Liberty, as appears by what hath already
past and is to follow, and who did constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prefer the same to their Lives, should so
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52199:119"/>
easily renounce, or abdicate that Liberty,
and enslave themselves of their own accord
under the Servitude of the English, a new
Kingdom and Nation: for <hi>Egbert,</hi> who was
no more than <hi>Athelstan's</hi> Grand-father, was
the first who gave it the Name of <hi>England.</hi>
The King of <hi>Scots</hi> was not reduc'd to such
Straits as to be obliged to part with his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
if he did not pay Homage for it: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it likely that <hi>Athelstan,</hi> who was
press'd upon by the Danes, and thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more advantageous to him than the
Friendship of the Scots during those Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
would redeem it by Conditions so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal,
and which tended to the everlasting
Reproach of the Nation; for he knew that
if such hard Terms were imposed, the Scots
would not be easily kept within the Bounds
of Duty: Whereas in truth, they continued
very constant in the League made with <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan.</hi>
Nor did they ever withdraw their
Friendship from the English, or disturb them,
during the Danish War; which in those
truoblesome Times, it had been easy for
them to do, and to have put in for a Share
of the Booty with the Danes. For seeing the
Danes alone, without the Assistance of the
Scots, did at that Time conquer <hi>England,</hi>
they cannot deny but the Accession of the
Scots would have been of some moment.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52199:120"/>
And <hi>Holinshed</hi> confesses, that the King of
<hi>Scots</hi> did serve in this War against the Danes
with ten thousand Men, which it is not
like he would have done without some Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit;
so that of necessity that Homage
must have been perform'd for those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in <hi>England,</hi> which he did then hold
in Fee of the English King, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland,
Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
which were added to the Scotish Kingdom,
by the Bounty of King <hi>Edward,</hi> for their
faithful Service in the Danish War.</p>
               <p>If you deny this Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> I will
produce <hi>Holinshed</hi> as a Witness against you,
whose words are these: <hi>In the time of</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>and his Son</hi> Athelstan, <hi>the Scots en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
part of</hi> Cumberland, <hi>and the North of</hi>
England; <hi>and by and by, that</hi> Edmund <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to</hi> Athelstan, <hi>did assign all</hi> Cumberland
<hi>to the Scots, for their Assistance against the</hi>
Danes. And <hi>Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>endo)</hi> be left
out by the Printer's Neglect, and the Sense
is not perfect without it. Don't you see
here Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> and <hi>Cumberland</hi> was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to the Scots, and an Oath of Fealty
thereupon demanded? But that <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Northumberland, Westmoreland,</hi> were
at that time in the Power of the Scots, is
not obscurely hinted by <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>den</hi> a Learned
and modest Man, and the most Judicious
of all the English Antiquaries: He <hi>says,
That</hi> York <hi>reviv'd again and flourished with
Riches, though it had been often destin'd to
destruction by the Scots.</hi> But how could the
Scots design that City to destruciton, or
enter so far into the Country, if they had
not been possess'd of the adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries?
And he does also take notice of the
Stone-Cross, commonly called <hi>Re-cross</hi> or
<hi>King's-Cross</hi> in <hi>Richmond-shire,</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which
was set up as a Boundary to both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
Though he does indeed confess,
that this was the Boundary, yet he will
have it, that it was fix'd in order to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Lands given by the several Kings to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52199:121"/>
                  <hi>St. Cuthbert,</hi> as Tutelary Saint, from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions
of the Scots, which has no shadow
of Truth. But the most express and clear
Testimony is, what he says in the Original
of the Scots: But says he, When the Scots
came to join the <hi>Picts</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they did continually infest our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men
(meaning the <hi>Britains</hi>) with War,
yet the Scotish Monarchy did not grow up
of a sudden, but they lurk'd a long time
in that Place where they arriv'd, until they
did totally exterminate the Picts; and
that the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland</hi> fell
by its intestine Broils, and the Incursions
of the Danes. Then, says he, all the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
part of <hi>Britain</hi> went under the Name
of the Scots, as did also that hithermost
part of the Country betwixt the River
<hi>Tweed</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh Firth.</hi> But <hi>Cambden</hi>
does not hit the Truth in all this, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Picts were routed out, the Scots
and they together did inhabit all that
part of <hi>Britain</hi> benorth <hi>Humber,</hi> and had
also the Soveraignty over the Rest, having
impos'd a Tribute upon it, and receiv'd
Hostages for it. There are also many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places in <hi>Cambden,</hi> which testify, that
<hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmoreland</hi> were then in
the Hands of the Scots: So that this second
thing is confess'd by both Parties, that those

the Scots held them against the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's</hi>
good Will is not very likely, nor is
there any English-man who would confess
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> though true; for seeing the Inhabitants
of those Countries were originally English,
they were not kept in subjection by the
Scots without difficulty, their inclinations
being always towards the English<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
rendred our Possession of those Countries
very uneasy; and the like happened in
<hi>

though either the whole, or at least the

the English of those Provinces; and
therefore to say that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
those Provinces, which were inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the English, against the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's</hi>
Mind, is both very improbable, and
against the Truth of History. And if we
possess'd them with his good Will, it must
of necessity have been the Effect of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence,
and by Consequence that we
held them in <hi>Fee,</hi> seeing a <hi>Fee</hi> is nothing
else but the gratuitous Bounty of the Lord
in favour of the Vassal, for which he is to
perform Fealty or Homage; for as I said
before, where there is a Benefit, there is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
but where there is no Benefit, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can there be any Homage: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it necessarily follows from those things,
that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> did owe that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
for <hi>Cumberland, Westmoreland,</hi> and
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> the Beneficiary Countries,
and if he perform'd it, what Wonder!</p>
               <p>And seeing there were not two Homages
perform'd, (for none of the Monastical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
do mention two) and that it appears
there was only One, let us enquire further,
(though it be plain enough from what is
already past) whether it was for <hi>Scotland,</hi>
or for <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and the other Provinces.
In all Paiments, Lawyers will have the
Paiment to be interpreted according to the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52199:122"/>
meaning of the Debitor, and that the Pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was made for that which the Debitor
said it was: But our Country-men when
that Debt was paid, did plainly express,
that they paid the said Homage for those
Countries. The English confess the Pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but suppress the Cause for which it
was made, that they may be at Liberty to
wrest it as they please. Yea, <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.
though he makes mention of this Homage
very often, yet he never affirms, that it
was for <hi>Scotland,</hi> except in the time of <hi>John
Baliol</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the first, of whom in the
following Chapter: and therefore the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and Interpretation of the Debitor,
and not of the Creditor, is to be receiv'd
in this Homage. Again, according to Law,
if Paiment be made without Addition of
what Debt it is for, the Paiment is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
rather for that which is uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
than for that which is; and if there
be two Debts, the one Certain, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Dubious, the Paiment is presum'd to
be for that which is certain, and not for
that which is doubtful. But no Body is
ignorant that it is controverted, whether
this Homage be due for <hi>Scotland,</hi> for though
the English do pertinaciously assert it, we
do as constantly deny it: that it was due
for <hi>Cumberland, Northumberland</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland,</hi>

follows: <hi>Athelstan</hi> being at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> and
doubting, as well he might, whether or not
the Superiority over <hi>Scotland</hi> was rightfully
due to him; he pray'd to God, not though
the Merits of Jesus Christ, but those of St.

forthwith drawn his Sword, He <hi>struck

in that Place, and made a great
Cleft in it;</hi> and, says the Manuscript which
I have in my Custody, <hi>the Stone cut as easily
as if it had been Butter or Bees-Wax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let the stubborn Scots go and elude
this Superiority, confirmed by so great a
Miracle, if they can, the Memory whereof,
says <hi>Holinshed,</hi> is still to be found in the
Stone at <hi>Dumbar;</hi> though some of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane

Laughter, and say, <hi>That the Author de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd

as a Truth by most of the English, and hath
occasion'd many, and particularly my self,
to wander among those Rocks, to see if
there were any Stone with such a Cut in it
to be found. There are things added no
less ridiculous, concerning <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Knife,
which was deposited on the Altar of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
of <hi>Beverly,</hi> at the Time of that Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> which he redeem'd again
with great Largesses and Endowments, when
he return'd victorious.</p>
               <p>But the History is plain in it self, that

                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:52199:124"/>
but not being able to maintain a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Danes and Scots both, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that the Scots would be more easily
reconcil'd than the Danes, who aim'd at
the Soveraignty of the whole Island, he
renewed his Friendship with the Scots, and
gave them <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmoreland</hi> to
hold of him, and so he who was design'd Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was call'd

English Writers call King of <hi>Cumberland:</hi>
but <hi>Athelstan</hi> could not restore <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
at that time, because it was possess'd
by the Danes. And thus our Historians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
on the Matter with the English Writers,
but only that the English enlarge too much
on this Victory, and vary from us in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances:
but however, this is apparent
from the History of both Nations, that the
Scots did faithful and gallant Service to the
English in the Danish War, and that their
Society and Friendship continued without
interruption, till the time of the Conquest,
as we shall make it appear by and by, from
the very Laws of <hi>England.</hi>

in favour of the Scots, because they
are in possession of their Liberty: for we
are not to believe English Monks, who were
at a great distance from the Place of Action,
ignorant of the Causes and Circumstances of
things, and built upon meer Rumours, in a
Matter of so great moment. But if any Man
can produce Deeds for this, writ by either
Party, or Charters, and antient Monuments,
corroborated by their Seals, as in the Case
of K. <hi>Iohn</hi> formerly mentioned, then they
have something to which they may give
Credit: But though they should produce
the Testimonies, or Depositions of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
English Monks for the Dignity of their
Prince, their Country, or Themselves, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
so many Years after the things were

so absurd. But there are many other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why I can neither believe the Monks my
self, nor think that they deserve Credit from
others. First, because our Laws do expresly
forbid Credit to be given to such Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
as may be begg'd; but only to Witnesses
who are upon Oath, as to the Truth of what
they say: For Monks, as I have often said,
being Strangers to the Affairs, and Publick

Evidence in a Publick Controversy, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Matter of Fact which hapned some Ages
before they were born: for if they were
brought to swear in Court, and the Judg
should enquire at them if they knew the
Parties against whom they are led as Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
they will say no. If they be ask'd, as
to the Matter it self, how they came to the
knowledg of those things which they swear,
what Cause, or, if not the true Cause, what
probable Cause at least can they bring, <hi>viz.</hi>
whether they saw those things, and were
present at the Transactions, they will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
no. If they be ask'd, how they come
to know it then, they will answer with
<hi>Malmsbury</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> that they had it
from credible Men. If the Judg urge them
further, and ask whether those credible Men
saw those things themselves, they will also
say, no; as they must of necessity do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
things transacted so many Years ago.
And if the Judg enquire further, how they
know that those Men deserved so much Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
they will answer, that they know it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Hearsay. But Witnesses who swear
only by Hearsay, and can give no probable
Reason, as we use to speak, for their Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
don't deserve Credit in any Court.
If they be interrogated concerning things

they should say that they have nothing for it
but idle Reports; and they would not have
committed things of that Importance to
Writing upon such slender Proofs, if they
had not been resolv'd to purchase the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Court, or the Applause of the
Vulgar, and to write for the Honour of
their Country at any rate: And shall those
Testimonies, or such as those, prejudg the

it to be branded with a Note of Servitude,
you your self bear them witness Mr. <hi>Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed;</hi>
and their being twice driven out of
<hi>Britain,</hi> because they would neither subject
themselves to the Britains nor the Romans,
does sufficiently instruct it; and the most
terrible Wars which they maintain'd against
<hi>Edward</hi> I, II, and III. upon this very account,
are sufficient to perswade any Man that reads
them of the Truth of it. For though the
Scots were overcome by <hi>Edward</hi> I. in three
or four fatal Battels, yet they could never
be brought to acknowledg this commentiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Homage, neither by Flattery nor Threats,

that Homage which his Grandfather
had extorted from <hi>Baliol.</hi> The Scots were
also overcome by <hi>Osbright</hi> and <hi>Ella,</hi> and by
the Danes, in two very great Battels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they lost two Kings; yet they never aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
the Cause, yielded up themselves, nor
perform'd Homage: Nay in this present
Age, we have been defeated in two bloody
Battels; in one of which we lost a most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
King, whose Heir was scarcely one year
old; and in the other, the Flower of our
Nobility: yet neither did we make a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of our selves, nor was Homage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of us. Is it so then Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi>
that we cannot be beat, but you will have us
to surrender upon it immediately? For as
often as the Rabble of English Historians
find it mentioned that the Scots were defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
then straight they will have them to be
subdu'd, reduc'd, ask Mercy, and yield up
the Kingdom; but as to the Victories of the
Scots, or how they delivered or recovered
their Country, there's always a profound
Silence. Or is it credible, that if the Scots
had been so defeated as to be out of all
hopes of restoring their Monarchy, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelstan</hi>

For when <hi>Ireland</hi> was conquered, their Kings
were commanded to lay aside the Royal
Title, as I have mentioned before, and so
became <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it lost the Name of Kingdom.
Then let <hi>Malmsbury</hi> say whatever comes

by his Brother <hi>Edmund.</hi> Which

if I tell them plainly, that I do not believe
them; for they deserve no more Credit
than they would give to the Writings of
our Monks concerning a Question which
might prejudg the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
I have been larger than was meet upon
this Affair, because our Neighbours have
no other English Saxon King whom they
can object to us, nor no other Victory over
us but that which he obtain'd. But what
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52199:130"/>

or render it up to hold in Vassalage, and

English Saxon Kings, and whether they
pretended any right to the Superiority of
Scotland.</head>
               <p>You subjoin, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphus</hi>
King of <hi>Scots,</hi> with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Men serv'd under <hi>Edmund</hi> Brother
and Successor to <hi>Athelstan,</hi> and did Homage
to him; and here you do manifestly
play the Sophister, as you have done all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.
<hi>Indulphus</hi> being only Heir apparent
to the Kingdom, and designed Prince of
<hi>Cumberland,</hi> did assist the King of <hi>England</hi>
wuth Forces, as he ought. But being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he never saw <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund:</hi>
Nor is there any mention of this
Homage in <hi>Malmsbury, Huntington, Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Westminster, Florence, Polydore, Stow,</hi>
nor in your own History, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> nor
any other English Writer that I know of.
We will grant you, that he brought ten
thousand Scots Auxiliaries to <hi>Edmund,</hi> who
would never have hazarded himself against
the Danes without them, but by their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
he did happily overcome them:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52199:131"/>
Nay, which is more, when <hi>Indulphus</hi> was
importun'd by the Danes, not to disturb them
in their Wars against the English, he refus'd,
and drew the Arms of the Danes from the
English upon himself; and having fought
and conquered them in a terrible bloody
Battel, he pursued a flying Brigade unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
and (as our Country-men have often
smarted for their too great Forwardness and
Heat) he was kill'd by a Body of the Danes,
which had never been broke. And for these
good Services we must be reckon'd to
have serv'd you as Vassals: whereas indeed
the English Kings who were sensible of our
Assistance, that they might repay the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
did permit the Scots to enjoy those
Northern Countries of <hi>Cumberland, West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland</hi>
and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> in Memory
of the Kindness received: but that they
did Homage for <hi>Scotland,</hi> there is not so
much as one of your own Monks who
hath left it in Writing.</p>
               <p>You and the Author of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of War, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> do both assert,
that <hi>Edred</hi> or <hi>Edred</hi> received Homage from
<hi>Irisius</hi> King of <hi>Scots;</hi> but that I may answer
both of you, there's no such Person as <hi>Irisius</hi>
to be found in the Catalogue of the Scotish
Kings: so that any Man may deservedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
this fictitious Homage with the fictitious
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52199:132"/>
King; nor does any Man besides your self
and this Forger, make mention of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage:
but that I may also deprive you of
your own Evidence, there's not only no
mention of this Homage in <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> and
the rest of the English Writers, nay, nor
even in your own History, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi>
which certainly you would never have
pass'd over, if you could have found any
Author for it, such is your Candor towards
us. This is wonderful Ignorance in those
Monks, that when they give Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our Kings, they don't so much as
know their Names; for most of them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Edward</hi> I. and <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. as we shall
see afterwards, write, that <hi>Irisius</hi> and <hi>Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldus</hi>
were Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
Homage to the Kings of <hi>England:</hi>
but if all the Catalogues of our Kings, and
all the publick Monuments be examin'd,
there are none to be found either by the
Name of <hi>Irisius</hi> or <hi>Reinaldus.</hi> Indeed they
shall be at liberty for us to feign what they
please concerning <hi>Irisius</hi> and <hi>Reinaldus,</hi> so
as they don't call them Kings of <hi>Scots,</hi> or
if they will have them to be such, that they
would say at what time, and how many
Years they reigned; where and to whom
this Homage was perform'd, and what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
they can produce for it. And as to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:52199:132"/>
what you say, that the Homage was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by the Barons of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
your ignorance of the Feudal Law;
for the Barons, as the greater Vassals, do
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> only to their own immediate Lord,
and he swears for them to the Liege
Lord.</p>
               <p>But you say, that <hi>Edgar</hi> Brother to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelstan,</hi>
did reign over all <hi>Britain.</hi> What
the Latins and your Writers understand by
the Name of <hi>Britain,</hi> hath been said else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where:
But you assert, that he received
Homage from <hi>Kennethus,</hi> for the Kingdom
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and appointed <hi>Malcolm</hi> to be
Prince thereof. You have indeed lost all
sense of Difference betwixt Truth and False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
but do still retain that betwixt Love
and Hatred: For <hi>Malcolm</hi> was born Heir
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and declared Prince of <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland.</hi>
You add, that <hi>Edgar</hi> did restore
<hi>Lothian</hi> to <hi>Kennethus,</hi> which <hi>Osbright</hi> had
taken away from him. But it appears both
by your own Writings, and ours, as I have
said before, that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> had
not only recovered those Provinces by
force of Arms Iong before this <hi>Kennethus,</hi>
but were also gifted with many Countries
by the English, for their faithful and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Service against the common Enemy the
Danes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:52199:133"/>It remains that we speak something of
the Homage. It is very probable, nor do
we deny it, that <hi>Malcolm</hi> Prince of <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
did perform Homage for his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality:
but <hi>Kennethus</hi> who was then King
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> never saw the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
or tell us we pray you, Mr. <hi>Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,</hi>
in what Year, and at what Place had
those Kings their Interview, or what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
have you for it. <hi>Polidore</hi> writes, that
<hi>Edgar</hi> did keep the Scots within Bounds;
and that uncertain Author, who continued
<hi>Bede</hi>'s History, says only, that <hi>Kennadus</hi>
K. of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Cumberland,</hi>
did bind themselves to <hi>Edgar</hi> by a perpetual
Oath <hi>(perpetuo Sacramento.)</hi> Many times those
who are not Subjects are thus obliged;
for Princes do usually ratify the Leagues
and Covenants betwixt themselves, with an
Oath, <hi>(Sacramento:)</hi> but as to the Homage,
there is no mention thereof in him, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other English Writer, although he calls
<hi>Edgar</hi> the Honour and Delight of <hi>England.</hi>
As to the Lodgings or House at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
in which the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> us'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this Homage: It is credible that the
King of <hi>England</hi> did not only furnish him
Lodgings there, but also bear the Expences
of his Journey, and that according to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.
For seeing the King of <hi>Scots</hi> did
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52199:133"/>
not think himself obliged in Law, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Homage any where, without the
Bounds of his own <hi>Fee,</hi> or if without his
<hi>Fee,</hi> that his Lord ought at least to bear his
Charges: It was agreed upon betwixt both
Kings, who did then live in the strictest
Bonds of Amity, that assoon as the King of
<hi>Scots</hi> should come over his own Borders,
he should be received by the Peers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
with one Bishop, and one Count, and
conducted to the King, at the publick
Charge: which we confess was first agreed
on by <hi>Edgar,</hi> as we shall afterwards explain
it in <hi>Richard</hi> I; and as it is prescrib'd by the
Feudal Law. And thus the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
being summoned by the French King,
was obliged to go. As for the <hi>Ius Custodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum,</hi>
which we call <hi>Wards,</hi> and that you
attribute to the Institution of <hi>Edgar,</hi> and
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er thence, that we were then his Subjects,
because we did afterwards embrace that
Law; the form of your Argument is both
disagreeable to the Rules of Disputation,
and it consists of a false Proposition. For the
Law concerning <hi>Wards,</hi> which you ascribe
to <hi>Edgar,</hi> is by our Writers ascribed to <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm</hi>
the second, who reign'd at the same
time: to which of them then do you say,
shall we give Credit? To ours certainly.
there being none of your Writers that I
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52199:134"/>
know of, who mention this, or any other
of <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Laws, but our <hi>Malcolm</hi>'s Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>

of English and Scots, <hi>William Terrem</hi>
a Norman, who it's suppos'd would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
any thing from the Off-spring of his
own Country, does attribute the same to us.
Neither is this true, that the said Law is only
observed amongst the English, for you had
it from the French, and especially the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
who retain it to this very Day. And

equal and just, that when the Vassal is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable

his Lord, that until such time as he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
the Lord receive the Fruits of his

own Service, and in the mean time take
care that his Vassal's Heir, who is also to be

Family which is at Enmity with his Own,
and be by that Means withdrawn from his

of <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> who were all of them as
it were condemned to row <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Galley,
while he sat on the Stern, is wholly ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.
Believe ye as the Lyrick Poet says,
<hi>Isti fubulae fore Librum persimilem cujus velut
aegri somnia vanae finguntur species.</hi> For
though those things be excerpted from that
Anonymous Author of the Continuation
of the English History and others; yet how
little Credit either you or they deserve will
easily appear: Where did you find those
call'd Kings of <hi>Cumberland, Galloway, Man,</hi>
or of our Isles? Who dignified them with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52199:135"/>
those Titles? When and from whom did
they receive the Royal Name? <hi>Cumberland</hi>
was at that time a Province, not very large,
and appointed for the Eldest Son of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
under the Name of a Principality;
but no Man did ever hear or write that it
was call'd a Kingdom, except some silly
Monks, who receive every little Whisper
and Rumor as Oracles. Nor is this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
numbred amongst those seven or eight
which were founded by the Saxons; and
besides these and the Scotish Kingdom, there
were no other than in <hi>Britain.</hi> I know
that <hi>Malmsbury</hi> calls them <hi>Reguli, Petty
Kings,</hi> whereas indeed they were only the
Princes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but always design'd by
a Royal Title, in the Writings of those ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and unexperienced Monks; and as
during <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Reign, there was no other
King of <hi>Cumberland</hi> than he who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
Successor to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
so <hi>Galloway</hi> is but a small part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that not very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
so that to imagine any King to have
reigned there at that time is wholly ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
there not being at this Day above
four or five in it, who are honoured with
so much as the Title of Barons. As to what
number of Kings did inhabit <hi>Westmoreland,</hi>
South <hi>Wales</hi> and North <hi>Wales,</hi> I don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52199:135"/>
my self; but this I know, that not one
of them was ever saluted by the Name of
King, or left on Record to Posterity under
that Title. I take no notice of your rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
the King of <hi>Scots</hi> amongst so many
other Petty Kings, whereas that tends as
much to your own disgrace as ours, seeing
you were never able to subdue that Prince,
how inconsiderable soever he was, by force
of Arms. But we will grant you that those
little Petty Sub-Kings were in a manner tied
to Chains, and expos'd to contempt, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as you will have it, led in triumph by
<hi>Edgar.</hi> Must those things which are done
by Princes, either for their Pleasure, or to
try their Strength or Skill in Rowing, be
drawn into Consequence? All the Kings
of <hi>England,</hi> as well before as since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and as they do at this very Day,
were accustomed to celebrate the Feast of
our Lord's Nativity with great Banquets,
and splendid Entertainment, and to invite
their Neighbouring Princes out of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and amongst the rest, all the Princes
of <hi>Wales,</hi> how many soever; and the King
of <hi>Scots</hi> who was also a Vassal to the King
of <hi>England,</hi> could not honestly refuse, but
upon what Conditions we have said alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and shall explain anon in <hi>Richard.</hi> This
Solemnity us'd to be continued to <hi>Epiphany,</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:52199:136"/>
till after which they did not use to dismiss
their Guests, and on the Eve before they
chose a King according to Custom whose
Commands all the rest were to obey du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Solemnity. The Lot fell upon
<hi>Edgar,</hi> so that he commanded the rest, and
they must of necessity obey; but shall we
draw an Argumen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> from this ludicrous Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival?
Certainly both the Assertion and
Proof of this Homage was very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
which was built upon no other
Foundation. What if this most Potent
Prince of yours had submitted himself to
some such pitiful Fellow as you use, for
Diversion's sake, to create King upon such
an Occasion, and had given him the right
Hand, allowed him the Regalia, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on him by Land or Water for a day or
two; would you therefore infer, that he
was subject to this pitiful Fellow? Neither
do you set down the Year that this Homage
was perform'd in: But how much more
wisely did <hi>Canute</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and
<hi>England</hi> behave himself, that when he was
saluted the most Potent Monarch on
Earth by his Flatterers, as he walk'd upon
the Shore of the Sea, he put off his Robe,
and sitting down on a Chair within the
Sea-mark, forbad the approaching Wave to
touch his Feet, but being wet by the same,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52199:136"/>
he is said to have turn'd him to his Parasites,
and spoke thus, <hi>Lo, he whom you salute as

But to return to your <hi>Edgar,</hi> that Saying of
his concerning so many Kings his Subjects,
was wholly barbarous, and an Evidence of
a Mind too much elevated, even above a
humane Lot, for which the English were
deservedly punish'd not long after, being
forc'd to redeem themselves, their Wives and
Children, and Liberties twice or thrice from
the Danes, and were at last despoil'd of the
Kingdom, and all their Military Glory, first
by the Danes, and then by the Normans.</p>
               <p>You will also have it, that <hi>Edgar</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
<hi>Kennadus</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> to a Duel,

in <hi>England,</hi> what wonder, especially with his

from our Historians: but that <hi>Edward</hi> made
War upon him on that account, is your

of this Subjection, just: but according to
our Historians, this <hi>Malcolm</hi> was very For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
and most Victorious, none of our

and turn'd the Arms of the <hi>Danes</hi> and
<hi>Norwegians</hi> from the English upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and having broke their Strength in
four or five great Battels, did at last drive
them wholly out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and obliged
them to an Agreement upon Oath never

a Condescension which they did never grant

glory in this, that for 200 Years together we
sustain'd the most violent Impressions of the
Danes and Norwegians, and forc'd them to
abandon their Design, though we were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd
by many of their Generals and Armies,
there being but a narrow Sea betwixt us.
Whereas you, though attack'd by a smaller

submitted to their Yoke for 27 or 28 Years:
Nor were you able to deliver your selves

<hi>Humber,</hi> with the Superiority of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
which <hi>Malcolm</hi> resisted according to
the usual Form, but at last perform'd Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
<hi>Canute</hi> held of <hi>K. Edmund</hi> as long as he liv'd;
and compell'd <hi>Malcolm</hi> to dedicate the
Church, lately mentioned, to <hi>Olaus</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
of the Norwegians: and so you make
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52199:139"/>
two superiour Lords of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and create
a double Superiority. For according to you
the King of <hi>Scots</hi> held <hi>Scotland</hi> of <hi>Canutus,</hi>
and he of <hi>Edmund;</hi> so that there is no end
of Lying when once a Man breaks over the
Boundaries of Modesty. It is no Marvel Mr.
<hi>Holinshed,</hi> that you are so ill seen in our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
you are so very ignorant of your own.
For what Author did ever write, that <hi>Canu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Edmund</hi> were reconcil'd by <hi>Emma?</hi>
Nay, is it not the height of Folly to commit
those things to Writing, that can be proven
to be false from other Writers? For <hi>Canutus</hi>
and <hi>Edmund,</hi> when they had fought together
in a Duel till they were both weary, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
themselves without <hi>Emma</hi>'s Privity.
Nor did <hi>Emma</hi> marry <hi>Canutus</hi> until <hi>Edmund</hi>
was dead: Neither was she Mother, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Step-mother to <hi>Edmund;</hi> so very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
are you in your own Mistory. But that
<hi>Canutus</hi> was invested with the Superiority
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> no Man besides your self did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
write; nor do I believe that it was ever
read before, that <hi>Malcolm</hi> did then swear Feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to him: No truly; and I am afraid that
you do rather want Honesty than Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;
and that you did not write those
things by Mistake, but because you had a
Mind to deceive others, or did at least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that none of our Country-men would
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:52199:140"/>
ever read those things; and therefore you
thought your self at liberty to blab and
prate what you pleas'd. That little Church
dedicated to <hi>Olaus,</hi> might perhaps have been
some Argument if the Norwegians should
require Homage, though that would not be
sufficient neither; but how it can be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the English Homage, I don't see,
If it had been a Trophy of any English
Victory erected at the Appointment of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelfred</hi>
or <hi>Edmund,</hi> it had never been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
to St. <hi>Olaus,</hi> the tutelary Saint of
the Norwegians; but to St. <hi>George,</hi> the
Guardian of <hi>England,</hi> seeing there were at
that time most cruel and bloody Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the English and the Norwegians. But
all this, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> you have from our
History, which you do miserably pervert.
And if it were as you say, with what Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
can the English redemand this Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
of <hi>Scotland</hi> from <hi>Canute</hi>'s Successors,
the Kings of <hi>Denmark?</hi> for neither can the
King of <hi>England</hi> own himself to be <hi>Canutus</hi>
his Heir, nor seek that again which he hath
gifted to another.</p>
               <p>And because we are fallen upon <hi>Canutus,</hi>
whom <hi>Holinshed,</hi> both in this little Treatise,
and in his History, entitles King of <hi>England,
Denmark, Norway, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Sweden;</hi>
and says that he demanded Homage from
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52199:140"/>
                  <hi>Malcolm,</hi> who only resisted him for fashion's
sake: It remains to be enquired, whether
those things agree with the Truth of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.
And first, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> you alledg in
your History that <hi>Canute</hi> went into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and did not only overcome King <hi>Malcolm</hi>
in that one Expedition, but also two other
Scotish Kings, <hi>Macbeth</hi> and <hi>Ieohmar,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much Trouble, and forc'd them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
themselves his Subjects.</p>
               <p>That there were three Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi>
at that time when <hi>Canute</hi> undertook the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
is not very probable; their Names
not being in the Catalogue of our Kings, nor
never so much as heard of by us. <hi>Matthew</hi> of
<hi>Westminster</hi> does advisedly forbear Names;
and I should have look'd upon it as a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pographical
Error, had I not found the very
same Names in <hi>Huntington,</hi> and also in <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docus,</hi>
a Welch Historian, who was certainly
led into that Mistake by the English Monks.
And they do all of them take notice, that
this was done after the Return of <hi>Canute</hi>
from <hi>Rome,</hi> but say nothing of the Causes of
this War, which they call only Rebellion;
neither do they make any mention of the
Year, with what Forces, under what Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
or in what Place the Battels were fought.
Must we then believe such unlearned and
ignorant Monks, who did not know the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52199:141"/>
Names of the Kings that perform'd the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and against whom they gave their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and who confess they knew not
the Cause of the Transaction? But that Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will not be able to stand before the
more weighty Evidence of greater Men,
nay even of <hi>Canute</hi> himself: For <hi>Polydore</hi> says
that he went to <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year 1030. that
on his Return, he took Arms against <hi>Richard</hi>
Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> for having divorced his
Sis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er <hi>Histritha,</hi> and died in <hi>Normandy</hi> soon
after his Landing. This Author does not
only pass over all his Expedition into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as a thing that never had a being, but
also asserts that immediately af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er his Return
from <hi>Rome,</hi> he made War upon <hi>Richard</hi> D.
of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and died in the Expedition,
But those good Historians ascribe that Time
after his Return, to his subduing of <hi>Scotland;</hi>
which they give out he did without much
trouble. <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester, Hoveden,</hi> the
Continuator of <hi>Bede, Ethelverd</hi> nor <hi>Ingulpb,</hi>
have nothing of this Expedition of <hi>Canute</hi>
against the Scots; and would never certainly
have omitted a thing so considerable, if it
had been true. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut what farther Inference
can be drawn from those things, supposing
them to be true, as they are notoriously
false, but only that Homage was perform'd;
which perhaps we may grant them, as being
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52199:141"/>
equal that he who was Vassal for <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

               <p>But they say that <hi>Canute</hi> was a King of

he stiles himself only King of <hi>Denmark,
England, Norway,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi>
and certainly if he had been King of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> he would never have pass'd that
over in silence, when he takes notice of
his being King of <hi>Norway</hi> and a great part
of <hi>Sweden:</hi> Were we unworthy to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
amongst his Conquests? don't we read
that <hi>Gethus</hi> King of <hi>Orkney</hi> afforded Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Triumph to <hi>Claudius?</hi> I cannot then
imagine any other reason why he should
not have taken notice of us amongst his
Titles; and therefore it must of necessity
follow, that either <hi>Canute</hi> or <hi>Holinshed,</hi> with
his <hi>Malmsbury</hi> and <hi>Huntington,</hi> have forgot
themselves; it is not usual with Kings to
omit any of their Titles, nor would he have
pass'd over <hi>Scotland,</hi> who set down a great
part of <hi>Sweden. Canute</hi> on his return from

writ to the Archbishops of <hi>England,</hi> and

others of both Orders, Ecclesiasticks as well
as Laicks. And it is to be seen in <hi>Florence</hi>
abovementioned, when he divided his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
amongst his Children a little before
his Death, that he calls himself King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Denmark, Norway</hi> and a great part
of <hi>Sweden,</hi> but there's no mention of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
neither in <hi>Florence</hi> nor <hi>Krantzius:</hi>
and this Letter is to be found both in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>

<hi>Holinshed</hi> writes, that <hi>Scotland</hi> was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued

the Mouths of those ignorant Monks, (to
say no worse of them) who do write so
often that the <hi>Scots</hi> rebell'd, were routed,
conquer'd and subdued, I shall exhibite
here one Testimony of King <hi>Edward,</hi> who
succeeded <hi>Canute,</hi> which will overturn all
those Calumnies. For when it was debated
in the publick Meeting of the States or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<hi>Who ought to be accounted as Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons
of</hi> England, <hi>and enjoy the same Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
with them: Those of</hi> Britany <hi>in</hi> France
<hi>were nam'd, first, because they were originally
from</hi> England, <hi>Edward added the Welch
next, because King Inas married a Wife out
of Wales, and at that time there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Intermarriage betwixt the Welch and the
English. The Scots were mentioned in the
third Place, who almost all of them, especially
the Nobility, had married with the English, and
so at that time two became one Flesh throughout
all Britain, by which they became one Nation,
and one People through the whole Island. All
those abovementioned (says he) did ever stand
stoutly as one Man, for the common Vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Crown and Kingdom against the</hi>
Danes <hi>and</hi> Norwegians, <hi>fought it most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
and unanimously against the Common
Enemy, and bore the Burden of most fierce
Wars in the Kingdom.</hi> This I have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
verbatim, lest any one should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52199:143"/>
me of adding somewhat of my own.
<hi>This Law of</hi> Edward, William the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<hi>con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irm'd in the publick Meeting of the
States</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miâ.</note>, as they are translated from the
Saxon Tongue by <hi>William Lambard,</hi> in the
Edition printed at <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Iohn Day</hi> in
1568, and indeed there are many things
in this Law worth the taking notice of.
The first thing to be weighed, is the Title
which is concerning those who may and
ought of Right to cohabit and remain in
the Kingdom of <hi>Britain.</hi> Secondly, It is
expresly provided, that the Scots may and
ought of Right to cohabit and remain in the
Kingdom of <hi>Britain</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> that is,
be accounted Denizons, and enjoy the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of the Kingdom. There's a two-fold
Reason given in the Text, why they
ought to be reckon'd amongst the Denizons
of <hi>England; First, Because the Nobility of</hi>
Scotland, <hi>and almost all the People in general
had married with the English, as many of the
English had married with the Scots; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Scots being descended of English Blood,
they were of Right to be accounted as English.
The second Reason is, because all the People
beforementioned did ever stand stoutly as one
Man, for the common Vtility of the Crown
and Kingdom against the</hi> Danes <hi>and Norwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,
and fought it most valiantly and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52199:143"/>
against the common Enemy, and bore
the Burden of most fierce Wars in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
The doubling of the Adverb</hi> Semper <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be taken notice of, and that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ag'd
most fierce Wars together, for the profit of the
Kingdom of</hi> England. Moreover, the Time
when they became one People, and did
unanimously sustain the Impression of the
Common Enemies, is dated from the Reign
of <hi>Inas</hi> King of the English or West Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who came to the Crown in 689, and
continued till his time. This one Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of King <hi>Edward</hi> I oppose to those of
all the English Historians, who write, that
the King of <hi>Scots</hi> did so often rebel, and
conspire against the English, with the <hi>Danes</hi>
and <hi>Norvegians,</hi> was so often conquered,
surrendred, and forc'd to become a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant:
for this <hi>Edward</hi> was elder than any
Historian now extant in <hi>England,</hi> nor have
they any Historian from the Death of <hi>Bede</hi>
to this <hi>Edward</hi> before the Conquest;
who was a prudent Man, and a very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Evidence of the things that were
done before. Moreover, this Law was
approv'd by all the States of <hi>England,</hi> who
it's reasonable to suppose understood more
of the Transactions which happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their time, than any Monk of the next
two following Ages; and therefore by the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52199:144"/>
Testimonies of King <hi>Edward,</hi> that of all
the States of <hi>England,</hi> and the Conqueror
himself: the Scots during the time of the
Saxon Monarchy, were their fellow Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and faithful Companions, had the same
Friends and Enemies in common, and fought
manfully for their Safety against the <hi>Danes</hi>
and <hi>Norwegians,</hi> and did thereby deserve to
enjoy the same Privileges with the English.
These things I have insisted upon to refute
their Calumnies, who alledg, <hi>that the King
of Scots ought to be excluded from the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>as a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You say that <hi>Edward,</hi> younger Brother
to this <hi>Edmund,</hi> did deprive <hi>Malcolm</hi> King
of <hi>Scots</hi> of his Life and Kingdom, and made
his Son <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and
<hi>Northumberland.</hi> That any of the <hi>Malcolms</hi>
were ever slain by the English, was never
so much as heard of among us; and I
should suppose that this Trifler means <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
but that he himself takes notice that
<hi>Mackbeth</hi> was slain afterward, being afraid
belike that he should omit any thing, and
therefore would be sure to write the same
thing twice. This <hi>Mackbeth</hi> was slain in
Battel by <hi>Malcolm</hi> Prince of <hi>Cumberland,</hi>
and true Heir to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
but driven thence by the Tyranny of <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:52199:144"/>
We confess that in his Army, there
was not only a great part of the Scotish
Nobility but most of the Northumbrians
under their Earl <hi>Sivard, Malcolm</hi>'s Uncle,
who join'd his Nephew with his Forces, as
the Obligation of Kindred requir'd he
should, and afterwards that same <hi>Sivard</hi> did
appear in Battel against the Conqueror up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Malcolm</hi>'s account, as we shall see anon.
But otherwise there's no mention of <hi>Edward</hi>
in our Historians, except that those Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries
are suppos'd to have been sent to
<hi>Malcolm,</hi> rather by his Connivance than
Consent.</p>
               <p>The Law concerning the Marriage of an
Heir, or Ward of Marriage, (<hi>Maritatione
haeredis</hi>) comes from the Feudal Law, and
was in use both amongst the Normans and
us, before the English had any thing of it.
But this is to be observed, that <hi>Cumberland</hi>
and <hi>Northumberland</hi> were possess'd by the
Scots, not under the Title of a Kingdom
but of a Principality. But our Author is
so much mistaken, and so very ignorant in
History, that he makes three Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
<hi>Malcolm</hi>'s, one slain by <hi>Edward,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who was Prince of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and
substituted in his room by <hi>Edward,</hi> and the
third <hi>Malcolm</hi> Son to <hi>Duncan,</hi> who being
driven from the Throne by <hi>Malcolm</hi> fled
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52199:145"/>
into <hi>England</hi> for his Life. Nor is that <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm</hi>
Son to <hi>Duncan</hi> any other than that same
<hi>Malcolm</hi> Son to the King of <hi>Cumberland,</hi>
who if he did Homage to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for his Possessions which he held in
<hi>England,</hi> what wonder, or where is there
any thing strange in it? but that he did Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or was
delivered to <hi>Edward</hi> by the Nobility of
<hi>Scotland</hi> upon the Account of Wardship, is
foolish to assert: For having fled from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
because of <hi>Mackbeth</hi>'s Tyranny, he
lurk'd for some time in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Henry</hi>
the <hi>2d</hi> did afterwards with <hi>David</hi> King of
<hi>Scotland:</hi> but that <hi>Edward</hi> gave him <hi>`Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi>
to Wife is still more absurd, for this
Marriage was not consummated till after
<hi>Edward</hi>'s Death, which was some Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and during the Conqueror's Reign;
for <hi>Malcolm</hi> having entertain'd <hi>Edgar Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
the true Heir to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>
with <hi>Margaret</hi> his Sister who had fled from
thence, being taken with <hi>Margaret</hi>'s Beauty
and Disposition, he married her, whence
there did arise an occasion of War betwixt
him and the Conqueror. Don't you see,
Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> how you are catch'd every
way in this Fiction, and encumbred on all
Hands, and that you don't distinguish those
Times aright? This <hi>Malcolm</hi> whom you
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52199:145"/>
call Son to the King of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

was true Heir to the Crown of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and Son to <hi>Duncan,</hi> declared
Prince of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> while his Father was
alive and ow'd Homage upon that account,
and therefore it's no wonder that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
the same.</p>
               <p>Writers say, that <hi>Sivard</hi> march'd into
<hi>Scotland</hi> to assist <hi>Malcolm,</hi> and it may be
that it was by <hi>Edward</hi>'s Command, which
was no more than what became a lover of
Equity, to join his Forces with those of
<hi>Malcolm,</hi> who was his Vassal for <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and was then pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
his Right to the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi>
by Force of Arms; and in that Battel <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
who seiz'd upon the Crown by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
was kill'd by <hi>Macduff</hi> Earl of <hi>Fife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a bloody Battel betwixt <hi>Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y</hi>
Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th;</hi>
the Earl was assisted by a great number
of <hi>Scots,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Dougl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And if <hi>Henry</hi> had fall'n in that Battel, as he
was likely to have done, we could not have
said that he was kill'd by <hi>Douglas</hi> or the
Scots: Nor for the same reason can we say,
that <hi>Mackbeth</hi> was slain by <hi>Sivard,</hi> but by
<hi>Malcolm</hi> the General of the whole Army, at
that time Prince of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and in a
little while after King of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

of their Kingdoms from him, and paying
him Homage, being deceived by a corrupt

pretend the same, and make use of the like
deceitful Argument, that the <hi>Britains</hi> being

them; and upon that Account they claim
the Right of Homage from the Scots: Tho
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52199:147"/>
with the Englishmens leave, I make bold to
say, that the great Turk's Argument is much
the Stronger and more Honest: for he seiz'd
the Capital of the Christian Empire; and
sometimes there is, as there is said to be, a Right
in Arms: But in the Seizure of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the <hi>Britains,</hi> there were many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things that did concur, which I should
rather were objected by the <hi>Britains,</hi> than
our Country-men. Therefore if they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
acquir'd this Right by the Concession
of the <hi>Britains,</hi> nor by a lawful Succession
in their Room; it follows of Course, that
they must have acquir'd it since their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
in <hi>Britain:</hi> and though it be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
repugnant to the Nature of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Royal Majesty to acknowledg a
Liege Lord, yet if there be any such thing
amongst Kings, as an acknowledgment of a
Superior, as wicked Ambition introduces
new forms every Day; it has only Place in
such Kingdoms as are lately constituted and
erected into the Form of Kingdoms on the
Condition, that they should acknowledg a
Superior, such as are the Kingdoms of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,
Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> The first of which
was honoured with the Title of Kingdom
by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> though others say, that
it was by <hi>Frederick Barbarossa</hi> or <hi>Aenobarba,</hi>
meerly from a <hi>Caesar</hi>-like Ambition, as I

yield in any thing to the Imperial Dignity,
but would rival them in Power. But those
Kingdoms were erected at first on this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that they should be Feudatory, and
were honoured with that Title on purpose,
that they should acknowledg a Superior;
but this could not have Place in Antient
Kingdoms which were originally Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant:
for no Man in his right Wits, who
was originally Free, will easily condescend
to be rendred subject to the Power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
seeing upon any Offence against his
Liege Lord, he is immediately depriv'd of
his Fee; but that the Scotish Monarchy is
older than that of the English Saxons, is not
denied by <hi>Holinshed</hi> himself, who writes,
that so many Scotish Kings were subdued by
<hi>Sicilius</hi> King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
did also wrest the Soveraignty of all
<hi>Britain</hi> from the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> so that
they must of necessity have been before the
Saxons, or as we have already demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
elder also than the British Monarchy;
for we have plainly prov'd, that the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
had no Kings before the Irruptions of
the Scots, but were subject to a Roman Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52199:148"/>
If then the Scots were independant
from the very first Constitution of their
Kingdom, How could it be that they should
enslave themselves to the Will of another,
and acknowledg Foreign Lords? They
must either have done this of their own
Accord or by Force; as to their having done
it spontaneously, <hi>Holinshed</hi> himself will bear
them witness how ill they take it, and that
they cannot bear it with Patience to have
this Homage mentioned to them at this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Day; and we shall make it appear fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
anon, when we come to speak of <hi>Henry</hi>
the third, and <hi>Edward</hi> the first, Kings of
<hi>England.</hi> But when we were invited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by their Bounty (<hi>Beneficio</hi>), we did
willingly acknowledg the King of <hi>England</hi>
as our Superior; and in truth according to
the Feudal Law, there's no better way of
constituting or confirming a Fee than Bounty
(<hi>Beneficium</hi>): Neither were ever the Kings
of <hi>Scotland</hi> Beneficiaries to those of <hi>England</hi>
for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor does any
Body write that they were; for seeing we
do far exceed the English in Antiquity, it
cannot be suppos'd that we obtain'd that as
their Bounty, which we enjoyed long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Monarchy, and are still in Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of to this very Day. If they say that
we swore Fealty for <hi>Cumberland, Westmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:52199:148"/>
and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> which are great
Countries, then they say something that has
a Semblance of Truth: for as long as we
were permitted to enjoy that Bounty, we
acknowledged the King of <hi>England</hi> as our
Liege-Lord, and did him faithful and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Service in all his Expeditions against the
Danes, as <hi>Holinshed</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> himself, the
last of the Saxon Kings, have left in writing;
and I do very much doubt that they would
ever have been able to shake off the Danish
Yoke, without the Assistance of the Scotish
Arms: But when they redemanded the
<hi>Bounty,</hi> which they had granted us freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and do now retain it by Violence, by
what Law can they require Homage and
Fealty upon that account, seeing they have
recall'd the <hi>Benefit</hi> for which it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd?</p>
               <p>The second Part remains still, which is,
that being conquered by their Arms, we
were forc'd to acknowledg the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
as our Superiour. It is true indeed,
that Nations overcome by War, do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
acknowledg the conqueror for their
Liege-Lord: but this I do constantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that no Nation subdued by War, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
yet their own King left, do so much
fall under the Power of the Conqueror, as
to acknowledg him and their own King for
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52199:149"/>
Liege-Lord at the same time. If otherwise, I
wish they would produce an Example that
ever a King overcome by War, and left in
his own Country with all his Rights and
Privileges, swore F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'d to be suppress'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Royal Title, and not left to
renew the War upon every occasion. Did
the English when they subdued <hi>Ireland,</hi> leave
the Irish their Kings, of whom they had at
that time five or six? No surely, but that
all occasion of Rebellion might be cut off,
they abolish'd the Name of Kings, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
Fiduciary Earls. But of a King o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
in War, and left in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
as a Fiduciary, no Man hath ever hith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
read or heard.</p>
               <p>It remains now that we enquire into the
Matter of Fact, whether or not it be likely
that the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> being overcome by
the Saxon Arms, was compelld to swear
Fealty to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
him as his Liege-Lord. Certainly from
their Arrival with <hi>Hengist,</hi> to the time of the
Conquest, they had war with the Britains
for 400 Years; and the Britains being wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with many Overthrows, did very much
consume the Strength of the Saxons. Nor
did the Britains lay aside the Royal Dignity
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52199:149"/>
until <hi>William Rufus,</hi> the Conqueror's Son,
overcame them in 1193, and kill'd their King
<hi>Rhaesus:</hi> Therefore it is probable, that they
neither thought of subduing <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor
were in a Capacity to do it during that
Time.</p>
               <p>While the British Monarchy was still in
being, the Saxons rag'd against one another
with mutual Slaughters, until the rest of the
Saxon Kings being conquered, the King of
the West Saxons obtain'd the Soveraignty of
all <hi>England</hi> except <hi>Wales,</hi> which hapned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Year 833; and therefore it is not
likely that they were intent upon the swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
up of other Kingdoms during that
time. And before that, the Danes did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
Piracy upon the Maritime Counties;
and being invited by the Fruitfulness of the
Island, and other things, and following the
same Methods that the Saxons had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, they conceived hopes of seizing
the Kingdom: and therefore the English,
though they did willingly unite in one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
they did also desire the Conjunction of
the Scots, that they might be the more able
to resist the Common Enemy. The Scots
did readily consent, and especially for these
two Reasons: First, because the English had
a little before that embrac'd the Christian
Religion, to which the Danes were capital
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52199:150"/>
Enemies, as I said before: And, Secondly,
because they had experienc'd the Valour of
the Danes when they slew <hi>Constantine</hi> the
King of <hi>Scots</hi> and his Army; and perceiving
that they should be liable to the same dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
if the Danes should rout the English,
and seize the Kingdom, they did willingly
associate their Arms with the English: And
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lured</hi> himself being assisted by the Scots
Auxiliaries, did break the Strength of the
Danes, (Who had already seized a great part
of <hi>England</hi>) and entertain'd a sacred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
Friendship with the Scots, having
left them those Northern Provinces of <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,
Westmoreland,</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
as a Reward of their Social Arms against the
Danes: And his Successor <hi>Edward</hi> did the
same. As for those Victories which they boast
of having obtain'd; that was indeed a great
one which <hi>Osbright</hi> and <hi>Ella,</hi> being conjoin'd
with the Britains, did gain over the Scots,
and I know not if ever they had a greater
afterward: and though by that Victory the
Scots lost all the countries be-South the
<hi>Forth,</hi> yet the English themselves did never
pretend that they demanded Homage or
Fealty from them. Nay, that <hi>Holinshed's</hi>
Temper may be known to all Men, he has
not this Story of <hi>Osbright</hi> and <hi>Ella</hi> from any
English Writer; but hath excerpted it from
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52199:150"/>
ours, that he might scrape together on every
side whatever could be injurious to our
Fame; so as having thrown off all Modesty,
he may affirm that the Scots made a Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of themselves, and performed Homage,
though the same was never mentioned nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by any of ours, nor the English Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Holinshed</hi> himself is Author
of this Forgery, amongst many others. From
his time till that of <hi>Edward</hi> the Martyr, or
<hi>Athelstan,</hi> there was no War betwixt the
English and Scots; and it's certain, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that Time they obtain'd no Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us: for the English Historians would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have pass'd it over, seeing they take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of things far less considerable and stuff
their Writings with meer Trifles and Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives
Fables: And the English Saxons ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
against one another with mutual But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries
all that time, and being quickly after
attack'd by the Danes, it's very improbable
that they did ever so much as think of inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Scotland,</hi> or demanding Homage from
the Scots; and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter that the Heptarchy was
united into one Kingdom, and that the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were overwhelmed with the Danish
War, they associated with the Scots, and
delivered them the Northern Counties of
<hi>Cumberland, Westmoreland</hi> and <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:52199:151"/>
as aforesaid. But <hi>Athelstan</hi> having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
some Respite from the Danish War,
and not being able to bear so great a Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of his Kingdom, repenting him of his
Gift, he sought back those Countries, forc'd
the offended Scots to associate with the
Danes for maintaining their own Right, and
revenge themselves for <hi>Edward</hi>'s Violation
of his Faith. However, the Scots were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
<hi>Malcolm</hi> being their General, though
the English do falsly assert that it was <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine.</hi>
But after that Peace was renewed,
and <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmoreland</hi> delivered
as a <hi>Benefit</hi> to the Prince of Scots; it is plain
from the Histories, that the English did never
obtain any great Victory over the Scots till
<hi>Edward</hi> the Firsts time.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns the English Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of those Times, except it be <hi>Bede</hi> and
<hi>Gildas,</hi> whose Testimonies I have faithfully
cited already, we have none who take any
notice of this Homage; all the rest being la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by many Ages, as I noted before;
and confess themselves, that they have no
Historian whom they can follow. But this is
the common Fault of all Historians to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
in the Praises of their own Country, and
allow themselves a Liberty of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

does not meet with Stories of their having
conquered and subdued <hi>Denmark, Germany</hi>
and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> a great many times; and
extolling the Valour of the Poles to the
Skies, nay above them? And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

in their Histories of <hi>Denmark, Germany</hi> and
<hi>Sweden.</hi> Though they have that indeed
whereof they may deservedly glory; but
however, they mix true things with false, so
that the Truth it self comes often to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in question. And so the English relate
their Victories over the Scots, as Cowards,
Rebel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Covenant-breakers, and not so much
as worthy to be conquered: But of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
gain'd over them by the Scots, which
must of necessity have been some, otherwise
they had never been able to have held their
Kingdom, how inconsiderable soever it is,
there's a profound Silence. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
I am the more favourable to <hi>Ieffrey</hi>
of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> for I perceive his Fault to be
common to all Historians; and therefore
honest Men do seldom give Credit to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
of one Nation who write against

at Enmity. But <hi>Holinshed,</hi> with his <hi>Leland</hi>

neither without a Falsification? for he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
that to <hi>Marianus,</hi> which is no where

Testimonies of Monks deserve, who were
not present at the Transactions themselves,
but us'd to entertain vulgar Fame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reports for Truth, especially seeing the
English are generally more addicted to their
own Praise than is just, I leave to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Reader; <hi>Holinshed</hi> himself being
also suspicious of the Veracity of the Monks
in more places than one.</p>
               <p>The Question of Right, which I referred
to the End of this Chapter, doth still remain:
<hi>Whether or not this</hi> Constantine <hi>or</hi> Malcolm
<hi>could render the Kingdom subject, or oblige it to
pay Homage to another,</hi> seeing they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
it free from their Ancestors? For it is
certain that no Man can alienate the Rights
of Majesty deriv'd from his Fore-fathers, or
make himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> feudatory to another Prince;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52199:152"/>
and that neither <hi>Constantine</hi> nor <hi>Malcol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
nor any of those who succeeded them, could
invest another with the Rights of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which came free to their hands, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the same to hold in Fee of another. For
Kings being appointed by God to represent
his Image upon the Earth, they can have no
other Superior besides himself; and that the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> was free and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
before the Reigns of <hi>Constantine</hi> and
<hi>Malcolm</hi> our Adversaries themselves cannot
deny. And in this Question all true hearted
English-men will agree with me, they being
no less concern'd in this Case than we; for
their Kings have often yielded themselves up
to the power of others. <hi>Offa,</hi> King of the
<hi>Mercians,</hi> or <hi>South-Saxons,</hi> having made a
Journey to <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> did render his People tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary
to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair; which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
by <hi>Ethelwolph,</hi> who did reign almost
over all <hi>England:</hi> And so under King <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi>
the <hi>English</hi> were made tributary to the
Danes, and forc'd to redeem their Liberty
with Money. But <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> did
so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar subject his Kingdom to the Pope, that
his Successors were not to receive the Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiture
thereof from any other but the Pope;
and therefore seeing this sort of Subjection
doth also militate against their own Liberty,
they will not take it ill if I expatiate a little
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52199:153"/>
in this field. What <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi>
thought as to this Question, I shall subjoin in
<hi>Holinshed</hi>'s own words: John <hi>could not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the Kingdom to the Pope without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Peers; and therefore he forfeited the
Crown by his own Fault, because the Kingdom
of</hi> England <hi>never did nor never shall appertain
to the Patrimony of St.</hi> Peter: <hi>For tho' King</hi>
John <hi>was a lawful King, neither he nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King could alienate the Kingdom without
consent of the `Peers, who are oblig'd to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of him and his Royal Prerogative as much
as in them lies. And if the Pope</hi> (continues
he) <hi>intends to defend this Error, it will be a
dangerous Example to all the Kingdoms of the
World. Those things being said, the Peers of</hi>
France <hi>who were present, did unanimously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
that they would persist in the defence of this
until death; that no Prince nor King could a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his own Pleasure alienate the Kingdom, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it tributary to any other King or Prince, so
as the Peers may be compell'd to do Homage to
any foreign Prince.</hi> For he loses the Rights of
Majesty, and cannot be any more call'd a
King, who is subject to the Power and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of another, seeing he was formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour

it might be that he who held them in

therefore our Task here is so much the more

to bring from English Monuments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
Records, and the Evidence of the Witnesses
produced against us: And yet from those
we shall make it plainly appear, if I be not
mightily mistaken, that the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was always free, and did never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
any Superiour Lord, (which is more
than the English can say for themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
But if our Kings receiv'd any thing from
theirs under the Notion of a <hi>Benefit,</hi> or
<hi>Bounty, (Beneficii)</hi> it's not to be recokon'd
strange that they should have perform'd Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
for that, seeing the Benefit cannot be
retain'd without the Homage, the one going
always along with the other. But if the Lord
either by Injustice, or due Course of Law,
recal his Bounty, it were very uncivil in him
when he takes that away, still to require Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
or Homage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:52199:155"/>But before we come to those things which
are objected against us by <hi>Holinshed</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
we must enquire in general, that if
there was any Homage due from <hi>Scotland</hi>
to the King of <hi>England,</hi> to whom it ought
to accrue after the Conquest, whether to
the true Heirs of their former Lord, or to
those who succeeded him by Force and
Arms; for the English themselves will not
say, that Force and Arms do either give or
take away another Man's Right, in as much
as they do still entitle themselves Kings of
<hi>France,</hi> though they were thrown out
thence by Force of Arms. The same is to
be said as to the King of <hi>France,</hi> who does
to this day call himself King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> as
believing the same to pertain to him by
Hereditary Right. Then seeing Right can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be purchas'd by Force and Arms, nor
Prescription be pleaded against him who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
act, but that by Laws both Humane and
Divine, every one's Right ought to remain
entire to him; we must find out who it is
that succeeded to that Right by Law.</p>
               <p>There are some who feign, that <hi>William
the Conqueror</hi> was nam'd by <hi>Edward the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor</hi>
for his Successor, and that he left the
Kingdom to him by his Will; and <hi>Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</hi>
who is asham'd of nothing, how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
soever, will have it, that he succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52199:156"/>
as next of Kin: but how or by what means
that can be, and how agreeable it is to the
Laws of God and Man, I shall show in a
few words. And first, that it may be
known who this <hi>Edward</hi> was, and by what
Right he succeeded to the Kingdom, the
Line of Succession must be repeated from
<hi>Egilfred</hi> or <hi>Ethelfred</hi> the undoubted King of
<hi>England. Ethelfred</hi> then had two Sons, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>
the Eldest call'd <hi>Ironside,</hi> (because of
his great Strength) by <hi>Ethelgin</hi> his Wife, and
<hi>Edward the Confessor</hi> by <hi>Emma</hi> Sister to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
the second, Duke of <hi>Normandy. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>
succeeded his Father, and had a Son,
who because of his Banishment was named
<hi>Edward the Exile;</hi> for <hi>Canute</hi> succeeding
<hi>Edmund</hi> (justly or unjustly I shall not say)
lest he should incur any Damage from the
Children of an excellent Father, whose Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
was precious to the English, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
<hi>Edward</hi> who was therefore sirnamed
<hi>the Exile.</hi> This <hi>Edward</hi> retiring to the
Court of <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperor, found so much
Favour there, that he obtain'd for Wife
<hi>Agatha</hi> Sister to the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and
Niece to the said Emperor, by whom he
had <hi>Edgar</hi> commonly called <hi>Etheling,</hi> and
<hi>Margaret</hi> afterwards Queen of <hi>Scots. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute</hi>
and his Son <hi>Hardicanute</hi> Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
being dead, <hi>Edward,</hi> who was Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:52199:156"/>
to <hi>Edmund,</hi> only by the Father's Side,
whether it was by the Craft of his Mother
<hi>Emma,</hi> or by Election, as the English will
have it, usurp'd the Crown, by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the <hi>Normans;</hi> against the Laws
of <hi>England,</hi> seeing he was not of the full
Blood; but living a long time without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and having no hopes of Issue, he
sent into <hi>Germany</hi> to recal <hi>Edward,</hi> Son to
his Brother <hi>Edmund,</hi> from his Exile, that
he might appoint him to be Heir of the
Crown, in a Convention of the Nobility.
<hi>Edward</hi> obeyed, and return'd into <hi>England,</hi>
but died that same Year. King <hi>Edward</hi>
griev'd at it, as it was but just, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
his Son <hi>Edgar</hi> to the Nobles, as
Heir of the Crown; and for that Cause
would have him called <hi>Etheling,</hi> which is as
much as Infant of the Kingdom, according
to the Custom of <hi>Spain.</hi> But let the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
say and write what they please con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this <hi>Edward,</hi> and rank him amongst
the Gods if they will admit him, to me he
seems not to have been a good Man, who
took the Kingdom that was his Nephew's to
himself, neither could he be call'd the true
King of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore it's very
unlike that he would appoint the Norman
Heir to the Crown by his Will: for besides
that it is most certain, and according to the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52199:157"/>
Opinion of all Lawyers, <hi>That Kingdoms
cannot be disposed of by Will;</hi> it is as certain,
that the Father cannot prefer the Second to
the First-Born, or invert the Law of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
in his Kingdom. Neither is this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to Equity, of which this King is
given out by his Countrymen to have been
a strict Observer: For it is not probable
that either living or dying he would be of
the Mind to transfer the Crown into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Family when he had a just Heir, and
the Dreams which he is said by <hi>Holinshed</hi>
himself to have had before his Death, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that he had never conceived any such
Design. His last words are to be found in
<hi>Cambde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> by which it plainly appears, that
he appointed no Man Heir to the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> by his Will: So that the true
Successor to that Kingdom, after the Death
of this <hi>Edward the Confessor,</hi> was <hi>Edgar E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theling;</hi>
and this Homage was due to him
and his Heirs, and he dying without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the Right of Succession devolv'd on
the Heirs of <hi>Margaret,</hi> that is, the Kings of
<hi>Scotland: And the Superiority, if there was any
such, is consolidate and confounded with the
Property,</hi> as Lawyers speak. For <hi>Malmsbury</hi>
and <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> do ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<hi>That the whole Nobility of the Kingdom
of</hi> England <hi>went to the Scots,</hi> and the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52199:157"/>
of the Crown devolv'd upon the
Sons of <hi>Margaret</hi> after the Conquest; but
the English Nobles, because this <hi>Edgar</hi> was
not fit to govern, suffered <hi>Edward</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the Crown of his Forefathers: But
while they reject the true Heir, they are
forc'd to acknowledg a Foreigner for their
Soveraign, by whom being dispoil'd of their
Riches and Estates, they were forc'd to
undergo a miserable Servitude. But what
<hi>Holinshed</hi> asserts, that the Right of Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll to the
<hi>Norman</hi> by Kindred, is so silly, that it needs
no Refutation: He says, that the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
was of the third, and <hi>Edward</hi> of the
second Degree of Consanguinity by <hi>Emma</hi>
Mother to <hi>Edward,</hi> and great Aunt to the
Conqueror. But pray, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> is it
customary with you in Hereditary King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
for the next of the Mother's Line to
succeed? Certainly in the Feudal Law, the
Mother's Line is not regarded, except in
Fees which descend from the Mother and
the Mother's Kindred, which obtains to
this Day in all the Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi>
that are govern'd by Customs and Laws:
But let us grant that an Heritage may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the next of the Mother's Line,
<hi>William</hi> was a Bastard, and acknowledges
himself to be such in that Charter which he
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52199:158"/>
grants to <hi>Alan</hi> Count of <hi>Britany,</hi> which is
to be seen in <hi>Cambden</hi>'s <hi>Richmond.</hi> But in
Law a Bastard can neither succeed nor have
any Successor.</p>
               <p>Let this be the third Warning to our
Neighbours, not to violate the Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession;
First in <hi>Modred,</hi> the second in <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> who being assisted
by your Forces, turn'd <hi>Alpin</hi> out of the
Succession to the Pictish Crown; but the
Destruction of the British Nation followed
the one, and that of the Picts followed the
other: the first being drove out of their
Country, retir'd into <hi>Wales,</hi> and the latter
being totally rooted out, have left none to
keep up their Name; both of them paying
dearly for rejecting the true Heir and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
but all that they suffered under the
Romans, by the Invasions of the Scots and
Picts, or at last by the Saxons, was but Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
play to what they suffer'd under the
Conqueror; for neither God nor Man (to
make use of the Phrase) were secure from
his Injuries, for he drove the English out
of all Benefices, and gave them to his <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
he melted down the Plate of the
Churches, he sold the Noblemens Estates to
those that bid most, he forc'd all the English
to swear Fealty and Homage, and laid grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Imposts upon private Mens Estates,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:52199:158"/>
and claim'd every thing as his own by the
Right of Conquest; he did moreover, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the Laws and Institutions of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
chang'd the antient Arms and Bearing,
and put the Norman Arms in their Stead;
and insulted over the English as unworthy
to enjoy any Estates: so that it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the height of Reproach to be call'd
an Englishman, says <hi>Cradock</hi> and <hi>Matthew
Paris;</hi> nay, he would have had the very
Name of <hi>England</hi> obliterated, says <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi>
and the Country to be called Great
<hi>Normandy.</hi> And therefore I advise you
again and again, not to be guilty any more
of rejecting the true Heir of the Crown.

is it agreeable to Law or Equity, that he

concluded in the Confines of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
by the Mediation of the Bishops;
and seeing the Terms of the same were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:52199:160"/>
upon the Conqueror than the King of
<hi>Scots,</hi> it may easily be inferred from thence,
that the Scots were then superior in Arms:
for the Conqueror demanding three things;
First, That all the English Exiles should be
given up; Secondly, That the King of
<hi>Scots</hi> should receive no English Exiles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards;
Thirdly, That the King of <hi>Scots</hi>
should acknowledg him for King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and do him Homage as usual for <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,
Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmoreland;
Malcolm</hi> agreed only to the last, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it did not belong to him to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
who had the Right to the Crown of
<hi>England;</hi> but the two first he did constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refuse, saying, that he would never be
wanting to any Englishman who sought
Sanctuary under him, and on the other
Hand, did urge, that the English Exiles
whom the Conqueror had dispoil'd, should
be restor'd to their Estates, and have a full
Pardon for all that was past. This, though
much against the Conqueror's Interest, he
granted however, against his Will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that he must otherwise have come
to a Battel; for the King of <hi>Scots</hi> had at
that time a most formidable Army, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compos'd of his own Subjects, but Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Exiles: The gallant <hi>Sivard</hi> Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>
had join'd his Nephew <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm</hi>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:52199:160"/>
out of Hatred to the Conqueror; so
that he was forced <hi>nolens volens,</hi> to restore
the English Exiles: most of them however
chose rather to stay with <hi>Malcolm,</hi> and gave
Name and Rise to many great Families
which are still in great Honour with us; and
therefore I wonder so much the more,
what induces the English to write, that the
King of <hi>Scots</hi> yielded himself to the King of
<hi>England.</hi> Nay <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> mentions a
double Surrender, though others do only
take notice of one, and will have it that
<hi>Malcolm</hi> became the Conqueror's Liege Man
(to use their own words) which imports
nothing more but that he did him Homage,
and the same is to be understood, when
<hi>Polidore</hi> says, that <hi>Malcolm</hi> swore Fealty to
the Conqueror, <hi>(in verba Conquestoris ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sse)</hi>
and therefore according to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the English Writers, <hi>Malcolm</hi>
did only perform that Homage which he
ow'd; but that it was perform'd for <hi>Scotland,</hi>
no Body writes but this <hi>Holinshed,</hi> and the
counterfeit <hi>Nicholas Adams.</hi> Let them then
turn over all the Writings of the Monks till
they sweat and pant, and let them unlock
all the Cabinets, they shall never find that
<hi>Malcolm</hi> perform'd Homage for <hi>Scotland,</hi>
which is the Point in Hand; for we do not
deny that Homage was perform'd as long as
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52199:161"/>
we held those Northern Provinces, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were taken away, there was neither
any due nor performed. In matters of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Judgment is never given except upon
clear E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dence, and how much less ought it
to be given in a Controversy which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Liberty not of one Man, but of
a whole Kingdom, and that the most Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in <hi>Europe.</hi> And in Law, as often as the
same Discourse will admit of two Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
that only is to be receiv'd which is
most agreeable to the thing transacted, and
makes for Liberty: Therefore what <hi>Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</hi>
or the Pettifogger <hi>Adams</hi> say, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
was perform'd, to the Conqueror for
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is altogether false.
But this is their ordinary way, that whenever
they find it mentioned that Homage was
perform'd to alledg, that it was for <hi>Scotland;</hi>
but if our Historians may be believed, there
was not so much as any Homage done at that
time: for the Conqueror having attempted
War upon <hi>Scotland</hi> unsuccessfuly, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when present in Person, that the Issue of
a War against the Scots might be dangerous,
he renewed the Peace, and restoring all
the English whom he had banish'd, returned
Home: nor can the English themselves as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
that he reap'd any other Advantage
from that War, though at the same time it

                  </gap>hing with <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore,</hi>
says, that when the two Kings stood in
Battel array, <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who
accompanied his Brother <hi>Rufus</hi> to the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52199:162"/>
Wars, perceiving <hi>Edgar Etheling</hi> in <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm</hi>'s
Army, and having been familiar with
him in times past, call'd upon him, and was
the first that mentioned a Peace; and by
their means the two Kings were reconcil'd
on these Conditions, That <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lcolm</hi> should
do the same Offices to <hi>Rufus</hi> which he had
perform'd to his Father, and that <hi>Rufus</hi>
should restore to <hi>Malcolm</hi> the twelve Towns
which <hi>William</hi> had withheld from him, and
pay him moreover ten Marks of Gold <hi>per
annum. Florence</hi> has the same thing, and
adds, that at their second Meeting, which
was without Arms, <hi>Rufus</hi> demanded of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
to come to a Trial at Law in his Courts;
but <hi>Malcolm</hi> flatly refused, although he was
his Liege-man, which does not at all agree
with the Homage then alledg'd to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.
<hi>Malmsbury</hi> has not any thing of the
Homage; but only makes mention of a
Peace, procured by <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy;</hi>
So that if <hi>Robert,</hi> who was Brother
to <hi>Rufus,</hi> was the first who mentioned a
Peace, that <hi>Rufus</hi> was oblig'd to yield up 12
Towns, and to pay 10 Marks of Gold year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as has been already mentioned. What is
asserted by the Monks <hi>Malmsbury</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veden,</hi>
that <hi>Malcolm</hi> being terrified with the
Appearance of War, did profess himself <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus</hi>'s
Liege-man, must needs be false: For he
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52199:163"/>
who first makes mention of Peace, is more
desirous of Peace than War; and he that
quits with his Possessions to obtain Peace, is
certainly inferiour in Arms. But our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
act according to their usual Custom, in
upbraiding us constantly with Cowardliness,
or something that is dishonourable. That
<hi>Malcolm</hi> became <hi>Rufus's</hi> Liege-man, we don't
deny; but upon what account he became so,
remains to be proved: but that it was for
<hi>Scotland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> you have no Author
to avouch.</p>
               <p>There remain still two Calumnies with
which our <hi>Malcolm</hi> is undeservedly charged
by most of the English Historians; one of
them his inhumane Cruelty towards <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>
when he ravag'd the same, and
the other that he and his eldest Son were
slain in plain Battel: And tho' those things
don't much concern the Question of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
which is the Subject of the present
Dispute, yet it is not to be pass'd over, that
all Men may see how unfaithfully our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
deal with us as to the Point of History.
For the first Calumny; there was not a more
merciful, pious nor magnanimous Prince than
<hi>Malcolm;</hi> &amp; there's an Instance of his Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Magnanimity recorded by <hi>Polydore</hi>
and <hi>Matthew Paris:</hi> but while the common
Rabble of English Historians search on all
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52199:163"/>
sides how they may reproach us, they are
not ashamed to charge us with the horrible
and barbarous Cruelties of the Danes; nay,
what their more antient Writers say of the
Cruelty of the Danes, they fasten Word for
Word upon our <hi>Malcolm.</hi> It may be indeed,
as <hi>Hoveden</hi> relates it, that when <hi>Cospatrick</hi>
(to whom the Conqueror gave the Earldom
of <hi>Northumberland</hi> that he might infest <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm</hi>
with War) harass'd <hi>Cumberland,</hi> which
did then belong to <hi>Malcolm,</hi> with Fire and
Sword, and besides other Cruelties burnt
down St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Church in <hi>Cumberland;</hi> it
may be, I say, that <hi>Malcolm,</hi> being enraged
at their violating the most sacred Places,
might command his Subjects to give no
Quarter, and leave the Souldiers to their
Liberty; otherwise it is very improbable, that
this most religious and pious Prince would
have done such things as they charge him
with. Nor are they content to throw those
Aspersions upon <hi>Malcolm,</hi> but also upon his
Son <hi>David,</hi> the most religious Prince that
ever was heard of, in the very same words.
Neither is there any more Truth in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Calumny, that <hi>Malcolm</hi> and his Son
were defeated and kill'd in Battel: It's a
known Story. For <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror
being very lavish of his Faith, as the English
themselves do testify, detain'd some Garisons
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:52199:164"/>
in <hi>Northumberland: Malcolm</hi> having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Restitution a long time, but in vain,
besieg'd <hi>Alnwick;</hi> and the Garison being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of all Relief, offered to surrender, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Moubray,</hi> Governor of the same, coming
out on Horseback with two Iron Keys on the
Point of his Spear, presented'em to the King,
as if he design'd to surrender: the King came
out of his Tent to receive them, and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>
putting Spurs to his Horse, ruu the Spear
into the King's Eye; and leaving him half
dead, was carried off by his swift Horse, on
the Confidence of whose Heels he undertook
this memorable Enterprize. <hi>Edward,</hi> eldest
Son to <hi>Malcolm,</hi> pursuing him, fell into an
Ambush which was laid to favour <hi>Moubray's</hi>
escape, and was also slain. Here's no Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nor no Armies which could fight: The
Scots Army carried on the Siege, and the
little Garison which resisted them offered to
surrender; or let them tell us if they can,
who in that Army were slain besides the two
Princes, or how many Colours were taken.
It is also plain, that from this Fact of <hi>Robert
Moubray's,</hi> does the most noble Family of the
<hi>Piercies</hi> derive their Name and Original.</p>
               <p>You will also have it, that <hi>Donald</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
King of <hi>Scots</hi> by <hi>Rufus,</hi> who did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
dethrone him, and substitute <hi>Duncan</hi>
in his room, and that both of them did Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52199:164"/>
to <hi>Rufus</hi> But you cannot produce one
antient Writer Mr. <hi>Holins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed,</hi> who says that
ever the English were allowed the Choice of
one of our Kings. We own, with <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi>
that <hi>Duncan</hi> dethron'd his Competitor
by the Assistance of <hi>Rufus,</hi> under whom he
did carry Arms for some time: For it was
then customary with the English, when we
were broken into Factions, to assist one of
the Parties, that they might either destroy
both, or when it fell out that there was War
betwixt the two Kingdoms, they might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
have a Faction amongst us: And this
was followed by our Country-men; who
when Parties were at variance, it was usual
for the weaker Side to have recourse to the
English for Assistance. <hi>Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bury, Hoveden,</hi>
and <hi>Huntington,</hi> do all of them take notice
that <hi>Duncan</hi> was made King of <hi>Scotland</hi> by
the Assistance of <hi>Rufus;</hi> and <hi>Westminster</hi>
and <hi>Polydore</hi> do also make mention of the
Homage: but there was no need of it; for
neither of them are numbred amongst the
Kings of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the Stories of <hi>Donald</hi>
and <hi>Duncan</hi> are very well known to us, <hi>viz.</hi>
that they were no lawful Heirs to the Crown,
but Tyrants and Invaders; and therefore
they were both of them justly depriv'd of
the Kingdom, and kill'd in the space of two
Years. But <hi>Holinshed</hi> won't take notice of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52199:165"/>
this, that <hi>Duncan</hi> was not admitted to the
Throne until he took an Oath that he would
entertain no English nor Norman Souldiers,
as is witnessed by <hi>Polydore</hi> in his 2d Book;
than which there can be nothing said more
contradictory to the Laws of Homage, or
Feudal Fealty, (if the Souldiers of his Lord,
and fellow Vassal, be not admitted into the
Fiduciary Kingdom:) And that same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
acquaints us, that all the English and
Normans which <hi>Duncan</hi> brought with him,
were driven out of <hi>Scotland</hi> by Force. This
was certainly a great piece of Stubborness in
a Vassal, and a piece of Ingratitude, for
which he deserv'd to have his Fee taken
away. But the Matter speaks of it self, <hi>viz.</hi>
that the King of <hi>England</hi> could not then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

his Subjects were not so much as allowed to

               <p>You write, that the most renowned Prince
<hi>Henry</hi> I. receiv'd Homage from <hi>Edgar</hi> and

Countries of <hi>Cumberland, Westmoreland</hi> and
<hi>Northumberland:</hi> For that most excellent
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52199:165"/>
Prince knowing the Norman Government
to be weak, and establish'd by no Law in
<hi>England,</hi> and that the Succession to both
Kingdoms was due to <hi>Margaret</hi> Queen of
<hi>Scots,</hi> and her Children, he obtain'd <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Daughter of <hi>Malcolm</hi> and <hi>Margaret,</hi> for
Wife, that he might from her at least derive
some Right to himself and Successors. This
<hi>Maud</hi> was afterwards called the Good; nor
is there any Queen of <hi>England</hi> whose Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is recommended to Posterity by so many
Praises and Encomiums as hers. This I take
notice of, that our Neighbours may perceive
that most of our Country-folks are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of an ingenuous Disposition; and that
Vertue and Education are in much esteem
with us, though they account us the most
barbarous and vile People in the World.
<hi>Henry</hi> then lived in a most friendly Manner
with the Scots; nor did he ever demand
Homage from that Prince, whose Sister he
married; or if he did, it was only on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Lands which the King of <hi>Scots</hi>

have left no place of Subterfuge for our

obtain'd the Possession of it. As to the Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress
of <hi>Huntington,</hi> we own it; but that he
had a Right to <hi>Northumberland, Cumberland</hi>
and <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> before that time, I have
proved sufficiently from your own Writers,
and even from your self Mr. <hi>Holinshed:</hi> So
that this necessary Conclusion of yours comes
to nothing; for though K. <hi>David</hi> was the
first that perform'd Homage for the County
of <hi>Huntington,</hi> it's certain that many of his
Ancestors perform'd the same for <hi>Cumberland,

                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:52199:166"/>You object, that <hi>David</hi> refused Homage

for neither could he perform, nor she receive
that, but for other Countries which the King
of <hi>Scots</hi> held of the English. Nor have you
any other Evidence but your own for this
Homage: <hi>Polydore, Newbriggs, Malmsbury,</hi>
and the rest, have nothing of this Homage per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd

any way help our Neighbours Cause, as I
said before. For we will grant that Homage
was perform'd to <hi>Maud,</hi> as the lawful Heiress
of her Father <hi>Henry</hi> I. but <hi>Polydore</hi> says only,
that K. <hi>David</hi> held <hi>Cumberland</hi> in the time of

that our League with <hi>France</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd

If you had writ simply, without any Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>Malcolm</hi> had perform'd Homage, it

I beseech the candid Reader that he
would forbear giving Judgment for a little
while, because the Hinge of the Controversy
turns wholly upon this <hi>Henry</hi> II. and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
I. and if I be not mistaken, the Truth
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52199:167"/>
of the Question will easily appear from the
English Annals themselves. We will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
divide the Reign of this <hi>Henry</hi> II. into
two Periods, <hi>viz.</hi> into that before his taking
<hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> Prisoner, and that
after. As to the first you write, Mr. <hi>Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,</hi>
that <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> perform'd
Homage for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland:</hi> But
in truth, this smells of excessive Boldness and
Impudence, to commit those things to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
which may be refuted out of other
Writers; and indeed we do all of us owe
Thanks to your <hi>Hoveden,</hi> and to <hi>Savil,</hi> who
lately took care to have him printed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have lighted a Torch to guide us
in this Controversy; whereas we should
have otherwise been in the Dark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hoveden</hi> then, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> does plainly
give you and all other English Writers, if
there be any who agree with you, the Lie<note n="*" place="margin">In prim. <hi>Hen.</hi> II.</note>
His Words are these; <q>That same Year
<hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> met the King of
<hi>England</hi> at <hi>Chester,</hi> and did him Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>age
in the same Manner as his Grand-father
perform'd it to old K. <hi>Henry</hi> II. <hi>with a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo
as to all his own Dignities.</hi>
                  </q> This is the
true Form of the Homage which was always
paid to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> by those of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> in which their own Dignities are
manifestly excepted. Now the King of <hi>Scots</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:52199:168"/>
had no other Dignities but <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
was preserv'd safe and entire in this Homage.
Neither was this only true as to <hi>Malcolm,</hi>
says <hi>Hoveden,</hi> but also as to his Grand-father
and Predecessors; and therefore if any Man
enquire after the Form of Homage paid by
<hi>Constantine</hi> to <hi>Athelstan,</hi> it necessarily follows
that the same was perform'd <hi>with a Salvo to
the Royal Dignity:</hi> And so the Homage was
perform'd to the Conqueror and <hi>Henry</hi> I. with
a Salvo to the Royal Authority, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more plainly afterwards in our <hi>William</hi>
and your <hi>Richard,</hi> that you may perceive I
deal fairly with you: So that the first part
of your Assertion evanishes; and you are
certainly a very hair-brain'd Fellow, and one
who lies at catch for other Mens Fame, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you are not asham'd to assert what you
cannot prove. That <hi>Malcolm</hi> accompanied
<hi>Henry</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> we don't deny; but that
he took Arms against the King of <hi>France,</hi> is
false: Nor could <hi>Malcolm</hi> avoid the Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Subjects notwithstanding; for
when he returned Home, the Scots being
highly enraged because they thought that he
had carried Arms against the King of <hi>France</hi>
his Ally, they besieged him until such time as
he clear'd himself of that Crime; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
them, that having gone to <hi>London</hi>
to perform Homage, he was compell'd by

Force to accompany the King of <hi>England</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

we may easily gather not only that this great
Prince was guilty of violating his solemn

                  </gap>erted by any but your self; or
if otherwise, tell us when, by what Methods,
or in what Place did this Rebellion happen:
But so it is ordered by Nature, that when a
Man delights in an Error, he falls into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of others for the defence of
that; and to render the first Lie probable,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:52199:169"/>
he is not afraid to make two or three more:
And thus one Error, like a teeming Sow,
brings forth abundance of others. As to the
Sentence of Adjudication I think nothing
strange; for how many times were <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
Aquitain,</hi> and the rest of the English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
which they hold in Fee, adjudg'd to
the Crown of <hi>France</hi> by the Senate of <hi>Paris?</hi>
and yet they were never restored until the
English were drove thence by force of Arms.
It's certain that the English themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that K. <hi>Henry</hi> did at that time violate his
Oath; and when the same was told him to
his Face by <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to say in excuse of himself, but that he
could not bear with such a Diminution of
his Kingdom: An excellent Way indeed of
eluding his Oath. Now if any of our Kings
had been guilty of such a Crime, how
strangely would you have insulted over us
as Perfidious, Perjur'd, and Enemies to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and whatever else your paultry Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
could have suggested; as you are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
to treat us on much slighter Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
And in truth, if we go through all the
Kings of <hi>England</hi> one by one, to the time of
<hi>Henry</hi> VII. there's not one of them whom
we shall not find guilty of breaking their
Oaths, even you your self being Witness in
your History Mr. <hi>Holinshed;</hi> but you cannot
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:52199:169"/>
perceive the Bunch on your own Back.

that while you rage against us, you quite

takes notice of the Exchange betwixt

that this County was never restored; for
you are so prodigal of your Faith, that you

the Matter of Fact as to this Homage, is to

the English Historians, had sworn Fealty
to <hi>Henry</hi> for the Counties of <hi>Huntington
Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> he hop'd by
this Obsequiousness, to have also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

finding that the King of <hi>England</hi> invented
causes of Delay, he return'd Home very
angry, with a Design to recover his Right

when Right cannot be obtain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

an Ambush, (for our Princes were always

his Grandfather, who expos'd himself
so often to defend <hi>Henry's</hi> Dignity, prevail
any thing in favour of <hi>William.</hi> And here
you say, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> that he was oblig'd
to part with <hi>Huntington, Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi>
for his Ransom; from which it
is apparent, that he was not only then in
Possession of <hi>Huntington,</hi> but also of <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> which you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
to have been taken from him a little
before; for he recovered <hi>Northumberland</hi>
from <hi>Henry</hi> the Son, as is witness'd by <hi>Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:</hi>
Therefore it is certain that the King
of Scots did always owe Homage for <hi>Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
all your former Arguments.</p>
               <p>But you think this an invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prove your vain Babling, <hi>viz.</hi> that
King William offered a Cloak, a Saddle and
lance, at the High Altar in <hi>York-Minster,</hi>
in Token of Homage. But pray, Mr. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshed,</hi>
could not he offer those things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
professing himself a Subject to the King
of <hi>England,</hi> or what reference has that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Fealty or Superiority of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
But every corrupt Judg, says <hi>Horace,</hi>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:52199:172"/>
is a bad enquirer into the Truth. <hi>Lewis</hi>
King of <hi>France</hi> offer'd at the Tomb of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
the Martyr, (as he is call'd by <hi>Hoveden</hi>)
a very large and valuable Golden Cup, and
gave for the use of the Monks who serv'd
there, 100 Vessels of Wine for ever, to be
received at <hi>Poysy</hi> in <hi>France</hi> every Year at the
sole Charge of the King of <hi>France,</hi> with an
immunity from all Taxes, for whatever was
bought for the use of the said Monks in
<hi>France;</hi> must <hi>Lewis</hi> therefore be said to
have paid Homage to the King of <hi>England</hi>
because of this Oblation? So much for the
time which preceded <hi>William's</hi> being made
Prisoner. You add amongst other Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Ransom, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> that
<hi>William</hi> promised that he and his Successors
should hold the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> in
Fee of the King of <hi>England</hi> for ever. I shall
not deny the matter of Fact, which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
by so many English Historians, the
Tenour of the Charter or Indenture being
also exhibited by <hi>Hoveden, Matthew Paris</hi>
and others, whereby <hi>William</hi> in express
Terms, without any Circumlocution or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Clause, confesses, that he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
the King of <hi>England</hi> his Liege Lord for
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but I must say,
that it was not only contrary to all Law, but
Humanity it self, to require of a Man who
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:52199:172"/>
was not his own Master, but a Captive, and
at that time a Subject of <hi>England,</hi> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of Superiority over <hi>Scotland.</hi>
Let the Law of Nations plead for us, for all
Kingdoms agree in this, that there lies a
Claim of Restitution against all Actions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
by Violence and Force: or let us
have the Benefit of the English Law at least,
according to the Answer of <hi>William Brivier,</hi>
one of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d's Counsellors, to
the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
when they demanded a Confirmation
of their Liberties by the King, <hi>viz. That the
Liberties which they sought, ought not to be
observ'd in Law, because they were extorted by
Violence.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Matthew Paris <hi>in</hi> Hen. III.</note> And therefore the Scots who
serv'd under <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh then <hi>Dauphin
of France,</hi> were altogether in the right in
their Answer to King <hi>Iames</hi> I. (whom <hi>Henry
V. of England</hi> had taken at Sea, contrary
to the Faith of a Truce, and carried with
him to <hi>France,</hi> that he might command the
Scots to quit the French Service) <hi>viz.</hi> That
they did not acknowledg him for King, so
long as he was in the Power of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and therefore would not obey his
Commands seeing they were not his Subjects.
For other wise he being at that time a Subject
of <hi>England,</hi> they did reasonably infer, that they
must also become such if they
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52199:173"/>
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd him for their Liege Lord. Certainly
he who is in the Power of an Enemy, or
detain'd Captive, may easily be compell'd
to do any thing; but the Laws allow him
this relief, that being once at Liberty, he is
not oblig'd to perform what he promis'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Will, and therefore whatever was
done, said or promis'd by King <hi>William</hi> then
in the Power of his Enemies, detain'd so
many Years in strict Custody, and having
no Hopes of redeeming himself otherwise,
is accounted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

(to use the Law-Phrase) to make this

call'd <hi>coeur de Lion, i. e.</hi> Lion's
Heart, when he was sold by <hi>Leopold</hi> to the
Emperor <hi>Henry,</hi> and saw no other way of
delivering himself from his Captivity, he did
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52199:173"/>
divest himself of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
it to the Emperor as Universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
and invested him with his Hat, and the
Emperor did straightway, as was agreed on
or commun'd before hand in the Presence of
the Peers of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> restore
him the foresaid Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> to be
held of him the said Emperor, on an Annual
Tribute of 5000 l. <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and thereupon
he invested <hi>Richard</hi> with a double Crown of
Gold; but the said Emperor did afterwards
on his Death-bed quit Claim the said <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
and his Heirs of those and all other
Agreements.</p>
               <p>Let those two Princes <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi>
and their Actions while Captives be
compar'd, and we shall find that one Egg is
not more like another, for both of them in
their Captivity subjected their Kingdoms to
the Power of another: but it's perhaps
more dishonourable on <hi>Richard's</hi> part, who
promis'd to pay 5000 l. <hi>Sterlin</hi> annually as
a Tribute; and both of them being at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
obtain'd a Remission of this Homage
which was extorted by Violence, either
from the Lords themselves, or their Heirs.
In <hi>Richard's</hi> Case there was the Emperor's
Investiture, in <hi>William's</hi> none: therefore the
English must either be very partial in their
own Case, or acknowledg the same thing
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52199:174"/>
against themselves, which they object against
us, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King of <hi>England</hi> did
sometime pay Homage to the Emperor for
the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> as I made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before in the Comparison betwixt our
<hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Ethelred</hi> King of <hi>England,
Constantine</hi> having only made a Surrender,
(if it be true what the English say concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him) but it is certain that <hi>Ethelred</hi> did
reign precariously under <hi>Sueno;</hi> so that they
can find nothing in our <hi>William,</hi> but what
they may find in their own <hi>Richard:</hi> For as
to <hi>Henry</hi> II. the Subject of the present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
no Body did ever esteem him a good
Man, for the few Vertues that he had were
exceeded, or at least equall'd by his Vices;
and being unmindful of the Oath which he
had sworn to our <hi>David</hi> his Uncle, never
to redemand <hi>Cumberland, Northumberland</hi>
and <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> he sought by all manner
of ways, that is, by Force and Fraud, to seize
them as the King of <hi>France</hi> did the English
Fees which they held beyond-Sea; for that's
a Fault natural to most Kings, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to enlarge their Dominions right
or wrong. But this did not pass unpunish'd
in <hi>Henry,</hi> for on his Death-Bed he curs'd
himself and his Childen, and the Day of his
Birth; nor could he ever be prevail'd on by
the Bishops to absolve his Children from
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:52199:174"/>
that Curse, though they did inculcate how
much he hazarded his Salvation thereby,
But his Son <hi>Richard</hi> made an intire Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to King <hi>William,</hi> renounced those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
that had been extorted from him, and
declared the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> free from
Homage for all time coming, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
testify'd, that the Homage which was
perform'd by his Brother <hi>Malcolm</hi> and his
Predecessors, <hi>were only for the Dignities or
Privileges which they held in</hi> England: and
<hi>Richard</hi> did mightily exceed his Father in
Vertue; for <hi>Hoveden</hi> says, that he did very
much enlarge his Father's good Deeds, and
diminish'd his evil Ones; those whom his
Father disinherited, he restored to their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Rights, whom his Father banish'd he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd,
whom his Father imprison'd he let go
free, and those on whom his Father did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
several Punishments unjustly, the Son
did cherish and refresh. Let us also hear
<hi>Hoveden's</hi> words concerning the renouncing
of this Homage, for he liv'd very near those
times<note n="*" place="margin">In the first Part of the Annals of <hi>Richard I.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:52199:176"/>Now do not those two Forms of Homage,
the one for his Dignities, and the other for

you had rather that you your self should

of Perjury: for if you have them not
when you say you have them, you are guilty
of writing a Falshood; but if you really
have them, you charge your Country-men
with Perjury; when both here, and in
the Peace which was agreed on betwixt
<hi>Edward</hi> III. and <hi>David Bruce,</hi> the King and
Peers of <hi>England</hi> declared upon Oath, that
all those Monuments which contain'd any
Subjection of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were faithfully resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
as you your self do also write: And
<hi>Richard</hi> himself confesses that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
that Charter or Indenture, which
K. <hi>William</hi> had made during his Captivity,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:52199:177"/>
to hold the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> in Fee of the

be retain'd through Forgetfulness
they are to be esteem'd void and null Don't
you see Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> what Snares you have
brought your self into? As to what concerns
those four Castles, they were delivered as
Pledges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that on paiment of the Money
they were restored. But you say, that the
Scots will never be able to prove that the
Money was paid. It cannot indeed be easily
proved at such an Interval of time, yet the
Presctintion of so many Ages takes away all
Right of Demand; and the Restitution of
the four Castles which were laid in pledg,
give ground to presume that the Debt was
paid. The Testimony of <hi>Robert Mountain</hi>
which you adduce, is to: no purpose. By
these it's as clear as the Sun shine, that there
were two Homages perform'd by <hi>William;</hi>
one for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was
extorted by Force from him while he was
a Prisoner, and is therefore called a <hi>New
Charter,</hi> because there was no such Charter
for Homage for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi>
before that: And I pray you, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi>
what need was there of a New Charter of
Homage for <hi>Scotland,</hi> if there had been any
old one? Or what need was there to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for that afresh, which you say was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
provided for from the first Original
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:52199:177"/>
of <hi>England?</hi> And as to those Lands which
he had in <hi>England,</hi> whether in Demain or in
Fee, <hi>viz.</hi> in the County of <hi>Huntington,</hi>
(which according to you, was lately taken
from him, and never restored) K. <hi>Richard</hi>
says in plain terms, that <q>K. <hi>William</hi> and his
Heirs shall for ever possess them in as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
manner as <hi>Malcolm</hi> did or ought to
have possess'd them; and if his Father
granted any thing to K. <hi>William,</hi> he ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and confirm'd the same: And declares,
that he restores all those Allegiances and
Charters which <hi>Henry</hi> extorted from him
during his Captivity.</q> So that there cannot
be a more express Renunciation in Law,
than the Restitution of the Obligation by
the Creditor to the Debtor; and if it should
fall out that any others hapned to be found,
or were retain'd through Forgetfulness, the
King declares them void and null; reserving
however, the Homage of those Lands for
which <hi>William's</hi> Ancestors were Liege-men
to his Ancestors.</p>
               <p>For the better understanding of the Clause
in this Charter, which is conceived in those
Words; <hi>As to his safe Conduct, coming to,
returning from, or staying in our Court:</hi> We
must know that it relates to a Controversy
betwixt the King of <hi>England</hi> and King of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> as Prince of <hi>Cumberland, Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> concerning the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52199:178"/>
of the King of <hi>England's</hi> Court;
and whether the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> because he
was his Vasial, ought to appear in the same.
The King of <hi>Scots</hi> denied that he ought to
appear in Person at that Court which was
held without the Limits of his Fee. The
King of <hi>England</hi> insisted on it, that he ought
to appear where-ever he held his Court. The
Controversy was decided by the Feudal
Law thus; That the Vassal is not obliged
to appear in the Court of his Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Bounds of his Fee, but at his Lord's
Charge; and therefore it was transacted,
that as often as the King of <hi>Scots</hi> should be
call'd to the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Court, it
should be at the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Expence;
and that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> should be receiv'd
on the Borders of <hi>England</hi> by the Nobility
of <hi>England, viz.</hi> one Bishop, one Earl, some
Lords and some Knights; who should also
attend him back again to his own Borders
at the King of <hi>England's</hi> Charges, who was
to allow the King of <hi>Scots 5 l.</hi> Sterlin <hi>per
diem</hi> for his own Expence. That would seem
but a small sum now, though it was then
very great, as will appear, if we examine
the old Accounts of the English Exchequer.
Those things I have touch'd before, and
should not insist any further on the Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Controversy, but that <hi>Holinshed's</hi>
Sawciness is to be quell'd; and that I am
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:52199:178"/>
forc'd to it by the violent Extortion of that
same Homage from us by <hi>Edward</hi> I. seeing
nothing can be said in more plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess

               <p>
                  <hi>HOlinshed</hi> adds, That during the Reign
of this <hi>Henry</hi> II. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>
granted the Jurisdiction over all the Scots
Bishops, to the Arch-bishop of <hi>York;</hi> which
he reckons a concluding Argument, that the
Scots were also subject to the English in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals.
This place does require it, nor does
there occur a greater Conveniency for it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
to discuss this Question, which is
so often hit in our Teeth by <hi>Holinshed</hi> and
<hi>Polidore, viz.</hi> that the Arch bishop of <hi>York</hi>
originally had, and continues to have the
Right of Jurisdiction and Superiority over
all the Bishops of <hi>Scotland;</hi> that by this
Trick they may cunningly open and pave
the Way to the whole Superiority, though
it is not the same in Temporals as in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:52199:180"/>
For Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
depended on the Pleasure of the
Pope; but Temporals are determin'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law and Equity, and the Bonds
of Humane Society: And therefore let's in
the first place, examine the Form of this
Conclusion. We except against it as being
founded upon no Reason nor Rule of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
for it's a perfect <hi>Nonsequitur,</hi> that
because the Scots Bishops are subject to the
Arch-bishop of <hi>York</hi> in Ecclesiastical Affairs,
therefore the King of <hi>Scots</hi> ought to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the King of <hi>England</hi> in Temporals:
For by the same Argument, because the
whole Christian World is, or at least was
subject to the Pope in Spirituals, therefore
they must also be subject in Temporals; and
thus all Kings ought to receive their Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the Pope only. So all Diocesans
acknowledg their Bishops, Barons and other
Vassals acknowledg the Rectors of the
Churches and their Vicars, their Superiours
in Spirituals; yet they don't therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
them their Lords in Temporals.
What Benefit of yours is there here? What
Exploit, what Valour, what Martial Glory,
is there in this, that you would thence inser
a Superiority over the Kingdom? It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a meer Paralogism; if because the
Scots Bishops received their Consecration
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:52199:180"/>
from the Arch-bishop of <hi>York,</hi> therefore
<hi>Scotland</hi> is subject to <hi>England.</hi> Who would
think that the English should argue thus,
amongst whom Philosophy is diligently cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
in all its parts, but that their Passion
perverts their Judgment: For he was in the
right, who said
<q>Impedit i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>We shall say no more of the Form of this
first Argument; but let's examine the Truth
of this Proposition, Whether the Scots Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
did in antient Times own the Arch-bishop
of <hi>York</hi> as their Superiour; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was not in the Reign of this <hi>Henry</hi> II.
that it was first ambitiously obtain'd by the
Pope's Charter, and stifled in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning?
But to repeat this Matter from the
Original, the Proof of the Proposition
is brought from the Institution of three
Arch-flamins and Twenty eight Flamins, by
<hi>Beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

<hi>Brennus</hi> who is said to have burnt <hi>Rome,</hi>
and were afterwards converted into three
Arch-bishops and Twenty eight Bishops, by
<hi>Lucius</hi> the first Christian King of <hi>Britain.</hi>
But for my own part, I look upon all this
Institution of <hi>Belinus,</hi> and the Expedition of
his Brother <hi>Brennus</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> when he is
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:52199:181"/>
said to have taken, plunder'd, and burnt
<hi>Rome,</hi> and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

to spend their time. Nor is there any Reason
to be more favourable to the Story of <hi>Ioseph</hi>
of <hi>Arimathea's</hi> coming to preach in <hi>Britain</hi>
Or if our Neighbours think otherwise, let
them, or any others who patronize those
Fables, tell me whence they had those things,
what Writer or Author conveyed them
down to Posterity, and where they found
it writ, painted, or suggested, and I shall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
yield. For my own part, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of which I am more desirous than that
<hi>Britain's</hi> Glory should be consecrated to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Fame; but I am not well pleased
to have Fables obtruded upon us instead of
Truth.</p>
               <p>To return to our Bishops: The Pope,
says <hi>Holinshed,</hi> who was then believed to
have a Jurisdiction over all Bishops, did by
his Bull ordain, that all Scots Bishops, should
receive their Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cration from the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>York</hi> as their Superiour, and that
according to the antient Laws and Statutes.
But, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> if it was only believ'd that
the Pope did so preside, that he could invert
the Dignities of the Church, and make one
which was free before a Servant and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:52199:181"/>
he did certainly put a Trick upon
you, when he was only supposed to have
that Power which he had not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Bull is null and void, you your self
being witness: Nor is it founded upon any
shadow of Reason. But what if he had had
that Power which he was believed to have,
is there any Body so ignorant of the Canon-Law
as not to know that the Pope does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
tie up his own Hands; and that he shuts
his Boso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> against none, but what he hath
establish'd by one Bull he can revoke by
another, especially if he can say that he hath
done it from his certain Knowledg; and that
what he granted to day to the Arch-bishop
of <hi>York</hi> contrary to Law, that he could not
afterwards revoke it according to Law? For
it is certain, that when the Scots complained
grievously of this Bull, the Pope being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>to
induc'd by good Motives, did grant as
much power to the Scots Arch-bishops as to
the English, as shall be declared anon. But
you assert, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> that this Privilege
granted to the Arch-bishop of <hi>York,</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws and Antient Statutes.
Then I pray you, Sir, if you have any Law
or Statute by which the Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Bishops are
subjected to the Arch-bishop of <hi>York;</hi> if
there be any Pragmatical Sanction, or if you
have any Ordinance or Decree either of

Oecumenical or Provincial Council, why
don't you produce, or at least quote them?
Say under what Consul, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Pope
this Privilege was granted, if you would
have us to believe you: but you have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
your self in this Affair with so much Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
and Frowardness, that you are not
to be believed even though you were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Oath? However, that this whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
concerning the English and Scots
Bishops may be discuss'd from its Original, I
will make it appear, that the Scots did not
only lay the Foundation of the Archbishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
of <hi>York,</hi> but of Christianity it self in
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then to pass over that most silly Fable of
the three Archflamins, and the twenty eight
Flamins; it's plain that there was no Bishop
in <hi>Britain</hi> before <hi>Palladius,</hi> who is by the
English themselves called the Bishop of the
<hi>Scots;</hi> or if either the Brittons or English
have any, let them name them, and at what

he liv'd about the Time of the Saxon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:52199:183"/>
the Controversy about <hi>Easter-day,</hi> which
had also disquieted the Primitive Church for
too Years, was very prejudicial to the Scots,
who did therein stoutly oppose the Pope,
and followed the Custom of the Eastern
Church, though they were oblig'd by the
Pope to relinquish their Opinion afterwards.
However there are many Episcopal Sees,

from the Subject in Hand. During all the
Time from <hi>Paulinus to Egbert,</hi> Brother to
King <hi>Egbert,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Yark</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with the single Name of Bishop: But
<hi>Egbert</hi> being of an high Mind because he
was Brother to a King, and finding the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop's
Pall which Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> had sent to
<hi>Paulinus</hi> the first Bishop who had rejected
it, he put it upon himself without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or Authority, and so of a Bishop made
himself Archbishop, and was the first who
was called Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> having
taken the Pall without a Grant from any
one. There were others who succeeded him
until the Time of the Conquest, and yet
all the Time of the Saxon Monarchy there's
no mention made of the Scotish Bishops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
subject to the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> or
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:52199:184"/>
having sworn Obedience to him. Nay, the
English themselves don't assert it, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that that Privilege was granted to the
See of <hi>York</hi> by latter Popes, <hi>viz. Paschal</hi>
and <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, that they should
preside over the Scots Bishops, who had not
as yet an Archbishop of their own, that
they might be consecrated by him. But
<hi>Polidore</hi> is very like to be in the right, when
he says, that those Popes endeavoured to
subject the Scots Bishops to the Archbishop
of <hi>York:</hi> the Scots protesting against it in
general, and appealing to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>
the Controversy was referred to Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
who did not decide the same; though
honest <hi>Holinshed</hi> affirms, that it was decreed
by this very <hi>Alexander,</hi> that the Scots Bishops
should be subject to the Archbishop of <hi>York;</hi>
whereas <hi>Polidore</hi> calls it, only an Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of those Popes, not an absolute Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
but that the whole Controversy
was suspended by an Appeal: and <hi>Polidore</hi>
owns, that he had only seen Copies of those
Bulls, but not the Bulls themselves. <hi>Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
who hath writ four Books concerning
the Transactions of the English Bishops,
promises in the Proem of his third Book,
whose particular Title is, Concerning the
Archbishops of <hi>York,</hi> that he will omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that ever he met with in the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:52199:184"/>
of his Ancestors, reading of Books or
his own proper Knowledg, and yet in that
whole Treatise concerning the Dignity of
the See of <hi>York,</hi> he has not one word of
the Subjection of the Scotish Bishops, tho
afterwards in the Reign of <hi>William,</hi> being
deceiv'd by common Opinion, he reckons
all the Scots Bishops, and amongst others the
Bishop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> the Suffragans of <hi>York,</hi>
being ignorant that neither in that Age, nor
for some Ages after, was there any Bishop
of <hi>Orkney;</hi> neither is the Bishop of <hi>Orkney</hi>
mentioned amongst the Scots Bishops in that
Bull of Pope <hi>Clements,</hi> of which afterwards.
If our Neighbours shall perchance argue,
that in the Time of the Conqueror, <hi>Thomas</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> did consecrate <hi>Michael</hi>
Elect of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and <hi>Turgot</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews;</hi>
I answer, that that is no Argument of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority,
for Bishops were wont to receive
Consecration from others who were not
their Superiors: for <hi>Richard</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> Elect, was consecrated by <hi>Henry</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> as was also <hi>Roger</hi> Bishop
of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Hugh</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> that
same day, yet none of them acknowledg'd
the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> their Superior; and
<hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Whitehorn</hi> was consecrated
by <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dublin</hi> at <hi>Pipenel,</hi> and
<hi>William Malvaise</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> was
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:52199:185"/>
consecrated by the Bishop of <hi>Lions</hi> in
<hi>France:</hi> For our Countrymen chose to be
consecrated by those whom Fame gave out
to excel in Learning and Piety. But if they
still go on and say, that the Scots had then
no Archbishop, and therefore must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
have been subject to the Archbishop
of <hi>York</hi> as nearest, seeing they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Consecration as they call it from any
other; I answer, that according to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Law, the Consent or Authority of an
Archbishop is not requir'd to the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Bishop: For it is statute by the
Canon Law, that when a Bishop is ordain'd,
two Bishops should lay Hands upon him and
hold the Gospel over his Head, and one of
them repeating the Benediction over him,
the rest shall touch his Head. And an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
according to the Canon Law, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Ordinary of a Province; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if <hi>Scotland</hi> be not a Kingdom, yet the
English themselves will own it to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
in which the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi>
ought not to claim any Jurisdiction, seeing
the same was without his Province. Nay,
if I had to do with one who understood the
Canon Law, I doubt not but I could easily
prove, that not only Bishops, but sometimes
also Archbishops were consecrated by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:
I alledg'd some Examples before, and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:52199:185"/>
more occure every where in <hi>Hoveden, Paris</hi>
and other English Writers. I confess, that
the English were before us in courting those
Dignities, and that there were Archbishops
in <hi>England</hi> before there were any in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
but seeing those Titles had their rise
meerly from Ambition, and were usually
purchas'd from the Pope by Money, in which
the English did always abound, we don't
envy them to our Neighbours: for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Ierom</hi> is in the Right, who says, <hi>A
Bishop and Presbyter are the same, and until
that by the Instinct of the Devil, there arose
Dissentions in Religion, and that People began
to say, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>I am of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and
I am of</hi> Apollo, <hi>the Churches were govern'd
by the common Consent of Presbyters: then
what would he have said, or rather what would
be not have said if in his time some had been
call'd Archbishops, and some simple Bishops?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we must return to those Disputes
which sometimes happened concerning this
Controversy, whether the Scots Bishops did
owe Subjection and Obedience to the Bishop
of <hi>York:</hi> amongst other things which King
<hi>William</hi> promis'd to <hi>Henry</hi> during his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
before he could be set at Liberty,
this is one that he should bring the Scots
Bishops to a Conference and Dispute with
the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> before the Bishops
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:52199:186"/>
of England, <hi>and compel them to do what
should appear to be just and equal. The
Kings of</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> England <hi>did thereupon
meet at</hi> Northampton: <hi>But it is better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat</hi>
Hoveden<hi>'s words; William</hi> brought with
him <hi>Richard</hi> Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews, Jocelin</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Glasgow, Richard</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel,
Christian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Whitehorn, Andrew</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Caithness, Simon</hi> Bishop of <hi>Murray,</hi>
and the rest of the `Priors and Abbots of his
Kingdom: Who being conveen'd before their
Lord the King of <hi>England,</hi> their Lord the
King commanded them upon their Allegiance,
and the Oath of Fealty which they had sworn to
him, that they should show the same Subjection
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to do in the Reign of the Kings his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.
<hi>To which they answered,</hi> That they
never were subject to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
nor ought to show any Subjection thereunto. <hi>To
which</hi> Roger <hi>Arch bishop of</hi> York <hi>replied, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,</hi>
that the Bishops of <hi>Glasgow</hi> and
<hi>Whitehorn</hi> were subject to the See of <hi>York</hi> in
the time of the Arch bishop's Predecessors; and
did thereupon demonstrate, and sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the Privileges granted to the Sea of <hi>York</hi>
upon that Head by the Popes. <hi>To which</hi> Iocelin
<hi>Bishop of</hi> Glasgow <hi>rejoin'd,</hi> that the Church of
<hi>Glasgow</hi> was a peculiar Daughter to the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and exempted from all Subjection to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:52199:186"/>
any other Bishops or Arch-bishops; and although
the See of <hi>York</hi> had the Superiority for some
time over the See of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> yet it is plain that
she never deserv'd it: And because <hi>Richard</hi>
Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> endeavoured to have
had the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> subject to his See, he
effected so much against the King of <hi>England,</hi>
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e permitted the Scots Bishops to return
home without making any Submission to the
Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we should diligently examine this Story,
which is horribly perverted by <hi>Hoveden,</hi> the
Controversy would easily be decided. The<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Scots had not then any Arch-bishop; and
the Bishops supposing that they ought to be
consecrated by a Superiour, were accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to go to the Arch-bishop of <hi>York,</hi> as the
nearest, to receive Consecration; which was
a foolish Superstition, seeing Bishops might
have been consecrated by Bishops, as I said
before: and therefore the Question was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
To whom the Right of consecrating the
Scots Bishops did appertain? The Kings
then met at <hi>Northampton,</hi> and both of them,
with the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the
rest of the English Bishops, sat as Judges. The
Arch-bishop of <hi>York</hi> being Plaintiff, propos'd
his Plea; wherein he did not alledg that all
the Scots Bishops ow'd him Subjection, but
only those of <hi>Glasgow</hi> and <hi>Whitehorn;</hi> and as
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:52199:187"/>
to their Subjection, he produc'd Bulls from
the Popes: And therefore it's false what <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore</hi>
and other English Writers assert, that
the Pope granted a Superiority over all the
Scots Bishops to the Arch-bishop of <hi>York.</hi>
But the Bishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> did clear himself
and his Collegue, by this Answer; That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Pope had granted such a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
to the Arch-bishop of <hi>York</hi> by Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that yet Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> being well
inform'd of the Injustice of his Predecessor,
did free all the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the
Jurisdiction of the Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> and all
other foreign Jurisdiction but that of the
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And the Bull of Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is also recorded by <hi>Hoveden;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when both Parties held by the Pope's
Bull, they parted without doing any thing,
which <hi>Hoveden</hi> ascribes to the Arch-bishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Fraud. But however that is,
'tis plain both from <hi>Hoveden</hi> and <hi>Polydore,</hi>
that the Question was not then decided, but
left to the Pope; and what was his Opinion
in the Affair, we shall see when we come to
<hi>Edward III.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what has been said then, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> what <hi>Holinshed</hi> afferts concerning
the Scots Bishops being first subject to the
Arch-flamin, and afterwards to the Arch-bishop
of <hi>York,</hi> is altogether false; for if the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:52199:187"/>
ambitious Arch-bishop of <hi>York</hi> did by any
indirect Means obtain a Bull from the Pope,
his Successor being mov'd with the Equity
of the thing, did annul the same; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
that the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> after he
had enumerated all their Bishops, should be
immediately subject to the Apostolick See,
whereof she was a peculiar Daughter, and
none should dare to pronounce a Sentence
of Excommunication, or Interdict, against
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> except the Pope
himself, or some <hi>Legat a Latere;</hi> and that
if any happened to be pronounc'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
it should be <hi>ipso facto</hi> void and null:
adding, that none might exercise the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Legate in <hi>Scotland</hi> but a Native
of the Kingdom; and that no <hi>Controversy</hi>
should be carried out of the Kingdom, but
in the case of an Appeal to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
And as there are many other things to this
purpose in the same Bull, which here I pass
over; so it is evident, that all this Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
Ecclesiastical Superiority, with the
Fictitious Homage, depends on a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
or Paralogism, and dwindles into
nothing. Most Men will perhaps think
that I confound things, by ascribing what
was done in <hi>Richard</hi>'s time to that of his
Father <hi>Henry;</hi> but I could not do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
for seeing that Homage which
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:52199:188"/>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> II. extorted by Violence and Injustice
from K. <hi>William,</hi> when he was a Captive,
was declared to have been so by <hi>Richard</hi>
his Son; it was necessary to join the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion
of the Homage by the Father, with
the Renunciation of the same by the Son.
I come now to <hi>Richard.</hi>

               <p>YOU write, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> that <hi>William</hi>
King of <hi>Scots,</hi> did Homage to K. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he assisted him with Money for his
Ransom to the Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> you will
needs have it that he did it as his Subject.
It's but sorry Thanks that you return him
for his Bounty: We confess that he gave
him Money for a part of his Ransom; but
that he did it as his Subject, is your Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as a true Trifler and Sophist. For your
most angust Queen hath lent Money to the
French King, Netherlanders, and many others,
which perhaps she will never have again.
I say nothing of our selves, whom she hath
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:52199:188"/>
very often assisted with Money; but if
therefore any body should infer that she
was subject either to the French, to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders,
or us, he were justly to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a mad Man. The same may be said
as to <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. who lent 300000 Angels
to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. and yet was not
therefore reckoned a Liege-Vassal to the
Spaniard. But of this Homage neither <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,
Newbriggs,</hi> nor <hi>Stow,</hi> make any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It's certain that he ow'd Homage at
that time upon the Restitution of <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Westmoreland;</hi> which both our
Writers and yours, take notice to have been
restored upon paying his Ransom: And it is
wanifest that many Offices of the strietest
Friendship pass'd betwixt <hi>Richard</hi> I. and
<hi>William;</hi> for before that <hi>Richard</hi> undertook
his Expedition into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
Auxiliary Forces from K. <hi>William,</hi> and
invested their General <hi>David,</hi> Brother to
<hi>William,</hi> with the County of <hi>Huntington,</hi>
who did him faithful and gallant Service in
the Holy War: And <hi>Richard</hi> standing in
need of Money at his return, all are agreed
that <hi>William</hi> furnish'd him with some; which
you pervert, and alledg that he did it as his
Subject. <hi>Richard,</hi> as I said before, was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to none that ever swayed the English
Scepter for Goodness of Disposition, and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:52199:189"/>
Magnanimity: But he was very unfortunate
in his Return from the Holy War; for first
being shipwrackt upon the Coast of <hi>Istria</hi> as
he return'd, he was known and kept Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by D. <hi>Leopold,</hi> whom he had offended in
that War; and being by him sold to the
Emperour <hi>Henry,</hi> he was forc'd to accept of
hard Terms of Ransom: and though K. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
and he were much of the same Temper
and Disposition, yet it appears by <hi>Hoveden</hi>
that there was a sharp Contest betwixt them
for <hi>Northumberland,</hi> which <hi>Richard</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firous
to retain, and <hi>William</hi> claimed it as the
Inheritance of his Brother <hi>Malcolm,</hi> who had
possess'd it for many Years. The Matter how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was composed during their Time, as if
it had been by a silent Transaction, while
each of them was permitted to enjoy what
he possess'd peaceably; so much did a Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Disposition reconcile them. Don't
you see then, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> that you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Performance of this Homage by a
reproachful Interpretation, contrary to the
Authority of your own Writers? And the
Homage which <hi>William</hi> perform'd for the
Dignities which he held in <hi>England,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
words, you do without Evidence or
Authority, obtrude upon the World as if it
had been perform'd for the Kingdom of
<hi>Scotland.</hi> Then where's your Understanding,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:52199:189"/>
your Reason, your Modesty, and the Care of
your Reputation, which is the chief thing
that is regarded by all honest Men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> the Father, was the first who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
Homage to K. <hi>Iohn;</hi> but <hi>Hoveden</hi>
testifies, that it was for <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi>
that by this ready Obedience
he might also prevail with him fairly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
<hi>Northumberland:</hi> But as to the Tricks
by which he was eluded, <hi>Hoveden</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
enough. However, this Homage was
not for <hi>Scotland</hi> as you dream, which is very
familiar to you.</p>
               <p>But let us hear <hi>Polydore;</hi> The King of
<hi>Scots,</hi> says he, came to <hi>London</hi> to salute
<hi>Iohn,</hi> and is said to have taken his Oath,
(he does not affirm it for a Certainty, nor
yet that it was for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi>)
being desired to assist him in his War against
the King of <hi>France,</hi> he refus'd; than which
Refusal there could be nothing more said or
writ against this Homage; for he who owes
Homage, is obliged to perform Military Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to his Lord whether it be required or
not.</p>
               <p>The Letters of the Pope, that he might
have the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Assistance for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
the Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> can
have no weight with any Man; for that has
always been customary with the Popes to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:52199:190"/>
set Neighbouring Princes together by the
ears. But let's hear the Words of the Letter,
which is exhibited by <hi>Hoveden;</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Clement</hi>
desires the King of <hi>England</hi> that he would
advise his Son <hi>William,</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
more seriously, and induce him by his
Power, wherein he excels him, if he find
it necessary, that K. <hi>William</hi> would remit
his Rancour against <hi>Iohn</hi> Arch-bishop of
St. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
                  </q> What can be inferred from
these words, but that the King of <hi>England</hi>
should by the Prerogative of his Dignity
and Arms compel <hi>William</hi> to obey the Pope,
because he would not do it otherwise? How
often has that been practis'd by Popes, that
while one King refuses to obey, they require
and implore the Help and Assistance of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
How frequently does this fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the German Princes? Of whom, if
any one refuse to obey the Decree of the
Imperial Chamber, the next Prince is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to take Arms, and compel him to
obey: Yet one of them is not superiour to
another. These things I mention only, that
all Men may understand upon what vain and
frivolous Arguments our Neighbours have
built this fictitious Homage: There was a
far other Event of the Friendship betwixt
K. <hi>Iohn</hi> and K. <hi>William,</hi> than there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and <hi>Richard,</hi> they being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:52199:190"/>
unlike in their Temper: For when K.
<hi>Iohn</hi> was for sometime taken up in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions
beyond Sea, that he might lay the
Storm which he was afraid of behind him, he
did so elude K. <hi>William</hi> by his fair Speeches,
Fictions, and repeated Promises, that it had
certainly issued in War, if <hi>William</hi> had not
been prevented by Death. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi>
and <hi>Hoveden,</hi> have recorded these delatory
Answers, which were fram'd by K. <hi>Iohn</hi>
while he abus'd the Plain heartedness of the
King of <hi>Scots:</hi> for sometimes he obtain'd a
Delay for six Months, sometimes till his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from beyond Sea, and sometimes till he
could call the States together that he might
not do any thing without their Advice:
And <hi>William</hi> did thereupon promise to be a
peaceable Neighbour, and keep his Subjects
from stirring. Nor will I deny but <hi>William</hi>
did Homage to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and also upon the
Cross of <hi>Hubert</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
in the Presence of many others, for the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
which he held in <hi>England;</hi> but that he
did the same for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is
absolutely false. The Form of that Homage,
and all the rest, is extant in <hi>Hoveden;</hi> where
there's no mention that the same was for
<hi>Scotland.</hi> Nay, <hi>Hoveden</hi> says expresly, that
<hi>William</hi> swore Fealty to him against all Men,
with a <hi>Salvo jure suo;</hi> that is, reserving his
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:52199:191"/>
own Royal Prerogative. But there occur
two things in <hi>Iohn,</hi> which pluck up the Roots
of this Homage: One is, that when K. <hi>Iohn</hi>
had made himself a Vassal, nay a Farmer to
the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and subjected himself and
his Heirs, and Kingdom and Lands, by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Bond of Fealty and Allegiance, he
expresly mentions those Lands, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
to pay 700 Marks annually for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and if <hi>Scotland</hi> had been
then subject unto him, why did he not add
something for the Tribute of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as
<hi>Holinshed</hi> did formerly alledg in the Matter
of <hi>Peter-pence?</hi> But K. <hi>Iohn</hi> was neither so
impudent as to promise it, nor <hi>Pandulphus</hi>
the Pope's Legate, such a Fool as to accept
of it. The other is, that when K. <hi>Iohn</hi> lay
under the Infamy of his Nephew's Death,
and all the Crimes which could be said or
thought of any Man, which rendred him
odious to his own Subjects and others, the
English Nobility conspir'd together for the
Choice of a new King; to whom assented
<hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> as one of the Peers
of <hi>England. Lewis,</hi> Son to <hi>Philip</hi> King of
<hi>France,</hi> had married <hi>Bertha</hi> Daughter of
<hi>Philippa</hi> Queen of <hi>Castile,</hi> and Sister to that
same K. <hi>Iohn;</hi> to whom <hi>Iohn</hi> being ejected,
and <hi>Arthur</hi> and his Sister being dead, the
Right of Succession to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:52199:191"/>
did belong: But when <hi>Lewis</hi> her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
arriv'd in <hi>England</hi> with Forces to seize
the Crown in his Wife's Right, the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>England</hi> swore Fealty to him as King
of <hi>England,</hi> and their Liege-Lord: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
others, <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi>
did also swear Fealty to him for the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which he held in <hi>England.</hi> The Form of
that Fealty is also extant in <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi>
whose words are these: <q>In the Month of
<hi>Angust, Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> came to
<hi>Dover</hi> with a Great Army (for fear of K.
<hi>Iohn)</hi> to <hi>Lewis,</hi> and did him Homage for
what he held in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q> Don't you see
here, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> if you see any thing,
what the Form of this Homage was which
the King of <hi>Scots</hi> paid to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
And therefore what you advance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Homage for the Kingdom of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> are the Imaginations of a vain and
impudent Man. Nor can you produce or
say any thing in Commendation of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of those Comments of your's, as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
speak; and those things do so much the
more injure your Fame, if you have any, as
the Falshood of your Assertion is to be
clearly demonstrated, even by the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of English Historians.</p>

his Assertion: For how often did <hi>Henry</hi> II.

And as for K. <hi>Iohn,</hi> he never wrote to <hi>`Philip</hi>
but under the Title of his Lord; nay, he
receiv'd the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to be held
of him, during his Brother <hi>Richard</hi>'s being
detain'd Prisoner in <hi>Germany;</hi> a mutual
Oath of Lord and Client having past betwixt
them: and when he succeeded to <hi>Richard</hi>
afterwards, was despoil'd of his Provinces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Sea by the French King, and being also
in hazard of losing <hi>England,</hi> he submitted
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:52199:192"/>
himself and his Kingdom, his Heirs, and all
his Lands, <hi>viz. England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the
Pope to be held of him, under an annual
Tribute, or Farm, of 1000 Marks; which
was also put in Execution: For the Pope
having lanc'd his Thunder-bolts with Curses
and Excommunications, against the King of
<hi>France</hi> and the Barons, he deterr'd them from
their Purpose of dethroning K. <hi>Iohn;</hi> but
Seditions and Conspiracies growing greater
and greater against him every day, he sent
Ambassadors to Admiral <hi>Murmelin,</hi> then the
most powerful of all the Saracen Princes,
signifying (which are <hi>Matthew Paris</hi>'s own
words) that he surrendred himself and his
Kingdom to him, to be held under an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Tribute if he thought good; that he
would also abandon the Christian Religion,
which he esteemed vain, and faithfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to that of <hi>Mahomet</hi> for time to come.
Who were the Ambassadors, and what was
the Effect of the Embassy, is to be seen in
<hi>Matthew Paris.</hi> I am really struck with
Horror, as relating those things; for his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
formerly mentioned, to the Pope,
is but Childrens Play in comparison of this
Surrender. And if the English could have
found any such thing against any of our
Kings, what a Tragical Business would they
have made of it long e're now?</p>

                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:52199:193"/>You affirm, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi> that at the

by the Encouragement of their
Preachers, as those who were to fight in a
just Cause for the defence of their Country,
they despis'd Death; and thereupon <hi>Henry</hi>
went off without doing any thing. Now if
any Man, who had no Prejudice against, non

Peace by means of his Brother <hi>Richard,</hi>

but finding it impossible to put it in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

The Tenor of this Transaction betwixt <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
III. and <hi>Alexander</hi> II. is recorded both by
<hi>Westminster</hi> and <hi>Paris;</hi> wherein there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

any Homage for <hi>Scotland:</hi> Nor does <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

owns the King of <hi>England</hi> as his
Lord: And what wonder, when in reality
he was so for the four Provinces above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned?
And so in all those Transactions or
Indentures which were betwixt the Kings of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and most of which are
to be found in <hi>Hoveden, Paris,</hi> and others,
<hi>Henry</hi> II. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> III. own the
French King to be their Lord: Nay, <hi>Edward</hi>

in this Transaction, <hi>Alexander</hi> did that which

the Kings having agreed betwixt themselves
that this Transaction should be inserted in

thereby submit to the Pope's Jurisdiction in
this Matter; which <hi>Henry</hi> would never have
endured, if he had been his Liege-Lord:

until the Tumults, which were then very

does this infer either Military Wardship, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
or Homage? It cannot certainly

the Children of Princes cannot be educated

in your own History, to assert that

was not of age to perform it; at least you
craftily dissemble as if you had not read that

And therefore I will oppose to you
the very words of <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> lest I
should seem to have contrived any thing of
my own Head<note n="*" place="margin">Matthew Paris <hi>in</hi> Hen. III.</note>. <q>The King of <hi>Scots</hi> in

of his Lord the King of <hi>England,</hi> in the

that which was extorted from K. <hi>William</hi>
during his Captivity; of which I have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before. Or if they have any Author, why
are they afraid to name him? For as to all
the former Citations, I have clearly refuted
them already; but in this Performance of
Homage, <hi>Alexander</hi> did right in performing
it for the Lands which he held in <hi>England,</hi>
but refus'd it for <hi>Scotland</hi> as he ought indeed
to have done. I have Authors who say that
he added, that <hi>he came into</hi> England <hi>under

               <p>You say that <hi>Henry</hi> being troubled with
Seditions in his own Kingdom, obtain'd 5000,
our Writers say 10000, Scots; most part of
whom perished in that War, fighting stoutly
for <hi>Henry</hi> against <hi>Simon Montfort,</hi> and the
rest of the English Barons. But <hi>Alexander</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now acquainted with the English Tricks,
and that they were accustomed to put a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent
Interpretation upon those Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as a Service that was due to them, he
obtain'd Letters from his Father-in-Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they march'd from <hi>Scotland, that they were
not granted as due by Military Service, but
meerly upon the account of Benevolence and
Friendship.</hi> And the like was done by <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
in relation to <hi>Edward</hi> 1. when he sent
him Auxiliaries to subdue <hi>Wales:</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

which <hi>Alexander</hi> ow'd as Beneficiary for the

not one word that it was for the Kingdom of

did not come thither till he had first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
it in Writing, that he did not come, as
being oblig'd thereunto, by Service, but only
out of Good-will and Friendship. For the

the Fire: And as in this <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

his Crast, to acknowledg him for their Lord,
which they did constantly refuse, saying,
They would receive none as such, but one
born in <hi>Wales,</hi> and who spoke that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
Yet at last after many Difficulties,
they allow'd <hi>Edward</hi> the Power of naming
him, having taken an Oath, that they would
obey, if he nam'd such an One: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Edward</hi> says, Yea verily, I will give you
a Welch Lord and Prince, one born in
<hi>Wales,</hi> altogether ignorant of the English
Tongue, and who knows not how to speak
any thing else than Welch, and then nam'd
his Son. But although the Welch did plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive that they were cheated, yet
they look'd upon themselves as bound by
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:52199:201"/>
their Oath, and from that time forward the
eldest Son of <hi>England</hi> hath been always
call'd Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> He attaqu'd the
Scots with the same Craft and Cunning, but
only that he did it also in Arms, that he
might usurp the Soveraignty of <hi>Scotland</hi> to
himself; for when at first he seem'd unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to take the Arbitration upon him, as
being unequal to so great a Burden, but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
them that he would no less preserve
the Dignity of the Scotish Nation firm and
inviolable than his own: First, he bound
them all by an Oath, to acquiesce in his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and demanded, that all Castles, Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and fortified Places should be delivered
into his Custody, under pretence, that the
stubborn opposite Parties would not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
obey, unless he could force them to it;
therefore how great the Simplicity, or rather
the Madness of our Countrymen was, to
deliver themselves thus, bound up in Chains,
into the Hands of any Enemy, let the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Reader judg. But <hi>Edward</hi> march'd to
the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to fight as <hi>Liege
Lord,</hi> says <hi>Walsingham:</hi> but I pray you, Mr.
<hi>Walsingham,</hi> who expected War from him,
certainly not the Scots, who had committed
their greatest Affairs to his Arbitration; and
who had then neither King, General, nor
Army, as fearing no Enemy, and being sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:52199:202"/>
by him, came with their usual Trains,
but without Arms; and there when they
expected no such thing, they found <hi>Edward</hi>
upon his Throne, giving himself out for
<hi>Liege Lord of Scotland,</hi> that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Sentence as such, and that the Cause
could not be legally determin'd otherwise
than before the Liege Lord. The Scots
were struck silent with Astonishment, and
found themselves surrounded on all Hands
with the English Soldiery; so that <hi>Edward</hi>
goes on, alledging, that he did not demand
any new thing, but only the Right of his
Predecessors, protesting, that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send
the Prerogative of his Crown with
his Blood: and that he might the more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswade them of this, he made all the
Monasteries of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi>
to be search'd, that he might know what
his Right was on that Head. These are <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham</hi>'s
Words<note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. 1290.</note>, and it was found, says
he, in the Chronicles of <hi>Marianus Scotus,

on them. And first, King <hi>Edward,</hi> that he
might not be wanting in number of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:52199:202"/>

did never yet see the Light for any
thing that we know: Nor does <hi>Balaeus</hi> in
his Catalogue of <hi>British</hi> Writers make any
mention of him; and therefore as Logicians
say, <hi>de non ente nullum est Iudicium,</hi> we can
form no Judgment of that which has no
Being. <hi>Marianus Scotus</hi> has no such thing,
nor yet <hi>Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for none of those Authors did ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to writing, that those Kings were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
by <hi>Edward</hi> the Elder; they only say,
that <hi>Cumberland</hi> was given to the King of
<hi>Scots</hi> by <hi>Edward,</hi> to be held of him that he
might suppress the Danish Tumults, and
keep the disorderly People in their Duty.
Nor if they had writ so, could they prejudg
our Cause, for those three, <hi>Malmsbury, Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
and <hi>Huntington</hi> were late Writers, and
flourish'd at the same Time with King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
and wrote in the Time of <hi>Henry,</hi> or
a little before, and therefore I submit it to
the Judgment of the candid Reader. If the
King of <hi>England</hi> had brought those three
Men along with him, that he might have
made use of their Evidence, either for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Dignity of their King or Country,
or this Superiority, what just Judg would
have admitted them, or have given Credit
to them though they had been upon Oath?
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:52199:203"/>
And at last, if they had said, that the Scots
were subdued, what would have followed
thence? For how often have subdued Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
recovered their Courage; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repell'd, but subdued the Conquerors?
And therefore this first Proof being destitute
of all its Sinews, falls to the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walsingham</hi> adds, that the same <hi>Edward</hi> was
chosen as Lord and Patron by the Kings of
<hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> but we must take
notice that the place is corrupted: for <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
says only, that he was chosen for

he was chosen as Lord and Father to
sustain the Impresssions of the Danes, that
therefore he was constituted Liege-Lord of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> for many are saluted as Lords, and
chosen for Fathers or Lords, who cannot
pretend however to any Right but that

the Electors. Neither is it true that there

League against the Danes. But that <hi>Edgar</hi>
overcame <hi>Rivadus,</hi> Son to <hi>Alpin</hi> King of
<hi>Scots,</hi> is not only void of all Testimony, but
Reason: For besides that there was never
any King of <hi>Scots</hi> of that Name, his suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Father <hi>Alpin</hi> was dead 200 Years before
him, and by that same Authority he is call'd
King of <hi>Denmark, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi>
though there be no Writer who mentions
that ever he did enter into any of them.
Nor did ever <hi>Malcolm</hi> receive the Kingdom
of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be held in Fee of <hi>Edward:</hi>
Nor is there any English Historian who says
so; but they do only make mention, that
the Auxiliary Forces of <hi>Northumberland</hi> came
thither under their General Earl <hi>Sivard:</hi> on
whose Assistance <hi>Malcolm</hi> having relied, he
deprived <hi>Mackbeth</hi> the Tyrant, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded

                  <hi>Malcolm</hi> his Sister's Son in the Recovery of

except he read them, that such ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Instances should be brought as
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:52199:204"/>
dence? That <hi>Malcolm</hi> was overcome both
by the Conqueror and <hi>Rufus,</hi> is not to be
found any where, but they were both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to return Home, after the Conclusion
of a disadvantageous Peace, upon <hi>Malcolm</hi>'s
coming against them with an Army. As to
<hi>Malcolm</hi>'s two Sons, the Bastard was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for bringing English Auxiliary Forces
with him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the English
were forc'd to retire; the other of them did
Homage, but not for the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
If <hi>Alexander</hi> succeeded his Brother
<hi>Edgar,</hi> with the Consent of <hi>Henry</hi> the first,
what Wonder! for <hi>Henry</hi>'s Wife was his
Sister: but that <hi>David</hi> did Homage to <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>
is contrary to the Credit of all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
who do plainly assert, that <hi>David</hi>
could never be induc'd to perform Homage
to <hi>Stephen,</hi> because he had oblig'd himself to
be true to <hi>Maud</hi> beforehand. As to <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
and <hi>Alexander,</hi> we have lately spoken;
Homage was certainly due to the King of
<hi>England,</hi> nor was it unusual to have it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd:
but what's the Difference betwixt
this in our Kings, and those of <hi>England,</hi> or
wherein was the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> different
from that of <hi>England?</hi> for the Conqueror
and his Son <hi>Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the first, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the second, <hi>Richard, Iohn, Henry</hi> the

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:52199:204"/>
did all of them swear Homage and Fealty to
the King of <hi>France,</hi> as their Liege Lord,
and yet they did not acknowledg him as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let's see what the Scots answered to
these Proofs brought by <hi>Edward.</hi> The Scots
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y they answered, that they knew nothing
of this Superiority; nor could they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an Head, answer to such things, insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating,
and that not obscurely, that they ow'd
no such Homage, and that if they had had a
Head or King at that Time, that <hi>Edward</hi>
would not have demanded that Superiority:
The Scots must needs have been Stones or
Toad-stools, or something yet more stupid,
if they did not know their Lord, of whom
they held their Lands;
<q>
                     <l>Non obtusa adeo gestabant pectora Scoti;</l>
                     <l>Nec tam aversus equis nostro Sol jungit ab Orbe.</l>
                  </q>
Such gross Ignorance is not to born with in
the most savage Barbarians, for even the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Gothland, Island</hi> and <hi>Finland,</hi>
know their Lord, and pay their annual Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
very willingly. But <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander,</hi>
is very much in the right, the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives</hi>
contending with the <hi>Spartans</hi> about the
Boundaries of their Lands, and affirming,
that their Arguments were stronger than
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:52199:205"/>
those of the <hi>Spartans; Lysander</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi>
General showing them a Sword, said, he
that holds this shall have the best in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
about the Boundaries of the Lands,
and <hi>Edward</hi> followed his Example in this
Controversy: But say our Neighbours, there
are Confessions of some of the <hi>Scots,</hi> recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing
the King of <hi>England</hi> as Liege Lord
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Forms of which Confessions
being drawn up in French, are exhibited
both by <hi>Westminster</hi> and <hi>Walsingham.</hi> If
what <hi>Walsingham</hi> and <hi>Westminster</hi> relate be
true, this Confession was extrorted from the
Scots by Violence, being surrounded with
armed Men who would have cut their
Throats if they had not done it: But there
are very few Scots there mentioned, for <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
Earl of <hi>Holland, Baliol,</hi> and <hi>Hastings</hi>
of <hi>Bessy,</hi> who sign'd instead of his Father,
were not Scots but Englishmen; and as for
<hi>Bruce,</hi> it is evidently false, for he might
have made such a Confession more to his
Advantage elsewhere: Nor are there three
Scotsmen in that Charter, neither did they
at that time understand the French Tongue;
so that whatever was offered to them, they
subscrib'd so they might escape safe. By
these Methods did <hi>Edward</hi> proceed to Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
but finding the Pretensions of two
of the Competitors to overballance all the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:52199:205"/>
rest, he call'd <hi>Bruce</hi> apart, and promises to
make him King if he would acknowledg him
for Liege-Lord; but <hi>Bruce</hi> answered mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimously,
that the Kingdom which he had
receiv'd free from his Ancestors, he would
never inslave nor render subject to another.
<hi>Edward</hi> being amaz'd with this fierce and
resolute Answer, calls upon <hi>Baliol,</hi> and offers
the same Condition to him, which, he being
an ambitious Man thirsting after the Crown,
and thinking he had made a good Bargain
if he could purchase a Throne at any Rate,
did willingly embrace. In the mean time
King <hi>Edward</hi> dissembling this under-hand
Transaction, pretended that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
the Matter according to the Opinions
of the best Lawyers of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi>
and propounds the Case thus. A certain
King holding his Kingdom from another
King in Fee, and neither being accustomed
to be Crown'd nor Anointed, but only
plac'd in a certain Chair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's truly
wonderful how he could propose the Case
thus, for here he takes the thing in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
for granted that the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was a Fee of <hi>England,</hi> which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much as once heard of before that
time: but 'tis yet more strange, that he should
say, that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> did neither use
to be Anointed nor Crown'd; when he
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:52199:206"/>
himself ordered all <hi>Baliol</hi>'s Equipage to be
search'd as he was hastning through <hi>England</hi>
to <hi>France,</hi> and finding therein the Crown
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he took it from him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
it to St. <hi>Thomas</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Walsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham in Edw. I.</note>. But to return
to <hi>Balibl</hi> whom <hi>Edward</hi> preferr'd, having
rejected the rest, he declar'd him King, and
receiv'd Homage from him according to the
Terms of the Agreement before-mention'd,
and in such Form as he thought most suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his Affairs, and which he did dictate
to <hi>Baliol,</hi> that new King refusing nothing;
for <hi>Baliol</hi> was really an Englishman and great
Grandchild to that <hi>Bernard,</hi> who had the
Glory of taking <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> by
an Ambush, as I mark'd before out of <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and was rewarded with many Lands in
<hi>England</hi> upon that Account: So that in this
I dissent from my Countrymen, who say, he
was a <hi>Norman,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Harcourt:</hi> It
may be he had some Possessions in <hi>Normandy,</hi>
for his Predecessors came thence with the
Conqueror. But <hi>Baliol</hi> being thus decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
King, he did not only pay the Price of
the Sentence agreed upon before, but also
renounced all his Right to <hi>Cumberland, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>
and <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> and only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<hi>Huntington,</hi> with the Consent of the
King of <hi>England,</hi> who knew that he could
easily divest him of that at any Time: nor is
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:52199:206"/>
it to be wondered at, that an English Man
and a Subject of <hi>England,</hi> should procure
the Advantage of his Lord, especially when
by his means he was made capable of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Crown, which he did so much
long for, according to that of the Poet,

               <p>But the English will say, that <hi>Edward</hi>
pronounc'd a very just Sentence, in
adjudging the Succession of the Crown of
<hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Margaret,</hi> eldest Daughter to

and her Off-spring; for there's no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
who does not prefer the First-born to
the second, in <hi>Individual Fees,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
the Off-spring of the First, to the
Off-spring of the Second: although indeed
most men think that this Sentence of King
<hi>Edward</hi>'s was according to Law, yet because
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:52199:207"/>
of his being corrupted, and receiving a
Reward for his Sentence, he ought not to
have been Judg; but if the Matter be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
canvass'd, perhaps it will be found
that this Sentence was not pronounc'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Equity neither: for besides the
other Reasons brought by our Countrymen,
and the Custom of the Kingdom then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in Judgment, that in the Off-spring of
diverse Sisters, the first Male is prefer'd, and
the Case of the Count of <hi>Nivern</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> for the County of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> approv'd by all the Parliaments of
<hi>France,</hi> and especially the Senate of <hi>Paris;</hi>
I appeal them also to the Feudal Law it self,
which was at that time tenaciously observ'd
by the Noblest Kingdoms in <hi>Europe.</hi> I shall
here cite one Text, which agrees so well to
this our Hypothesis, that nothing can be
more like: The words of the Text are
these, <hi>The like if any Man be invested in a
Fee, so that it descend upon Women, and leave
only two Daughters, of which the one has a
Son, and the other a Daughter, whether after
their Death the Male ought only to have the
Fee; according to Gerard, the Male only:
Obertus on the contrary: And on the other
Hand if he have Sons.</hi> That we may adapt
this Text to our Hypothesis, <hi>David</hi> Earl of
<hi>Huntington</hi> and <hi>Chester,</hi> to whom as the next
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:52199:207"/>
of the Paternal Line, the Right to the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (the whole Off-spring
of his Brother <hi>William</hi> being extinguish'd)
and its Succession devolv'd, of which Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
a Woman and those who descend
from her are as capable as a Male. He left
two Daughters, <hi>Margaret</hi> the eldest, who
married <hi>Alan</hi> Earl of <hi>Galloway,</hi> of which
Marriage was born <hi>Dornagilla</hi> Mother to
<hi>Iohn Baliol,</hi> afterwards King; the other was
<hi>Isabel,</hi> married to <hi>Robert Earl</hi> of <hi>Carick,</hi> of
which Marriage was born <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to King <hi>Robert</hi> the first. The Question
is, whether <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> though born of the
second Daughter, yet the first Male, or <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagilla</hi>
Grandchild by the first born Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is to be preferr'd in the Succession to
the Crown, which admits of no Division:
In this Question the two great Lights of the
Feudal Law, <hi>Gerard</hi> and <hi>Obert</hi> are oppos'd
to one another; but the Opinion of <hi>Gerard,</hi>
that the first Male is to be preferred, is not
only confirm'd by other Places, as well of
the Civil as Feudal Law, but also by the
Suffrages of all the Interpreters. <hi>Baldus
Alvaroltus</hi> the President, and the Moderns
<hi>Hottomannus Duarenus, Baro, Conerus</hi> and
<hi>Cujacius;</hi> nay, and <hi>Hortensius</hi> himself does
in other Places, approve of the Opinion of
<hi>Gerard</hi> as the truest: Nor is there any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

to doubt, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cause the Text does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
whether this Son be born of the eldest
or second Daughter; for if this Son had been
born of the eldest Daughter, there had been
no place for doubting. But as to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
the Reader may see more in my second
Book <hi>de Feudis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is this Decision without a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the Succession of the English Crown:
For <hi>Henry</hi> I. his Male Issue being dead, and
having a Grand-son, afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> II. by
<hi>Maud</hi> his Daughter, who was married to
<hi>Geffrey Plantagenot</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> he was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
how to secure the Succession of the
Crown to them, and made all the States of
<hi>England</hi> swear Fealty to them as those who
were to reign immediately after him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
he being dead, <hi>Stephen,</hi> Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to the Conqueror by a Daughter, took
the Crown. Nor is it likely that the English
would have receiv'd him contrary to their
Oaths, except the Law had been for him:
For <hi>Henry</hi> II. Son to <hi>Maud,</hi> having the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
by a Woman, and <hi>Stephen</hi> having the
same, he affirm'd himself to be first in the
Succession, because he was the first Male,
though descending from a Woman: nay, he
urg'd that if <hi>Maud</hi> her self had been alive,
he ought to be preferr'd to her, as being the
first born Male, and by consequence his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:52199:208"/>
ought to be preferr'd to <hi>Henry</hi> II.
This Matter was debated a long time in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
yet <hi>Stephen</hi> was never accounted an
Usurper or Tyrant, but look'd upon as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Heir and King: Nor were ever his Laws
r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>scinded by succeeding Kings, as those of
one who had no lawful Authority. Nay,
that which is more, at the Agreement betwixt
Him and <hi>Henry</hi> II. his own Son <hi>Eustace</hi> being
dead, he adopted <hi>Henry</hi> II. that so he might
derive the Right of Succession from his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Which he would never have done, had
he been look'd upon as a Tyrant or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
King: And in most places of <hi>Hoveden</hi> it
appears, that the first Male descending from
a Female Line, is judg'd to have the best
Right. For the Antients were of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that a Male in the same Degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity
was always to be preferred: and
thus a Brother is preferred to all the Sisters,
and so amongst Cousins (for the Case of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
is the same) the first Male was preferred
in the Succession to the Grand-father, to a
Woman, though begotten by the eldest Son.
But the Case is not the same in Brothers; for
the first born excludes the younger: but in
Women the Case is the same; for they all
succeed alike, none of them being preferred
to one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:52199:209"/>This is sufficient to be taken notice of at
present, seeing I know that there were then
other Rules of Judging: for, as it appears
by <hi>Bodinus,</hi> it was customary at that time in
most places, that the eldest Son dying before
the Father, and leaving a Son behind him,
the second Brother was preferred to the
Grand-child in the Succession to his Father;
and he instances in Cases having been deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
thus. Then let others think as they
please, (for I offer Violence to no Man's
Judgment) it's my Opinion that, both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Rules of the Feudal Law, and
the Custom of the Country, which <hi>Edward</hi>
ought to have observ'd, he gave a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
Sentence: Which was not to be expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any otherwise than by the Lives of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes,
as the Event verified.</p>

first, they chid <hi>Baliol</hi> severely, for rendring
the Kingdom subject to an Enemy, which he
had received free from his Ancestors: but
he promising to be afterwards govern'd by
the Peers, took Arms with all Expedition
against <hi>Edward's</hi> return from <hi>France;</hi> and
when at his coming Home, he redemanded
Homage from <hi>Baliol, Walsingham, Polidore</hi>
and <hi>Holinshed</hi> say, the Scots answered, that
they were born Free, were subject to none
but their own King; nor would they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
any other Soveraign, but their
own Prince. <hi>Edward</hi> being incensed, says
<hi>Polidore,</hi> did not only deprive <hi>Baliol</hi> of the
Earldom of <hi>Huntington</hi> for his Ingratitude,
but led a great Army against the Scots, and
having killed many thousands, took <hi>Berwick</hi>
by Storm; <hi>Walsingham</hi> says, that there were
60000 slain there: At <hi>Dumbar</hi> he routed all
the Scots Forces under <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Bruce</hi> took part with the English, as he
did a long time after, in hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s that the King
of <hi>England</hi> would eject <hi>Baliol,</hi> and set him
upon the Throne; for so <hi>Edward</hi> had
promised him under-hand after he began
to hate <hi>Baliol,</hi> that he might thereby draw
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:52199:211"/>
him over to his side. So that <hi>Baliol's</hi> Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
being quite broke, because he found
himself unable to maintain such a War, being
despis'd by his Subjects, and contemn'd by his
Adversaries, he resign'd the Kingdom into
the Hands of <hi>Edward,</hi> having received in
lieu thereof some Lands in <hi>Normandy,</hi> where
he might live the rest of his Days. But I would
pray the kind Reader to have a little Patience
and Attention, while I beat the Assertors of
this Homage with their own Weapons.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Edward</hi> was the first who establish'd
the Homage in a King of his own Chusing
and Appointment, nay his own Liege-man
and Subject. Nor is it any wonder that this
cowardly Man, who was altogether unfit
for Government, and yet blinded with an
Ambition to reign, and above all being an
English-man, did this Homage in favour of
his Soveraign. And though we should grant
what they will never be able to make out by
any probable Argument, that the Kingdom
of <hi>Scotland</hi> was a Fee-Liege of <hi>England,</hi> and
that the King of <hi>England</hi> had before that
time been Liege-Lord of <hi>Scotland;</hi> yet I
will make it plainly appear, that that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and Superiority was destroyed by <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
Then the King of <hi>England</hi> was, as they
say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Superiour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Baliol</hi> his
Vassal for the same, if the Gods will have it
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:52199:211"/>
so. But <hi>Baliol,</hi> who was a cowardly Man,
being deserted by his Subjects, and unable
to maintain the War, he came to the King
of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Brechin,</hi> and resign'd all the
Right which he had to the Crown of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
with the Homage of his Scots, into the
Hands of <hi>Edward</hi> his Lord, as Liege Lord,
which is recorded by all the Writers of both
Nations. This Resignation being made, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
was no more Superior or Liege Lord of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> but Lord-Proprietor of all <hi>Scotland,</hi>
no less than he was of <hi>England;</hi> for then there
was no Vassal for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland:</hi>
but the Property was consolidate with the
Superiority, which Consolidation Lawyers
call, <hi>Confusio Dominii utilis cum directo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> and
so <hi>Edward</hi> himself says, that by this Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
he was legally constituted Possessor
of the full Dominion, that all the Scots
were his Subjects, and perform'd Fealty and
Homage to him as to their immediate Lord:
and therefore if by this Resignation the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
and profitable Dominion be conjoin'd
and consolidated with the Superiority, it
follows of necessity, that the Superiority is
extinguish'd, for there can be no Superior
or Lord, where there is not a <hi>Vassal or Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior;</hi>
for these are Correlate, and if one be
wanting, the other must of necessity fall.
And therefore what is principally urg'd for
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:52199:212"/>
the Confirmation of this Homage by our
Neighbours, is the chief thing that subverts
it; and if they confess that to have been a
true and lawful Resignation, it is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to confess any Superiority or Property
afterwards, except they can make it appear,
that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> was given in
Fee <hi>de novo,</hi> by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> which
no Man who hath not declared open War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Truth, will as I believe attempt:
for there's no English-man who can for shame
assert this Homage, or affirm, that <hi>Scotland</hi>
was given after that to be held in Fee of
<hi>England;</hi> nor is it credible that the King of
<hi>England</hi> would so easily part with it, who
had so often sought an opportunity to be
possess'd of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and therefore it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by their own proper Confession, that
the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> from that time, which is
now three hundred Years, have not been Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> nor owed them
any Allegiance or Homage. But if our
Neighbours ask by what Right then do our
Kings possess <hi>Scotland</hi> at this time, I answer,
by one much better than the English possess
<hi>England;</hi> but another Place is more proper
for this Controversy: It is sufficient now
that I have evinced, that this commentiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Superiority was overturn'd by this Act
of <hi>Edward</hi> the first's, which is supposed
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:52199:212"/>
to have promoted it most of all.</p>
               <p>They did not cease from Arms after the
Resignation by <hi>Baliol;</hi> for when the Scots
did assert that that Resignation was void
and frivolous, they took Arms with great
Expedition, and routed the English in
many small and some great Battels, tho the
English Writers do only take notice of two,
one at <hi>Sterlin</hi> Bridg, where half the English
Army, with <hi>Hugh Cressingham</hi> their General
was slain, and the other at <hi>Roslin,</hi> where under
the Conduct of <hi>Simon Fraser</hi> their General
8000 Scots scarcely half armed, did in one
Day rout three English Armies, whereof
each did at least consist of ten thousand Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
Souldiers; for <hi>Ralph Confrey</hi> who had
30000 English under his Command, for fear
that he should want Provisions and Forage,
divided his Army into three Parts, yet so as
they might not be far asunder, but help one
another as occasion requir'd. But <hi>Fraser</hi>
watching for an Opportunitiy, assoon as he
saw their Forces divided into three Bodies,
he attaqu'd them one by one, and in the
space of one Day, did almost totally cut
them off; and so the English who did now
promise themselves sure footing in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
were all thrown out, and their bordering
Countries expos'd to the Ravages and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastations
of the Scots. <hi>Edward</hi> being
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:52199:213"/>
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at these Successes of our Countrymen,
he assembled not only the whole Strength of
<hi>England,</hi> but also that of the Provinces
which he did then command beyond-Sea,
and march'd into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
there, most of the Nobility of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
joined him, and amongst others <hi>Bruce</hi>
with his Forces, which did mightily encrease
his Army. But the Scots being nothing ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by such numerous Forces, tho at the
same time deserted by most of the chief No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
they rais'd an Army, and being lifted
up by their former Victories, they prepar'd
for Battel in a plain Ground call'd <hi>Falkirk;</hi>
but Ambition prov'd their Destruction, and,
as it is said of <hi>Eris,</hi> threw in an Apple of
Contention amongst them, by which <hi>Troy</hi>
was afterwards consumed, because she was
not invited to the Marriage of <hi>Peleus</hi> and
<hi>Thetis.</hi> The Scots Army did not exceed
30000 Men, under the Command of three
Generals, <hi>Iohn Cummin</hi> at that time the most
powerful of the Scots Nobility, <hi>Iohn Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
and <hi>William Wallace:</hi> But a fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
happen'd amongst them about lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Van against the English, for that's
the Post of greatest Honour amongst us:
<hi>Cummin</hi> claimed it as his due, nor would
<hi>Steward</hi> yield to him in Dignity, and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi>
said it was his Right, and due to his
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:52199:213"/>
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as Viceroy. Hence rose Discord and
Factions in the Army, and <hi>Cummin</hi> perceiving
that the Souldiery favoured the other two
more than him, he went off with all his
Forces, for the rest suspected him as a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of the English; nor was it without
ground, for <hi>Westminster</hi> and <hi>Walsingham</hi>
do both of them exhibit the Form of the
Oath which he swore to be true to <hi>Edward</hi>
before that time; and by this his Family
which was then, as I have already said, the
greatest and most potent of any in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
was so brought under, that the name of
<hi>Cummin</hi> is now very rare in <hi>Scotland.</hi> As to
the other two, <hi>Steward</hi> and <hi>Wallace,</hi> the first
claimed the leading of the Vanguard because
of his Nobility, and the latter demanded it
because of his Valour and the Suffrage of the
People: <hi>Steward</hi> being enrag'd at it, upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Wallace</hi> with the Fable of <hi>Aesop</hi> or <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi>'s
little Raven, which did so exasperate
<hi>Wallace,</hi> that not being able to master his
Passion, he did also march off with all his
Forces; the only Blot that can be charged
on him during the whole Course of his Life,
that he should not have sacrific'd the Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Injury done to himself, to that
of his Country at such a critical Juncture:
but in all other respects, he may be compar'd
to the Antient Hero's, either for
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:52199:214"/>
Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Body or Mind. <hi>Steward</hi> being left
alone in the Field, did (lest he should seem
to be fiercer in Words than Deeds) give
Battel to the <hi>English</hi> with a great deal of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
tho he had but one third part of his
Army; but that which proved most fatal to
him, was his engaging on plain Ground,
and not being aware of <hi>Bruce,</hi> who fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Reer; so that being encompass'd with
a multitude of Horse and Foot, he was cut
off with most of his Men. <hi>Bruce</hi> is branded
with the Infamy of this Battel, for having
brought great Forces into the Field against
his own Countrymen, and fought with too
much Bravery in favour of King <hi>Edward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have insisted the more upon the Event
of this Fight, because the English please
themselves too much with the Relation of
it, and give out, that above 60000 Scots
were slain in this Action, whereas they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
did not lose above thirty Men: <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
says, there were 200000 Scots in
this Army; <hi>Wals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ngham</hi> does not pitch upon
any Number, but says, it was an horrible
Battel, the whole Scots Army being destroy'd
by the English Cavalry. However that is,
it is certain that the Battel was great, and
that abundance of Scots fell therein: but
though they were broken by this Battel,
they did not abandon their Cause; for
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:52199:214"/>
                  <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace's</hi> Anger being asswaged, he brought back
his Forces into the Field; and although he
durst not give Battel to the numerous and
victorious English Army, yet following them
close, he did by falling on their Reer, and
cutting of the Straglers, so much pinch the
English Cavalry for want of Forage, that
<hi>Edward</hi> was forced to return into <hi>England;
Bruce</hi> followed him by reason of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
upon him, and requiring him
to fulfil his Promise, was rejected with Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain:
whereupon he began privily to
sound how the Scots stood affected to him,
and to solicite them to declare him Heir
to the Crown; but all of them being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of him, his business went on but slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at first.</p>

               <head type="sub">A sharp Epistle from Pope Boniface the 8th,
to King Edward about the Injustice of his
War against the Scots, and Edward's Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</head>
               <p>IN the mean time there happened a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
betwixt <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> and
<hi>Edward</hi> I. about the Right of this Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over <hi>Scotland:</hi> For when the Scots be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inferior in Arms, had recourse to the
Help and Assistance of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and had plainly instructed the Injuries done
to them by <hi>Edward, Boniface</hi> being mov'd
with their Intreaties and the Justice of their
Cause, wrote Letters to <hi>Edward,</hi> accusing
him of Injustice in undertaking of this War,
and threatning him with Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
if he did not desist from troubling the
Scots: But this Controversy being copied
both by <hi>Walsingham</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> I shall
go over the Heads of it in a few Words,
seeing by them the Decision of this whole
Controversy will be manifest; for the Pope
proves by very strong Arguments, that this
whole. War was unlawfully undertaken, and
that <hi>Edward</hi> did unjustly vex the Scots upon
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:52199:215"/>
the Account of that Superiority, which he
did falsly conceive he had a Right to over
their Kingdom. <hi>Walsingham,</hi> that he may
lessen this Authority of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>
does fabulously assert, that the Scots had
corrupted the Pope with Money, as if ever
the Scots had so much abounded therewith,
as to be able to out-bribe the English: But
pray let's hear what <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> has to
say for <hi>Scotland.</hi> First, he alledges, That
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> did not belong to
any other but the See of <hi>Rome</hi> that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, nor ever was a Fee of <hi>England,</hi> as
<hi>Edward</hi> alledged: He brings no Proof for
this Proposition as being Negative, and has
not only a manifest Presumption of Law,
seeing the Presumption is always reckoned
on the side of Liberty, but Notoriety and
perpetual Custom. But afterwards he proves
the Matter plainly by Deeds of <hi>Edward</hi>
himself, and <hi>Henry</hi> his Father: for when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
the third King of <hi>Scots</hi> sent Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Forces to <hi>Henry</hi> III. in his War with <hi>Simon
de Montefort,</hi> he demanded an express Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat,
that they should not be look'd upon as
sent on the Account of any Subjection or
Right; which <hi>Henry</hi> did also testify by his
Letters Patents, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>he had received
those Auxiliary Troops, not as any Assistance
any way due to him, but as a special Favour from
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:52199:216"/>
his Neighbour Prince.</hi> And certainly this
Argument of the Pope's, does utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Homage; for if <hi>Scotland</hi> had been
a Kingdom held by <hi>Edward's</hi> Bounty, he
might have demanded those Auxiliaries, not
as a Favour, but as a Debt: For the Vassal
is obliged to assist his Lord both in War
with his Military Force, and at Home with
his Counsel and Advice; for Favour and
Debt cannot agree, but the supposing of the
one, implies a Denial of the other: Nor
could <hi>Henry</hi> declare that <hi>Scotland</hi> owed him
no Service, in more express Terms, than by
desiring Assistance from the King of <hi>Scots</hi>
as a Favour.</p>
               <p>The third and a most powerful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
brought by the Pope, is from the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of <hi>Edward</hi> himself in his own Person:
for when <hi>Edward</hi> required the Presence of
his Neighbouring Monarch <hi>Alexander</hi> at his
Coronation by his Letters, the King of <hi>Scots</hi>
not being ignorant of the English Tricks,
refus'd it until <hi>Edward</hi> himself, did by his
Letters <hi>grant him a Gaveat, that his Presence
was not required as that whereunto he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
but only as a special Favour.</hi> Now what
can be said more plain or express against this
Homage, seeing the Vassal, as has been alread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
hinted, is always obliged to appear at
his Lord's Court when he is required?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:52199:216"/>The fourth Argument, and that which is
still harder upon <hi>Edward,</hi> is, that when the
King of <hi>Scots</hi> appeared before him in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to perform the usual Homage for <hi>Tyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l</hi>
and <hi>Penreth</hi> (which are both in <hi>England</hi>)
before he took the Oath, he did openly, and
in the Presence of a great many Persons, <hi>viva
Voce,</hi> declare, that he swore Fealty for the
Lands which he held in <hi>England,</hi> and not as K.
of <hi>Scotland:</hi> for he neither ow'd nor would
perform any Homage or Fealty to the King
of <hi>England,</hi> for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi>
and that <hi>Edward</hi> himself did then agree to
what was spoken, though nothing could be
said or thought more express for the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of this Homage.</p>
               <p>The fifth Argument which the Pope makes
use of against <hi>Edward,</hi> is stronger still: for
when <hi>Alexander</hi> died, leaving only a Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
by <hi>Edward</hi>'s Sister, who was his Wife,
behind him as Heiress of the Crown, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
did solicite a Marriage betwixt her
and his Son <hi>Edward,</hi> then Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi>
by all Methods imaginable; whereas <hi>had he
been Liege Lord of Scotland,</hi> the Wardship of
the Damsel who was Heiress, and that also of the
Kingdom it self, would have fallen to him by
Law as the Superior: but the Pope evidences
the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That there were Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
of the Kingdom chosen by the Nobles
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:52199:217"/>
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who should take care of the
Government and the Damsel, until a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of Consanguinity could be obtain'd
from the Pope, (for <hi>Edward</hi> the Son and
<hi>Margaret</hi> were in the second and third De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Consanguinity, as I said, and so could
not contract Marriage without a Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:)
and the Pope adds, That there was an
express Proviso made by <hi>Edward</hi> in Writing,
that in case the Marriage should not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on either by the Default of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
or otherwise, That he should leave the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> free and subject to no
Man for ever; and if there happened to be
Children by that Marriage, that he should leave
the Kingdom in its antient State, and restore it
as he received it, that it should retain the Name
and Dignity of a Kingdom as before, both in
enjoying its own Laws, appointing Officers of
State, holding of Parliaments, and deciding
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>auses within the Kingdom, and that none of
the Inhabitants should be obliged to go out of
the same for Iudgment. Now none can call
Parliaments but those who have the Rights
of Majesty; so that if this Proviso granted
by <hi>Edward,</hi> do not put this Question about
the Homage out of all Controversy, I know
not what to say: but that all those things
were contained in <hi>Edward</hi>'s Letters Patents
thereupon granted and produced before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:52199:217"/>
the same Pope doth testify yet more plainly
and fully.</p>
               <p>The Pope's sixth Argument is, that this
<hi>Margaret</hi> being dead, and a Controversy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
amongst the Nobility about the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and therefore
they ought not to subsist in Law, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to the Prejudice of the Kingdom.
From this sixth Argument of the Pope's,
these three things are to be inferred; First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> though at
that time without an Head, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) the
word used by the Pope, would not then
acknowledg the King of <hi>England</hi> as their
Lord or Superior; but being called out of
the Kingdom in order to an Agreement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they obeyed, not as being thereunto obliged,
but out of a special Favour, wherein they
followed the Example of the last King <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
The second is, that this Homage being
extorted from <hi>Baliol,</hi> could not subsist in
Law, which is the same Reason given for
that extorted from King <hi>William</hi> when a
Captive. The third is, that the Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by <hi>Edward</hi> in favour of <hi>Baliol,</hi>
was unduly given, the Modesty of the Word
tempering the Injustice of the Senteno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; for
he might have said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he certainly
thought, that the said Sentence in favour of
<hi>Baliol,</hi> was given contrary to all Law and
Equ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Kingdom, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the Pope's Sentence, of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:52199:218"/>The <hi>7th</hi> Argument is, from the Custom
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for when a Legat
was sent into <hi>England</hi> from the Apostolical
See to exercise his Function, he could not
upon that Pretext proceed to do the same in
<hi>Scotland;</hi> neither ever was he, or ought he
to be admitted by the Scots, except he
brought special Letters from the Pope to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was not necessary
if <hi>Scotland</hi> had been a Fee of <hi>England,</hi> or
that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> had been subject to the
King of <hi>England;</hi> for in that Case, as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
speak, the Embassy into <hi>England</hi> had
been sufficient alone: and in fine, that the
Pope might leave nothing untouch'd, he
brings in also that Controversy betwixt the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ishop of <hi>York</hi> and the Scots Clergy concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Superiority which the Bishop of <hi>York</hi>
did arrogate to himself over all the Scots Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
which as I said before, being brought
into Judgment in <hi>England</hi> could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
though the English Bishops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
did preside, but both Parties appealed
to the Pope; and therefore <hi>Boniface</hi> does
expresly write in that Epistle, that the Bishop
of <hi>York</hi> could never obtain Judgment for
himself, because he produc'd nothing for the
Confirmation of his Cause, but a Letter from
some Scots Bishops, in which they had writ
to the Bishop of <hi>York, Memento quod tui
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:52199:219"/>
su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us, Remember that we are yours;</hi> a most
excellent Argument indeed for a proud Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
who was seeking to overthrow other
Mens Liberty, for writing to him officiously,
<hi>Nos tui sumus, we are Yours.</hi> But to return
to the Pope, he in fine, condemns the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and Intention of the King of <hi>England,</hi>
to subdue <hi>Scotland,</hi> especially being then
without a Head or Captain, and trusting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
wholly to the King of <hi>England;</hi> and
he admonishes him sharply to withdraw
thence on Pain of Excommunication, and
leave the Scots to their own Liberties and
Laws; and if he had any equitable Plea to
alledg for himself, that he should appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him by his Ambassadors within six
Months, to answer the Scots upon that Head,
for there were then Scots Ambassadors at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and in their Calamities they did implore
the Assistance of the Pope as Liege Lord of
<hi>England.</hi> The Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
brought this Denunciation of the Pope's to
<hi>Edward,</hi> then raging in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
him to leave that Kingdom on pain
of Excommunication, <hi>Edward</hi> being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
afraid of the Pope's threats, swore <hi>by
the Blood of God, for</hi> Sion<hi>'s sake will I not
hold my Peace, and for</hi> Jerusalem <hi>will I not be
at rest, (alluding to those words,</hi> Sion <hi>and</hi> Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<hi>in the Pope's Message) while there's Breath
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:52199:219"/>
in my Nostrils, but will defend my Right, which
is known to all the World, to the utmost of my
Power.</hi> And therefore that he might obviate
the Pope's threatnings, he sent two Letters
to him, one from himself, and another from
his Nobility, both of them Apologetical, in
defence of his Superiority over <hi>Scotland:</hi>
The Tenor of those Letters, is to be found
both in <hi>Westminster</hi> and <hi>Walsingham;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall go through the Heads of them
briefly, that all Men may see how strong and
concluding the Pope's Arguments were for
the Liberty of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and what weak,
empty and trifling Arguments <hi>Edward</hi> brings
for maintaining his Homage. Beginning then
with the ordinary Preface of kissing the
Pope's Feet, he says, That he and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
in all Ages past, had a direct Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and presided over <hi>Scotland,</hi> and gave
the Reins of that Government into whose
Hands they pleas'd, and dethroned them as
they saw occasion; and to elude all Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
alledges, that these things are so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
that they need no Proof, because he
was sure, that if Proof was required, his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
would be exposed, and that he should
not be able to produce any: But lest it should
be thought he had done nothing, he brings
the first Argument for his direct Dominion,
from the Fable of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and his division of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:52199:220"/>
                  <hi>Britain</hi> amongst his three Sons, reserving the
Royal Dignity to <hi>Locrinus</hi> his eldest; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
neither the names of Homage nor Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
were known to the World for 2000
Years after <hi>Brutus,</hi> as I said before, if ever
there was any such Man as he. The second
is, that <hi>Dunwallo</hi> killed <hi>Staterius</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi>
for his Rebellion, and had <hi>Scotland</hi> yielded up
to him, which does not infer a Superiority,
but the manifest Subversion thereof, if there
was any; if the Vassal's Fee be yielded up to
the Lord, and consolidate with the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority.
But this <hi>Dunwallo</hi> reigned before
<hi>Rome</hi> was taken by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> at which time
if there was any such thing as the Name of
Scots, or a King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I leave it to the
Judgment of the candid Reader. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Historians do stifly maintain, that the
Scots did not come into <hi>Britain</hi> before the
time of <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was any such King of <hi>Scots</hi> as <hi>Staterius, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

does not so much as suggest. It's really
strange, that Mens minds should be so much
set upon Fictions, that they are not afraid
of saying any thing, so it may but reproach
their Enemies. What is subjoined concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Brennus</hi> and <hi>Belinus,</hi> is of the same
stamp; for if <hi>Brennus</hi> was King of <hi>Scotland</hi>

of Glory has this imprudent Man rais'd the

should say, that the Law of Prim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

concerning <hi>Arthur,</hi> as I said above, for that
there was a King of <hi>Scots</hi> called <hi>Auguselinus,</hi>

us go on, The English succeeding to the
Kingdom of the <hi>Britains,</hi> they did together
with their Monarchy obtain this Dominion
over <hi>Scotland,</hi> says <hi>Edward;</hi> but I pray by
what Right? for this is not a good Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that if any one despoil another of
his Country or drive him into Exile, that
therefore he must be his lawful Heir. I have
answered what relates to <hi>Ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the ridiculous Miracle of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

as also what concerns the Cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t in a
huge Rock at <hi>Dumbar</hi> of an Ell in length
made by <hi>Athelstan's</hi> Sword, the Monument
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:52199:221"/>
of which is still to be seen there, says <hi>Edward,</hi>
though I believe that whoever goes to seek
it in that Place will lose his Labour, there are
so many gaping Rocks there. There are
two things which he brings as most strong
Arguments, one, that this Miracle is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ead
weekly in <hi>Iohn's Legend;</hi> and what if he could
have said, that it had been read in the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<hi>Legend?</hi> but pray where's the Miracle if
the Scots beat the English, or the English
beat the Scots? for that was not such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
thing in either of the Nations. The
second is, that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> was Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Athelstan's</hi> Son; cannot that Honour
be done to one Prince by another, but they
must needs be said to perform Homage? But
by the same Argument some idle Brain may
argue, that the most august Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is subject to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> because
by her Ambassadors she was Godmother to
the King of <hi>Scots</hi> and his Son the Prince.
As to <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that he who swears Fealty to another,
must needs be his Subject, except it be Liege
Fealty, for every Body knows that there is

The Nobility of <hi>England</hi> did write to

was not at all to be doubted of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could not bear it that their King

I believe truly, that it happened to
us, as it did of old to the Britains; who
though they took an Oath of perpetual Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
from the Saxons, who were their
Guests and Mercenaries, yet were at last dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poil'd
of their Country, depriv'd of all their
Riches, driven into <hi>Wales,</hi> suffered all
manner of Injuries that could be done or
said by the Saxons, and were also lash'd
with all manner of Reproaches. Nay, <hi>Bed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself does frequently upbraid them with
Perfidiousness; though I don't find in any
English Historian, that ever the Britains
swore Fealty to the Saxons, or much less
broke their Oath to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:52199:223"/>These things I have added concerning the
Letters that pass'd betwixt <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
that from their Controversy we might
have the full Knowledg of this Affair; for
we could never have a better nor easier
View of what's to be said and thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Homage. But our Neighbours
will say, that their Cause is no way prejudg'd
nor affected by this Papal Verdict, which is
false; for if <hi>Scotland</hi> was then a Fee of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as they assert without either Shame or
Authority, the Pope was the most lawful
Judg and Ordinary of this Controversy:
For <hi>Iohn,</hi> Grand-father to this <hi>Edward,</hi> did
subject the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to the See
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and took the Jurisdiction thereof
upon him: and therefore if the King of <hi>Scots</hi>
was a Sub vassal, to whom should he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
concerning the Injury done him, but
to his Liege-Lord? The People of <hi>Aquitain</hi>
being oppress'd with Tributes and Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> they made
their Complaints to the French King, which
occasion'd the Loss of <hi>Aquitain:</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Feudal Law, if the Sub-vassal be
cruelly and unjustly us'd by the immediate
Vassal, he has liberty to sue him before the
Lord who is superior to them both. Not
that I do think the Pope was ever Judg in
Scots Affairs; but that it was common at
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:52199:223"/>
that time for all who were oppress'd with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
and unable to resist, to implore
the Assistance of the Pope in their Adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because he was then believ'd to have a
Jurisdiction over all Christian Princes: Nay,
he did arrogate the same to himself; alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that of the Prophet <hi>Isaia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>ooted up.</hi> When he call'd himself Lord of
<hi>France</hi> upon that account, and threatned
<hi>Philip the Fair</hi> with a Pontifical Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt,
except he would acknowledg him as
such; the French King ordered his Letters
to be burnt in the publick Market-place at
<hi>Paris,</hi> the Sorbonists assisting at the same.
Nor did he desist from his Purpose, until he
depriv'd the Pope both of his Life and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
This I bring only, that all Men may
know that the Popes did at that time usurp a
Power over Emperors and Kings, that so
they may wonder the less at his asserting,
that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> did appertain
to him.</p>

be done with the fifty Scotish Youths whom
he had as Hostages, he commanded all of

and was join'd also by abundance of
Scots; but <hi>Bruce</hi> having wasted the Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
through which he was to march, <hi>Edward</hi>
was forc'd to retire into <hi>England</hi> for want of
Forage, pretending that he durst not trust
the Scotish Auxiliaries. But <hi>Bruce</hi> pursuing
him, ravaged the most fruitful Provinces of
<hi>England,</hi> and maintain'd his Army there
most part of the Winter; and at his return
abundance of the Scots who perceiv'd the

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:52199:228"/>
Souldiers from <hi>Normandy, Britany,
Aquitain, Flanders,</hi> and other transmarin
Provinces, which were then subject unto
him. There did also flock to him all Men
who were drown'd in Debt, Spendthrifts,
Criminals, those of desperate Fortunes, and
such as had neither Credit nor Wealth to
live upon at home, that the Scotish Nation
being destroyed they might settle there, as
thinking that the very Sight of such an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was sufficient to conquer the Scots, or
at least that by one Day's labour they should
purchase Estates to the themselves for ever. Some
say there were 300000 fighting-Men in that
Army, others 150000, and the least Number
mentioned by any Historian is 100000: But
<hi>Bruce</hi> marching against them with 30000
chosen Men, inur'd to all the Fatigues and
Hardships of War, routed and put that vast
Army to flight, killing 50000, and taking
as many: but he behaved himself with much
more Magnanimity and Clemency than <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
did after his Victory at <hi>Falkirk;</hi> and
was so far from revenging the barbarous
Execution of his three gallant Brethren, and
others of the Scotish Peers, or the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Calamities which the Scots had suffered

Nor did the Scots content themselves

This I mention that our Neighbours may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand

                  </gap> the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

his own Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> and whereas

                  <q>Edvardus primus Scotorum malleus hic est;</q>
               </p>
               <p>They ought to have writ on <hi>Edward</hi> the

<q>Filius Edvardus Scotorum funditur armis.</q>
Nor did the English act any thing conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
against the Scots during the Reigns of
this <hi>Edward,</hi> which they ascribe to his ill

doing so, provided they would allow the

               <p>But <hi>Holinshed</hi> tells us wonders of <hi>Edward</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the third, whom the English call
their Hector, desiring to revenge his Father's
disgrace, in the beginning of his Reign as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
a great Army, having also sent for
abundance of Forces from <hi>Hainault</hi> and the
<hi>Netherlands</hi> to invade <hi>Scotland;</hi> but being
eluded and kept in play by a small Army of
<hi>Scots,</hi> and almost slain in the middle of his own
Camp by <hi>Iames Douglas</hi> the <hi>Achilles</hi> of that
time, who entred the same couragiously with
two hundred Horse, <hi>Edward</hi> was obliged to
retire without so much as seeing <hi>Scotland;</hi> and
finding himself scarce able otherwise to bear
up against the Valour of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that he
might consult the quiet of his own People,
he married his Sister <hi>Ioanna</hi> to <hi>David Bruce,</hi>
by consent of his Peers, having abjur'd all
right of Dominion or Superiority, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
all the Monuments which contained
the Homage, even <hi>Holinshed</hi> himself being
witness; and therefore I wonder at the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
of that Man, who asserts, that all
those Monuments are still kept by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.
<hi>Walsingham</hi> says, that he made Charters
to resign all right and claim of Superiority,
which either he or his Progenitors had over
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:52199:230"/>
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Then what could
be said more express? Homage was twice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
for <hi>Scotland,</hi> once from King <hi>William,</hi>
and afterwards from <hi>Baliol,</hi> and the King
of <hi>England</hi> was twice compell'd to abjure
it.</p>
               <p>As to what was done by <hi>Edward Baliol</hi>
we don't regard it, for he followed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
footsteps; and the Scots did drive both
him and the King of <hi>England</hi> out of their
Nation by force of Arms, though I confess,
they received many overthrows first: and
this is wonderful and worthy to be observ'd,
that in all those Wars the English were
still victorious at first, yet at long run they
were constantly forced to quit the Kingdom,
though not without mutual Overthrows:
But it is still a greater Wonder, that this <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
being a magnanimous Prince, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
worthy of all Commendation, having
when he married his Sister to <hi>David</hi> King
of <hi>Scots</hi> establish'd a perpetual Peace by
Oath, which was promised to be sincerely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
on both sides; and did at the same time
abjure that Homage, that he should never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
assist <hi>Edward Baliol,</hi> Son to <hi>Iohn Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liol,</hi>
with 4000 armed Men, to recover the

Vail every where to cover this matter with,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:52199:230"/>
but all in vain: for <hi>Edward,</hi> according to the
manner of his Forefathers, did so greedily
gape after this Homage, that it's hard to say,
whether the English did covet, or the Scots
refuse it, with the greatest Eagerness; but
there's none but your self, Mr. <hi>Holinshed,</hi>
who ever asserted, that <hi>David</hi> performed
Homage to him; for though he was not so
fortunate in War as his Father, yet he never
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eased making War upon <hi>England</hi> while he
was able, but what he did during his Captivity
is uncertain, for that he perform'd Homage,
is neither writ by <hi>Walsingham,</hi> nor any other
English Historian of that time. But if he
performed it during his Captivity, which yet
is not said by any Historian, the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
did little consult his own Honour, to
extort Homage from a Prisoner who was not
his own Master: for there's nothing so inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
nay I may say, so dishonest as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
any Right from a Man who is not his
own Master, but hath lost his Liberty, and
so is not oblig'd to perform such Obligations,
as I said formerly in King <hi>William;</hi> and all
Laws and Nations agree in this, that there
ought to be a Restitution where Consent
hath been obtain'd by Force and Violence.
That is also vain, and derogates mightily from
the reputation of the English, which <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshed</hi>
says, that <hi>Baliol</hi> the younger resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:52199:231"/>
into the Hands of <hi>Edward</hi> all the Right
which he had to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
that the said <hi>Edward</hi> the third received the
Royal Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> from him. How
came it to pass then, that this King who was
the most fortunate of all their Kings in War,
and was call'd the Hector of <hi>England,</hi> was
dispossess'd of the Crown of <hi>Scotland?</hi> But
all those things which are writ by <hi>Holinshed,</hi>
are to be mark'd with the Censor's Note, as
also what he subjoins concerning <hi>Robert</hi> and
<hi>Henry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You write that <hi>Robert</hi> the third delivered
his Son <hi>Iames</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth as into
Wardship, wherein you do manifestly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the History against <hi>Polidore,</hi> and all the
other English Writers: For King <hi>Robert</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afraid of intestine Broils, sent his Son
<hi>Iames</hi> privately for <hi>France</hi> with only one
Ship, that he might live retiredly there; but
he was taken by the English Fleet contrary
to the Faith of the Truce in his Passage,
which <hi>Polidore</hi> does not dissemble, and was
detained there eighteen Years, there being
in the mean time a most cruel War betwixt
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> The Historians of
both Nations say, that he was ransom'd with
Money, and that the King of <hi>England</hi> might
ensure his Friendship, he married him to
his Kinswoman the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi>'s
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:52199:231"/>
Daughter, having no Daughter of his own;
but neither his being admitted to ransom by
the English, who at that tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Soveraignty of <hi>France,</hi> nor his Wife's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
not any other consideration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
could withhold him from assisting the
French, whose Affairs were then in a ruinous
Condition with two compleat Armies which
he sent into <hi>France:</hi> I grant it is true, that
during his being detain'd Prisoner, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<hi>Henry</hi> the fifth into <hi>France,</hi> that
he might withdraw the Scots Army, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
the English, and killed <hi>George</hi> Duke
of <hi>Clarence, Henry</hi> the fifth's Brother, from
the Assistance of the French: but that I may
here repeat what I said before, the Scots
who did at that time serve in <hi>France,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that they would not acknowledg
<hi>Iames</hi> for their King so long as he was in the
Power of his Enemies; but as soon as he
was ransom'd, he attaqu'd the English with
so much Vigour, that he prevented their
sending Forces or Recruits into <hi>France,</hi> and
so that Kingdom was delivered out of the
Hands of the English. What <hi>Iames</hi> did
while he was in the Enemies Hand, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the Purpose, and if <hi>Holinshed</hi> may
be credited, the King of <hi>England</hi> acted very
dishonourably, in forcing him at that time to
perform Homage; but there's no English Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:52199:232"/>
that I know of, who makes mention
of the same, nay, not so much as <hi>Holinshed</hi>
himself, in the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> or <hi>6th;</hi>
and therefore it must of necessity be a Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

to ward off the Disgrace of the English in

who thought himself safe because of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

to Custody; I would not for any thing that
<hi>Holinshed</hi> could object so much against us.
After that time there's none who received
any Homage from the Scots, though <hi>Henry</hi>

speak, would obtrude this Commentitious

either of deceiving others, or being mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken

Writers, that the Scots had performed
Homage, they applied it as <hi>dictum secundum

<hi>viz.</hi> that Homage had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
is but too familiar with Mr. <hi>Holinshed.</hi> But
that I may come to the Kings of the <hi>Norman</hi>
Race, who of all the Kennel of Cloistered
Monks did every say, that Homage was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> either to
<hi>William</hi> the Father or Son, or to <hi>Henry</hi> the

<hi>Malcolm</hi> and <hi>William</hi> us'd, <hi>viz.</hi> with a Salvo
for their own Dignities and Rights; and
sometimes it was expresly added, for their

                  </gap>nd that <hi>Scotland</hi> was always independent,
both in his Time and that of his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors;
why then should we fatigue our selves
in a Matter so plain, seeking a Knot in a Rush,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s the saying is, when the Kings of <hi>England</hi>
themselves do testify, that the Kingdom of
<hi>Scotland</hi> was free from any kind of Homage,
and own, that the Homage was due only for
the Beneficiary Provinces? What <hi>William</hi>
King of <hi>Scots</hi> did, or what Right was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
from him when he was not Master of
himself, signifies little, as I have said before.
After King <hi>William's</hi> time, the Kings of <hi>Scots,
Alexander</hi> the second and third, when they
heard of some Rumours spread by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
concerning this Homage, declared War
against them, that there might be no suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of their Servitude conveyed to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
nay as it appears plainly by that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of <hi>Boniface, Alexander</hi> the third when
he performed that Homage to the <hi>Hammer of
the Scots (Scotorum Malleo)</hi> as they call <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the first, declar'd plainly and expresly in
the Audience of a great Multitude, that he
did only perform the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ame for the Benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
Counties which he held in <hi>England,</hi> but
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:52199:234"/>
that he neither ow'd, nor would perform a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
accepted of the Homage on those Terms:
and in Truth according to my Opinion, he
had acted more wisely, and consulted the
Interest of himself and his Subjects better,
if he had still left those Provinces to be held
in F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e by the Scots; for they had neither
been so soon dispossess'd of their Hereditary
Possessions in <hi>France,</hi> nor should have found
their own Subjects so mutinous. But let
them see to that, we will return to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Scotland</hi> is neither a Fee of <hi>England,</hi>
nor that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> owes any Homage
to the King of <hi>England,</hi> appears from this,
that the Vassal is oblig'd to seek a Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Fee, as often as either the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Lord or Vassal is chang'd within
the Year, otherwise he loses all Right to his
Fee: But at the Inauguaration of our Kings,
the Consent of the King of <hi>England</hi> was
never requir'd, nor was ever the renewal of
the Investiture demanded from any Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> but for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
2000 Years, the next of the Blood
did constantly succeed in a continued Series,
the like whereof is not to be found in any
Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> no not in <hi>France</hi> it self,
without Vanity be it spoken; so that they
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:52199:234"/>
were not subjected to the Choice of any
Man, nor was there any Room for the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Command of the King of <hi>England</hi>
in the Case. <hi>Baliol</hi> was the only Man who
ever had Investiture from the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and that he purchas'd by Bribery: but
never did any King before him, nor any of
those who came after him, receive the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of Royalty from the Hands of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than their own Countrymen; and as
for <hi>Edward Baliol</hi> who followed his Father's
Example, and swore Homage to the King of
<hi>England,</hi> we never acknowledg'd him for
King.</p>
               <p>There can be neither War, Peace, nor
Truce betwixt the Lord and the Vassal; for
those things are transacted betwix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but that there hath been Peace, Truce
and War, betwixt the Scots and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
is owned by all the English Historians,
though <hi>Holinshed</hi> does here call it Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
               <p>And as for your Court and Parliament,
we did not only never acknowledg their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
over us, but were never sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to them: So that from those things,
the impartial Reader will be able to judg,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:52199:235"/>
whether the King of <hi>England</hi> could claim
any Right of Superiority over <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this we may add, that as in a military
Fee, the Wardship of the Heir is due to the
Lord, who during the Vassal's Minority has
the Administration of the Fee, and in the
mean time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

first, second, third and <hi>4th, Mary,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi>

Though during the Minority of Vassals, the

the Administration of the Fee, do according
to the Laws of both Kingdoms, belong to
the Lord: and who ever read or heard that

of so many Princes? Nor is it credible
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:52199:235"/>
that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> would have been
wanting to have demanded their Right, who
did so greedily catch at every Opportunity
of enjoying this Kingdom especially when
their Kings were not capable of defending
the same during their Nonage.</p>
               <p>Moreover, who ever writes that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the English King was requir'd in
matching our Princes? or who i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or double Value of the Dower, according to
the Laws of Wardship? But that which is
more, seeing according to the Feudal Law,
the Heir can neither contract Friendship nor
Alliance with his Lord's Enemies; our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
did often, nay, almost always marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
those who were greatest Enemies to
the English. Those things will be easily
perceived by any Man, who is not as dull
as a Stock, to be no part of a Vassal's duty
to his Lord, but the quite contrary, and
that all this counterfeit show of Homage or
Tutelary Fealty, is a mere Fiction.</p>
               <p>Nor is this to be omitted, that according
to the Feudal Law, if there be any Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have been in Possession of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
now for three hundred Years since
<hi>Baliol</hi>'s time, the English themselves being

obtained that Homage from us for so
long time.</p>
               <p>Who ever heard that the consent of the

               <p>We have hitherto retained the Soveraign
Majesty inviolable, without being subject
to any Body; our Kings administred Justice
according as they themselves thought meet,
made War and Peace with whom they
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:52199:236"/>
pleased, granted Letters of Reprisal and
such other things which never use to be done
by any other than real and independant
Kings: On the other Hand, what has the
King of <hi>England</hi> done that we should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
him for Soveraign, seeing that
Bond betwixt the Lord and Vassal does not
so much consist in Words, as in Fealty, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
and good Offices?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valvasors, Valvasins,</hi> and the rest of the
inferiour Orders of Beneficiaries, if they be
unjustly oppress'd by their Lord, they use
to appeal unto their Superior, to whom the
Cognizance and Examination of the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
belongs: This the King of <hi>England</hi>
was made sensible of when <hi>Edward the Black
Prince</hi> did oppress <hi>Aquitain</hi> with Taxes
and Impositions. The <hi>Aquitains</hi> appealed
from their immediate Lord the King of
<hi>England,</hi> to their Liege Lord the King of
<hi>France,</hi> who did also give Sentence in their
Favours; which the King of <hi>England</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to obey, <hi>Aquitain</hi> was taken away from
him, and restored to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi>
which holds it to this Day. But when did
Scotsmen, though frequently injur'd by
their Kings, appeal to the King of <hi>England,</hi>
or when was the Cognizance of our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
devolved upon you? Inferiour <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasors</hi>
are obliged to assist their Supream
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:52199:237"/>
Lord against their immediate Lord with their
Lives and Fortunes; but when did we assist
the English against our own Prince?</p>
               <p>Nay our Kings have not only been always
look'd upon and acknowledg'd as supreme
and independent in the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by Foreigners, <hi>viz.</hi> the Emperor, Kings
of <hi>France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but the Kings of <hi>England</hi> themselves
have always given as great Titles of Honour
and Dignity to our Kings, in their Letters,
and Contracts of Alliance or Peace, as ever
they received from ours, or as ever they
gave to the most potent Kings of <hi>Europe</hi> who
are invested with the Rights of Majesty:
Which is a most certain Evidence, that the
Majesty of our Kings had never suffered any
Diminution, and this is unusual to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by a Lord to his Vassal.</p>
               <p>There is lastly, that adamantine or invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
League betwixt the French and the
Scots; which could never be infring'd by
any Revolution of time, and wherein both
Kings do expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sly promise upon Oath to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
one another against their common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
the English, with offensive and defensive
Arms: and that this League was made 200
Years before the Norman Conquest, <hi>Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</hi>
himself bears us witness. And though
that League hath cost us the Ransom of three
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:52199:237"/>
Kings, and the Lives of 100000 Men, yet it
may be said concerning it, that
<q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>—Nec Iovis ira, nec ignis,</l>
                        <l>Nec potuit ferrum nec edax abolere Vetustas.</l>

could part.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
Nor is there any thing that makes more
against that fictitious Homage, than this
League, which is still kept in the Archives
of both Kingdoms. For where was it ever
heard of, that another King's Liege-man, or
Vassal, entred into a League with his Lord's
Enemy? For the Vassal is obliged to take
Arms for his Lord and his Dignity, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his Lord requires it, and to lay them
down again at his Command.</p>
               <p>But here some of our Country-men will
object, that all this Labour is in vain; for
where's the Dishonour of it, that we being
formerly Vassals to the English, have now
shook off their Yoke for 300 Years? and
that it's certainly more for the Disgrace of
the English, that they have been beat from
the Possession of this feigned Homage. I
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:52199:238"/>
answer, that I am sensible of the Truth of
the things objected: For <hi>Bodinus</hi> being mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the English Writers, when he writes
that <hi>Constantine</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> reigned as Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
to <hi>Athelstan,</hi> and that <hi>Baliol</hi> did professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> as a Fee of
<hi>England;</hi> he subjoins, but the Scots Kings
ever since <hi>Baliol's</hi> time, have abjur'd the
English Homage, and never would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
the King of <hi>England</hi> their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,

right in this one thing, in consulting his own
Reputation by not putting his History in

Honours and Power; but will not yield
to you, nor any Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> either in
Antiquity of Government or Lineage. You
have also Riches with which you are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to hire Mercenary Souldiers: You
have moreover, Publick Navies, Fleets, Great
Guns; and above all, you do cultivate Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Discipline. For us, our Wealth is
but small to hire Souldiers; we have no
Publick Armories, no Great Guns, are much
inferiour to you in Number, have no Royal
or Publick Fleet, no Fortified Towns, and
scarcely a Castle or two which are safe
from the Attacks of Enemies; and which
hath always been much to our Disadvantage,
no Military Discipline.</p>
               <p>Certainly we should have been in a very
ill Condition long e're now, if there had
not been something to supply such, and
so many Defects. King <hi>Eumenes,</hi> when his

his own but the Castle in which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,
yet when a Peace came to be treated

he answered, <q>That he would acknowledg
