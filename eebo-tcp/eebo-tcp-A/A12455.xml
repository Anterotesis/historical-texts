         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

 the condition of his ship, victuall, and Company; for if there be more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then Saylers, how sleightly soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer many esteeme Saylers, all the worke to saue Ship, goods, and liues, must lye vpon them, especially in foule wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the labour, hazard, wet and cold is so incredible I cannot expresse it. It is not then the number of them that here will say at home, what I cannot <pb n="38" facs="tcp:11395:21"/>
doe, I can quickly learne, and what a great matter it is to sayle a Ship, or goe to Sea, surely those for a good time will doe most trouble then good, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it is more necessary such should go, but not too many in one ship, for if the labour of sixty should lye vppon thirty, as many times it doth; they are so ouer-charged with labour, bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and ouer-strayning themselues, for there is no dallying nor excuses, with stormes, gusts, over growne seas, and Icy shores; they fall sicke of one disease or other, and then if their Victuals be putrified, it indangers all. Men of all other professions in lightning, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, stormes and tempests, with raine, and snow, may shelter themselues in dry houses, by good fires, and good cheare; but those are the chiefe times, that Sea-men must stand to their tacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and attend with all diligence their greatest labour vpon the Deckes: Many supposeth any thing is good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <pb n="39" facs="tcp:11395:21"/>
to serue men at sea, and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sufficient for them a shore, either for their healthes, for their ease, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, or state. A Commaunder at sea should do well to thinke the contrary, and prouide for himselfe and company in like manner; also seriously to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what will be his charge, to furnish himselfe at sea, with bedding, linnen, armes and apparell; how to keepe his table aboord, his expences on shore, and his petty tally, which is a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent proportion according to your number, of these particulars following.</p>
            <p>Fine wheat flower, close and well packed, <hi>Rise, Currands, Sugar, Prunes, Cinamon, Ginger, Pepper, Cloues, Greene-ginger, Oyle, Butter, Olde Cheese,</hi> or <hi>Holland, Wine vinegar, Canary Sacke, Aqua vitae, the best Wines, the best Waters, the iuyce of Lemons</hi> for the Scuruey, <hi>white Bisket, Oate-meale, Gammons of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Some it may bee will say, I would haue men rather to feast then fight. But I say the want of those necessaries, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions the losse of more men, then in any <hi>English</hi> fleet hath bin slaine in any fight since 88. for when a man is ill sicke, or at the poynt of death, I would know whether a dish of buttered Rice, with a little Cinamon and Sugar, a little min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced meate, or roast beefe, a few stewed Prunes, a race of greene ginger, a flap-Iacke, a Can of fresh water brued with a little Cinamon, Ginger and Sugar, be not better then a little poore <hi>Iohn,</hi> or salt fish, with oyle and mustard, or bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, butter, cheese or oatemeale pottage on fish dayes, salt beefe, porke and pease and sixe shillings beere, this is your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ships allowance, and good for <pb n="41" facs="tcp:11395:22"/>
them are well, if well conditioned, which is not alwayes, as sea-men can too well witnesse: and after a storme, when poore men are all wet, and some not so much a cloth to shift him, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with cold, few of those but will tell you, a little Sacke or Aquavitae, is much better to keepe them in health, then a little small beere or cold water, although it be sweete, now that euery one should prouide those things for himselfe, few of them haue either that prouidence or meanes. And there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alehouse, Tauerne, nor Inne to burne a fagot in, neither Grocer, Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, Apothocary, nor Butchers shop: and therefore the vse of this petty tally is necessary, and thus to be imployed as there is occasion, to entertaine stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as they are in quality, euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander should shewe himselfe as like himselfe as he can, as well for the credit of the ship and his settors forth as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but in that heerein euery one <pb n="42" facs="tcp:11395:23"/>
may moderate themselues according to their owne pleasures, therefore I leaue it to their owne discretions. And this briefe Discourse, and my selfe, to their friendly construction and good opinion.</p>
