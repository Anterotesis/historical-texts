            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

much as to wonder. The wall is built so low of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that the statelinesse of the Citie may appeare

the wall is of twelue precious stones, the Iasper,
the Saphire, the Calcedonicke, the Emerauld,
the Sardonix, the Sardius, the Chrysolith, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,

gates, in all poynts correspondent vnto the stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the wall, three toward the East, as many

and three toward the South: euerie seuerall gate
is one of those twelue seuerall precious stones, and
no one of the gates without all the rest of the
stones, but they are not so much beautified by

they haue neither power nor leysure to apply
themselues to any other, more then that they loue
each other, in respect that euerie one loueth him,

            <p>How daintily doe they feede, whose meate and

any thing doe please without danger of poyson,
it is his loue: if any thing bee able to quicken

well did the Poets aime at the truth, when they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19856:5"/>
sayd that loue was a God, but shot much wide,
when they fayned that hee was blinded, whose

life to all men, but neuer woundeth hee any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

his glorious throne, no eye is able to behold, his
profound wisedome no vnderstanding is able to

resist, hee liueth in light inaccessible, hee ruleth
with maiestie incomparable, and because his verie

to attempt to set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oorth the worthinesse of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
In his workes hee hath shewed himselfe so
prouident, as all may iustly admire him, so good, as
all may aboue all loue him, so sweet as all may ioy

               </gap>ere to limit his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
which are beyond all bounds, because they
are infinite.</p>
            <p>With this Emperour liued the aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Princes, without any tediousnesse, desire of
change, or any kinde of sorrow, being incapable of
any thing but happinesse, vntill a maruailous rare
and rigorous seeming accident befell them, for
their Emperour hauing one onely sonne, equall
vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o his father in power, might, and authoritie,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19856:5"/>
and in no one poynt of perfection, degenerating
from him, from both whome, for the infinite
likenesse betwixt them, proceeded an infinite loue,
hee deputed him to a publike, shamefull, and a
painefull death, which did so amaze the Princes
attendant, whose loue was no lesse vnto him,
then vnto his father, that (might they haue beene
suffered) they would all haue sustained that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
to haue saued their Prince, but their
offer was refused, for the sentence was irreuocable.</p>
            <p>The motiue of this vnnaturall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>seeming iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was an exceeding great loue, which hee
bare vnto a Lady his adopted daughter, who
was so enchaunted by her owne folly, as of a most
comely and beautifull creature, shee became so
mishapen and so vgly, that shee was loathsome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto her selfe. This enchauntment was by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an apple, of which her father before had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
her warning shee should not taste, vpon perill
of that which should ensue thereof: but her pride
was so great, that ingratefull to so good a Lord,
and disobedient to so carefull a father, shee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the motion which was made vnto her by
a false, though a fayre spoken enemie, and eate
thereof contrarie to her father his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Enchantment was so deuised, that hauing
taken effect, it should not bee dissolued but by the
death of the onely sonne of an Emperour, who
should exceede all the princes in the world in giftes
both of bodie and minde: he should bee peerelesse
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19856:6"/>
for his birth, riches, beautie, wisedom, and might;
whose father should neuer know any woman, nor
his mother any man, and should in the very selfe
same instant both haue and want both father and
mother. The liking by any such prince of such an
vnlouely Lady being vnlike, and the birth of anie
such prince or other seeming impossible, made the
Enchanter secure, that this his work should endure
for euer.</p>
            <p>The Enchanter himselfe was one of more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
then might, but yet of more might then an
vnrulie assailed could well resist. Hee was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
a prince of the Emperour his court, &amp; among
princes a prince, being endewed with farre more
excellent gifts then any his fellow princes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
vnto that honor, as hee was reputed the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
vnder his Lord and Maister: but bearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
so proudly against his maker, hee found by too
late an experience, that hee who bestowed those
graces vpon him, could also againe bereaue him of
them, and because hee had once abused them with
intollerable pride, hee should euer after be abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of them to his eternal pain. To reuenge which
disgrace hee assayed the Ladye the Emperour his
daughter, and wonne her loue so farre foorth, as
shee gaue more credite vnto him, then vnto her
father, and would do more at his request, then at
her fathers commaundement, for although she see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at the first to haue a small liking vnto his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet with faire promises, and too farre aboue
his power to performe; in the ende hee made her
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19856:6"/>
giue a consent vnto her vtter ouerthrow, had not
the Emperour his sonne being deputed by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thereunto, vndertaken to release her by the
losse of his owne life.</p>
            <p>The ransome being appointed to be disbursed
infinitely exceeding that, which was to bee redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
too gracious for so vngracious a creature, and
too bountifull for her, who wilfully made herselfe
bondslaue, by selling outright a royall and reall
good for a proud imaginatiue Godhead, a great
difficultie arose in what manner it should be paid,
for the prince being of so excellent a nature, that he
was not capable of the smallest annoyance, and in
so strong a hold, that hee could not sustaine the least
harme, much lesse the losse of his life, it was needfull
he should both take vppon him a nature, and abide
in such place, as in which, and where he might ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
his desire,</p>
            <p>Here loue (which maketh euery one it possesseth
to conforme themselues vnto their loue) quicklie
determined what was in doubt, and make this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;
that hee should take vppon him the same
nature, of which his sister was, and her peruerse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
onely excepted, hee should in all thinges bee
like vnto her, which conceit loue made so confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
vnto his former counsell, as the more hee
thought vppon it, the fitter the meanes seemed to
bring his purpose to a good passe. For first he thoght
that hereby hee might in a most louelie manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
her companie, whome hee so entirely loued
without giuing any cause of ielousie to her ouerdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19856:7"/>
keeper: Secondly, hee thought, that the
keper taking him for his captiue, might the more
easily be ouertaken by his carelesnes: Thirdly, he
thought this nature fittest for his purpose, that shee
whome hee loued being of the same nature, might
the better gesse at the torture hee should suffer for
her sake; because, by the shedding of his blood, hee
was to worke her safety, and fancy him the sooner,
who would aduenture so far to win her loue, who
was not worthy of a good looke.</p>
            <p>Wisedome therefore guiding the sterne as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
as loue seemed continually to fill the sayles,
the prince proceedeth with no lesse policy then
speede, and searching who of vnworthies was least
vnworthy, (for no one was worthy to mother such
a sonne) hee founde a maiden so farre exceeding
all the rest, that he thought it both needles to seeke
any further, shee was so fitte for his purpose, and
impossible to finde her peere, she was so pure a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
shee was descended of a princely race, but
liued very obscurely, and although she were espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to a mate, yet meant she to remaine a maiden A
princely ofspring was fittest to conceiue such a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty,
and a poore maiden meetest to cloake so high
a mystery, of her he determined to bee borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Father, who before all beginnings was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
without a mother.</p>

a streight course vntill it came to the dead sea,

(which also was on the East side of the countrie, and
reached vnto the mountaines which parted the
south borders of <hi>Palestina</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the desart of <hi>Pharan.)</hi>
The place where this sea is, was sometime both so
pleasant and profitable, as it was compared vnto the
highest his Paradise: insomuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> giuing
his nephew <hi>Lot</hi> his choise, where he would go feed
his flockes (willing to preuent such strife as was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to grow between them by the falling out of their
shepheards) <hi>Lot</hi> preferred this part before all the rest
of the countrie, but the inhabitants increasing in
wickednesse, as much as in wealth, prouoked God
to so great wrath against them, that he consumed
them all with fire, and all the countrie for the space
of foure or fiue dayes iourney in length, and fiue or
sixe miles in breadth, and this is the quantitie of the
dead sea, which casteth vp many times great clods
of clay, in colour like pitch, in smell like Brimstone,
in holding togither that to which it is vsed (for it
was long before vsed in place of mortar in their
buildings) so strong as neither any force, fire, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
could dissolue it: and these valleyes (where the
sea is) were verie full of this kinde of clay, before the
countrie was destroyed. This sea breathed out very
often great flames of fire, as if it had within it many
furnaces, that, what with fire, and the filthinesse of
the water, the trees within fiue miles compasse, did
either beare nothing, or onely a likenes of fruit: for
when it was touched or opened, nothing appeared
but ashes, although before it were touched, it had an
exceeding fresh, and liuely colour. Moreouer this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19856:8"/>
qualitie had this sea, that what heauy thing soeuer
was cast into it (so that it were no dead thing) it
would neuer sinke: for triall whereof, <hi>Vespafian</hi> the
Roman Emperour (by whom the countrie was last
spoiled of her peerlesse beautie) caused certain men
to be cast aliue into the sea, with their hands bound
behinde them, who risse presently vnto the top,
and lay there as securely from drowning, as they
could haue beene vpon any drie land, and therefore
perchance is it called the dead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ea, not because no
quicke thing liueth in it, but because it will not
brooke any quicke thing, nor any thing which
hath any similitude with lite, as sufficient triall hath
beene made by those, who when they threw in one
candle lighted, &amp; another not lighted, saw the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
which was lighted swim; and the other sinke.</p>
            <p>The middle earth sea kept as streight a line vpon
the west side of the countrie, so that <hi>Reuben</hi> beeing
seated without the riuer <hi>Iordan,</hi> vpon the south,
and halfe the tribe of <hi>Manasse</hi> vppon the North,
and <hi>Gad</hi> in the middle betwixt them, the rest of
the twelue tribes or familyes (for so were the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

partes, next vnto whome were <hi>Beniamin</hi> and <hi>Dan,

North partes, and <hi>Zabulon</hi> bordered vpon them,
the other halfe tribe of <hi>Manasse</hi> enioyed the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the land, and was neighboured on the south
by <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and on the North side by <hi>Issaehar:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19856:9"/>
Leui,</hi> who had the Priesthoode, had no portion of
land in this diuision, but had out of euerie portion
certaine townes and commons about them, and in
the diuision of the countrie, one of <hi>Ioseph</hi> his sonnes
supplied his roome, and the other his owne fathers.</p>
            <p>The whole country from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Barsabee</hi> (that is
from the farthest citie north, vnto the farthest citie
south) containeth 67 myles, and the breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

places sixteene miles, in other eighteene, which
(euery mile esteemed a long houres iourney) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to bee of no great quantitie. But this small
compasse was sufficientlie recompensed with the
great commoditie which the countrye did yeelde,
for neither did the seas want great store of fish, nor
the land great plentie of fruit, both of such things as
did breed, and also of such as did bud, &amp; for proofe
of the latter two of these which were sent to take a
view of the land, while the rest of the Israelites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in the desart of <hi>Pharan,</hi> brought betwixt
them but one bunch of Grapes vpon a Leuer, and
thought that both had their full loade, yet were
they not the least of such a stocke; as people nowe
liuing are nothing like vnto them, either for strength
or stature. And <hi>Ionathan, Sauls</hi> son, by no lesse then
the losse of his life (had not the people saued him)
prooued the Oracle true, which sayde, it was a land
flowing with milke and honie. To conclude, what
soeuer the world could afford, either to please mans
sense, or delight mans mind, was within the compas
of this little portion of land, which hauing equally

round about it the East, west, north, and south, it self
like a Princesse, sat in the midst of the whole world,
to be admired by all for her beautie, and honoured
for her soueraigntie, nowe lately triumphing that it
could yet excell it selfe in bringing forth a flower,
which passed al the rest in vertue, beautie, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

            <p>This flower grew in the top of a mountain in the

The seed of this sacred flower was <hi>Iudas,</hi> sonne
to <hi>Israel,</hi> who was grandchilde to <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saacke;</hi>
the roote was <hi>Iesse,</hi> the stalke king <hi>Dauid,</hi>
and his ofspring, the bud <hi>Anna</hi> wife to <hi>Ioachim,</hi>
otherwise called <hi>Hely,</hi> or <hi>Eliachim,</hi> who hauing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
from their youth liued in plenty, aswell of
heauenly grace, as worldly goodes, onely felt this
punishment of God, and this reproch of the world,
they had no issue, for which cause <hi>Ioachim</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
according to his religious custome to offer
in the Temple, was vpbraided by the priests for his
barennes, and iudged vnworthy to encrease Gods
offeringes, whome God thought not worthy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his people, which strake so great a sorrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hart, that forthwith he forsooke his house and
friendes and liued as a man forlorne among his
shepheatdes. His wife also retyred her selfe vnto a
priuate kind of life, best fitting the humor which
now had gotten the maistery in her, yet shee fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
the Temple at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> where shee sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
all her prayers with this solemne vow, that if
it would please God to take from her that reproach
shee would consecrate her childe vnto him in the
Temple, and she was the more importunate in this
kind of deuotion, because shee had heard, that one
of like name and condition by feruent prayer, and
such like promise made vnto God, obtained her
sute, &amp; she hoped she might (if so also God would)
make her husband <hi>Ioachim</hi> as glad a Father, as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
the mother of <hi>Samuell,</hi> made her Husbande

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:19856:10"/>
How often did <hi>Ioachim</hi> also accompanie his
wandering pensiue thoughts with a little, and
that scant-settled comfort, when hee considered
that <hi>Sara</hi> when shee was past child-bearing, had a
sonne by <hi>Abraham?</hi> how often would hee increase
this comfort, with calling to minde that <hi>Rachel,</hi>
(for whose loue <hi>Iocob</hi> serued her father <hi>Laban</hi>
fourteene yeares) was numbred among the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
vntill shee brought foorth <hi>Ioseph? Sampson</hi>
would also offer himselfe many times vnto his
thoughts, whome his father <hi>Manue</hi> neuer looked
for, nor any other, because his wife was barren:
and <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet and last Iudge of Israel,
borne of a woman who was a long time barren,
comming to poore <hi>Ioachim</hi> his made, made him
thinkÃ¨ it a thing possible vnto God, to giue him
also a child, if it so pleased him; and herewithall he
refreshed sometime his spirits, vntill his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
recoyling backe vpon him, gaue him to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that <hi>Isaac</hi> was promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as
one, from whom should spring the blisse of the
whole world. <hi>Ioseph</hi> was ordained to saue the
world from being destroyed with famine, when
the earth yeelded no corne for seuen yeeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and therefore might it bee a great mystery,
that hee made a ioyfull mother, who had beene
barren before, whilst <hi>Lya Iacobs</hi> other wife, had
brought foorth seuen children: the last onely of
which being a daughter, imported a defect after
plenty, which <hi>Ioseph</hi> supplyed. And although hee
saw that the dissention betwixt the Asamones (who
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19856:11"/>
were both priests and princes did threaten vtter
ruine of their estate (being alreadie in subiection to
the Romans, and vnder the gouernement of <hi>Herod</hi>
an vsurper of the kingdome) and therefore looked
for a mightier then <hi>Samson,</hi> to deliuer them, as hee
thought from that temporall bondage, yet withall
he thought his part to be least in this worke, because
that worthie which was to make this conquest, was
to be borne of a Virgin. But neither conld he hope
for an other <hi>Samuel,</hi> because the Messias approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
neare by all accounts, would speake no more
so much by others as before hee had done but by
himselfe, vpon which discourses (his sudden ioyes
fayling him) he fell into his former griefes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
himselfe that hee was vnworthie to father
any great worthie, hee could not thinke that God
would extraordinarily open his wiues wombe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
she had beene so long a time barren for a childe,
who should not extraordinarily excell other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
wherefore hauing a conceit onely what God
of his omnipotencie could doe, and not so much
as any little hope of that which God of his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
would doe, he thought his miserie was so
great, as iustly he could complaine himselfe of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he was so iust a man, as he would not repine
against God for it.</p>
            <p>So liued <hi>Anna</hi> frequenting the temple among
saints, and <hi>Ioachim</hi> the fileds among sheep, fit places
for such as were ordained to bring foorth a Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
mother of a sacred Lambes vntill the young
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19856:11"/>
Prince, who beganne to doe some honour to his
mother, before shee was his mother, sent as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
an Embassage to her parents, to foreshewe
her comming into the worlde, as hee did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
vnto her herselfe to further his owne. For
while <hi>Ioachim,</hi> and his wife were at their woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
deuotions, a Prince appeared suddainlie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, sent from him whose meanest subiect
was no lesse then a Prince, who tolde them that
they, shoulde haue a childe, who shoulde bring
them more ioy, then the want of one had bredde
them griefe, and that the reproach they had su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayned
by an infamous barrennesse, should be most
honourably recompensed with a gracious fruit, and
therewithall departed.</p>
            <p>So straunge a message brought vnto them by a
straunger, might haue seemed incredible, had it
not beene pleasing vnto them, but being so wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
newes, they perswaded themselues that
hee carryed as much truth in his mouth, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
in his person, and was so like one who
woulde not deceyue them, that with most ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
mindes they well accepted the message, and
expected what was promised vnto them, mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
therefore at the Temple, whither both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to giue GOD thankes for what they had
heard, and embracing each other in signe of
great ioy, likely to succeede an exceeding greate
griefe, they returned home to <hi>Nazareth,</hi>
where at her appointed tyme <hi>Anna</hi> was deliuered
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19856:12"/>
of a daughter, whom her parents named <hi>Mary,</hi>
whose gracious priueledges were such, as no man
is able worthily to expresse them and her perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
so great, as the most perfect Angelles did
admire them: for to which of the Angelles euer
was it sayd as vnto her: Thou art my mother, this
day was I conceiued in thee. Let it suffice then,
that shee was to mother a sonne, who was most
louing, and therefore would, hee was of infinite
power, and therefore could not onely mende
whatsoeuer might be amisse, but preserue her also
from whatsoeuer was hurtfull: the first was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
which hee shewed vnto some of his seruants,
the second was thought a priuiledge, meete to be
bestowed onely vpon his mother, and hee was
worthie of as great prayse for preuenting a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
that it should not light where hee loued,
as if he had remouedit, after it had chanced to the
otherwise vtter perill of the patient, and no lesse to
be accounted to saue a soule, in awarding a deadly
blow, then if he had cured the wound, which
without his salue was incurable.</p>
            <p>Thinke louing children, what, mooued either
by naturall affection you would worke, or by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
loue yee could wish, if one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your intention might take effect, to honour
your mothers as well for your owne dignitie, as
for theirs, and that no doubt did this Prince for
her, toward whom hee bore as much loue and
dutie, as any child could beare vnto his mother.
After that shee was three yeeres of age, shee was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19856:12"/>
brought vnto <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and consecrated vnto
God in the temple, that famous temple, whose
building was so stately, as it might verie well bee
admired by all, but whose ornaments were so cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as they could not bee valued by any, whose
riches were so great, as they were able to enrich
the greatest Monarch of the world, but whose
scituation was so strong, as without famine or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it was not to be wonne.</p>
            <p>It was builded vpon a mountain called <hi>Morea;</hi>
where <hi>Abraham</hi> was appoynted, to sacrifice his
sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> in whose seede hee had promised all
nations should bee blessed, and vpon which the
Angell was seene putte vp his sword, who by
Gods commaundement slewe 70000. of the
Israelites, because they made not their offering
(as they were commaunded by the lawe) at what
time King <hi>Dauid</hi> caused them to bee mustered
from the one end of <hi>Palestina</hi> to the other.</p>
            <p>This mountaine was scituate in the middle of
the world, and was vnaccessible, but on the
East side, for the exceeding great steepenesse, and
ouer-hanging of the toppe thereof on all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sides. The Temple was built by King <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
sonne, and successour to King <hi>Dauid,</hi> whom
God chose to rule in place of <hi>Saul,</hi> the first King
of the Iewes, and gaue order vnto him, in what

The first part of the mountaine, where the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

as Iewes, which came for deuotion vnto
the Temple, where they might beholde right
before them Westward a goodly great porch,
which was built crosse the mountaine from the
South part thereof vnto the North, vpholden
with three rowes of pillars, which made the
walkes double, the roofe was curiously wrought,
it was of Cedar, a wood which rotteth not,
fayre to the sight, and of as profitable as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
a sent, for beeing burned, it driueth away
all venimous Serpents or killeth them, the
gates belonging to the Porch were many and
high, all of siluer and guilt: within the porch
were certaine places of good receite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the doores, where the Priestes, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appoynted for the purpose, receiued of the
people their voluntarie offerings, and of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one aboue the age of twentie yeeres, when
they were mustered for the warres halfe a sicle
(which is at the least account a groate, some say
two groates) and layde it vppe for the repayring
of the Temple. Heere liued those Priestes,
which in theyr turnes did minister in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and in these places were also seates, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Doctours did reason of the lawe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

destroyed, and another built in the roome thereof,
and the Court within it distinguished by that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19856:13"/>
name from other places of the Temple.</p>
            <p>Through this porch was it lawfull onely for the
Iewes to passe foorth by those gaets into a court,
which they accounted as an holy place, where they
did their deuotions, as wel women as men, but the
court was so diuided, as each sex had their part se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally
from other, &amp; a seueral entrance into it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but

               </gap> wall was a Cedar: At
this wall stood such singing men as belonged to
the temple, when their feast came, in which they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
musick at theyr sacrifice, and ouer the same wall
did those leane, who sometime tooke occasion to
speak vnto the Iewes: but into the court which was
diuided from them by this wall, it was not lawfull
for any to enter but the Priests, and such as serued
at the altar, or such of that tribe, as vppon some
accident onely were vnfitte for that seruice, as
by beeing blinde, or lame, or hauing such like
impediment: but although these were admitted
into the Court, yet it was not lawfull for them to
put on any apparrell belonging to their function,
but they sate together in their lay apparrell, &amp; had
part of the sacrifice which was offered, yet some do
thinke that they were not admitted into the court.
Some saye that the Nazarites were admitted
into this Court, when they hadde ended theyr
time, for the which they hadde made theyr
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19856:14"/>
vow neuer to drinke any drinke which might diste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
their brain, or eate grapes or of grapes kind, but
to serue God in a more peculiar sorte then they did
before: during which time also it was not lawfull
for them to cut their haire, but when they were to
beginne it againe. In some this vowe was perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
in others but for a certaine time, and this time
of their vow, they were to beginne againe so often
as they went to any deade body, although it were
of Father or mother, or so oft as any shoulde by
chance in their presence bee slaine: for in all such
cases a Nazarite who had liued 5. of his 6. yeares in
this profession (for some vowed for more yeares,
some for fewer as themselues would) was to cut off
his haire the same day, and the seauenth day after,
and offer a sacrifice commaunded by the law, and
beginne his time againe, which after hee had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
his haire was cut off by the priestes, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
also a sacrifice was then offered, and he restoted
to liue afterward, as he did before he made his vow.
Those men who were able, offered also 50. sickles,
the women 30. if they were not able, the priestes
were to vse their discretion.</p>
            <p>Also those women were licensed to come into
this Court, who could not by any other meanes sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their iealous husbandes, then with certaine
circumstances to offer a sacrifice in the temple, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the law, which sacrifice the priestes took
out of their hands, and offered after that they had
drunke the holy water which was giuen vnto them
to drinke, with certaine imprecations, first written
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19856:14"/>
in parchment, and read vnto them, then washed
out of the parchment into the earthen pot of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which they helde in their hande to drinke, the
curses were, that if the woman were guilty,
her belly shoulde swell with a dropsie, and her
right thigh rotte, both for a punishment to her
selfe, and an example to others, but this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was not seene vntill the tenth moneth after
that shee had drunke the water, and then if shee
were not guilty, her health did sufficientlie shew
it, and many times it chaunced that the innocents
were blessed with a young sonne. This water
had this vertue by Gods appointment, not by any
thing which was in it, for it was as other water in
it selfe, and had nothing but the ashes of a red cow
in a peculiar sort sacrificed, cast into it, by which
it was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>nted as holy water, and other thinges
also were sanctified, or purified vpon which it was
sprinckled with a branch of Isope, but beside all
these thinges mentioned in this aforesaid ceremony
some of the dust of the tabernacle or Temple,
was taken vppe from the pauement, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the potte of water, which the woman had to
drinke.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding, that some had thought
that the Nazarites and those women entered into
the Priestes Court, it is not vnlikely that they
passed no further then the gate, where all those
ceremonies might with sufficient conueniency
bee perfected, but this is not much materiall.</p>
            <p>This Court had but one gate, and it stoode
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19856:15"/>
in the east side thereof, whither the people brought
the sacrifice, and deliuered them vnto the Priests, &amp;
the wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> was made so low of purpose, which diuided
the priestes from the rest, that the people whithout
might behold the priests at their sacrifice, beside the
aduauntage which they had by the scituation of the
mountaine, which alwayes did rise the higher the
nearer the top, where only stood the temple it selfe,
so that those which were without the outmost court,
might behold both the temple, and the priests at the
altar in the court.</p>
            <p>The altar was of brasse, 20. cubits long, 20. cubits
broad, &amp; 10. cubits high, to which the priests ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon plain and euen ground, when they went
to offer sacrifice: likewise all things, which they vsed
about their sacrifice, were of brasse. There was also
a great Vessell of exceeding pure and cleare
Brasse, such as with which women sometime vsed
to dresse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selues, as now they do in glasses, which
they offered vp vnto God, when liuing in the world
they forsooke the worlde. The vessell was round,
fiue cubits high, and thirtie cubits in compasse: it
stoode vpon the hinder partes of 12. brasen oxen;
which looked three toward the east, three towarde
the west, &amp; as many toward the north and &amp; south,
here did the priests wash their hands, and their feete
at cockes before they offered sacrifice: and because
it was so great, and contained so much water (for it
helde for the most part eightie tunne, and was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of thirtie more) the Iewes called it a Sea, as
they did euerie great quantitie of water, and as it
was spent it was supplied againe by the Gabaonites,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19856:15"/>
a people which dwelt among them by this flight.</p>
            <p>When the Gabaonites heard that the Israelites
were come into the countrey, and ouerthrew all
who resisted them, they apparrelled themselues in
old clothes, tooke stale bread in their bags, &amp; sower
wine in their bottels, and came as if they had dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in some countrey farre distant from <hi>Palestina,</hi> to
craue peace and friendship of the Israelites. <hi>Iosue</hi>
and the rest of the people seeing their attire as if it
were oueworne with iournying, and their prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the stalenes thereof scantly to be eaten, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them their demand: but afterward vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that they were inhabitantes of the land, and
could not call backe their word, they deputed them
for euer after to cut &amp; carrie wood, and water, &amp; do
what drudgerie soeuer belonged vnto the temple.</p>
            <p>In this court were also 10. other vessels of brasse,
euerie one of them contayning about the quantity
of a tunne &amp; a halfe, wherin they washed the beasts
after that they were diuided to be offred, for before
they were quartered they were washed in a ponde,
which stood below the mountaine on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east
part thereof in a great market place (which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for the vse of the temple) and were brought vp
to the priestes by the Gabionites. These ten vessels
were ech of them foure cubits high, &amp; foure cubits
at the top betweene the brimmes. They were the
narrower the nearer they were to the bottome, and
set vppon broade square peeces of brasse of a great
thicknesse, &amp; very curiously wrought with image
worke: they stood vppon wheeles, which were so
perfect in all points, as if they had beene to remoue
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19856:16"/>
from place to place. Fiue of these vessels stoode
in the North part of the court, and fiue in the South
part, the brasse whereof these vessels were made,
was esteemed more precious then golde, and the
quantitie thereof belonging vnto the Temple, was
so great, as no man knew it.</p>
            <p>Close by these vessels of brasse, and by the altar,
were conueyances vnder the ground for the bloud
of the beasts, which was shed, &amp; all the water which
was spent, and it passed without any annoyance
through the mountain into a brooke called <hi>Cedron,</hi>
which ran along by the East side of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> into
the dead sea.</p>
            <p>At the west end of this court the priests ascended
by staires into a porch, which was 120. cubits high,
where stood two pillers, one vpon the right hand of
the entrance, and the other on the left hand, each of
them 18. cubits high, &amp; 12. cubits in compasse, they
were hollow, &amp; not aboue 4. fingers thicke, the head
vpon each pillar was 5. cubits high, made like vnto a
lilly, compassed with a network chaine, which went
7, times about the lilly, adorned with Pomgranates,
one hanging downe, and an other made in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
going about, to the number of almost 200. all
were of brasse, pillars, &amp; al things belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ging vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.</p>
            <p>The length of this porch, was from the south to
the north, 20. cubits, and the bredth from the east vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
the west 10. cubits: the ornaments of this porch,
are not any where mentioned what they were, more
then that it was gilded, but no doubt it was confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the house to which it did belong: for full
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19856:16"/>
west from this porch was a building 60. cubits long
from east to west, and 20. cubits broad from south to
north, it had 3. roofes one ouer another, all which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tained in height 120. cubits, and in the two
vpper roomes were kept the chiefest riches belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the temple. It was built with square white
stone to the top, which was flat, couered with cedars
(as the maner of building was in <hi>Palestina)</hi> and had
battlements round about it fiue cubits high. About
this (except the east side) were other buildings as
great as the narrownes of the mountaine would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,

               </gap>es high, whereof the lowest was 5. cubits
broade, the middle 6. the highest 7. they were all of
them seuerally fiue cubits long, and 20, cubits high,
they had windows only northward, &amp; southward,
but they were verie great, because through the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> came
the light to the middle building, which was diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in two parts, with a wall which left a roome of
20, cubits square toward the west.</p>
            <p>The outmost part had the walles couered within
with Cedar, which was carued with image work of
Cherubins, palmtrees, and other deuises, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> which
were plates of gold carued in the like maner, &amp; layd
so close as if all had bin but one peece of work, euery
image in the wood had the like in gold, so fitted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, that when al were couered with the gold, they
shewed as perfitly, as before the golde was fastened
vnto them. It had a roofe 30. cubits high of Cedar
carued after the same maner, &amp; couered with golde;
the wall next vnto the porch was 10. cubits thicke,
wherin were two double folded doores of firre-tree,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19856:17"/>
both the folde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of equall breadth, fiue cubites,
which were couered as the walles were, and so arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
made, as whether they stood wide open or
close shut, they could not be perceiued to be dor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s,
for being shut, they seemed part of the fore-front of
the wall, and being opened, they couered the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the wall, in such sort, as by no meanes it could
be seene where they hung, or where they were
ioyned. Some say that in euery one of the 4. corners
of the entry was a single doore, fiue cubits broad,
that the inside toward the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ple, when these doores
were shut, was as one wall, as well as the out-side
toward the porch. The windowes were only in the
South, &amp; north-wals verie broad within, &amp; narrow
in the out-side, right against the great windowes in
the out-buildings. Within the south part of the wal
which was ten cubits thicke, was a paire of round
turning stayres, which se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ed to all the out-buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
for they were so made, as one opened into
another, euen vnto the farthest on the same floure.
In the north part of the same wall was another paire
stayres, to goe vp into the middle roomes, which
were right ouer the temple, yet some are of opinion
that the former stairs did serue also for those rooms.</p>
            <p>In the middle of this temple, neere vnto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
roome, was an altar of Setim, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connted
the lightest, cleerest, and most beautifull
of all trees, and hath this propertie, that it neuer
rotteth, it was one cubit square, and two cubites
high, it was couered within &amp; without with gold,
and made like vnto a censor, but that at the foure
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19856:17"/>
corners for the greater ornament, were foure pillars
of the same wood, couered likewise with golde.
Some do say that this altar stood within the inmost
Temple, and that in this place was an altar made of
Cedar by <hi>Salomon,</hi> and couered with gold as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
others say, that <hi>Salomon</hi> onely couered that
of Setim with Cedar and gold, so that both were
but one altar, and stood in the middle of this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
temple. It was sometime called the golden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
somtime the altar of incense. In the south side,
toward the west, stood a candlestick of gold, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
on each side were 3. branches or armes carued, as
also the bodie thereof, with lillies, cups, and balles:
in this candle-sticke were seuen lights maintained
day and night, the snuffers, the vessell that held the
oyle, that which receiued the snuffings, &amp; whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
els belonged vnto the candlestick, were of gold.
In the north side, right against the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>dlestick, was a
table of Setim 2. cubits long, one cubit broad, and a
cubit &amp; a half high, it was couered top &amp; sides with
golde, &amp; round about vpon the top of the edges of
the table, were two crowns of gold, the vndermost
was wrought, the vppermost was plaine. Vpon this
table euery Sabaoth day were set 12. new loaues of
vnleuened bread, euery loafe of 8. pound weight, 6.
in a heap, one vpon another, &amp; were called bread <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>f
proposition, because they were alwaies sette by the
Iewes in Gods sight in the temple, to acknowledge
that they liued by him, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the tops of those heaps
stood 2. cups of gold, full of most pure incense, &amp; at
the end of the weeke the bread was taken away for
the priests vse, &amp; fresh set in their places, but al the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19856:18"/>
incense was burned. Heere also were tenne other
tables, little worse then that, fiue stood in the
North side, and fiue in the South side, whereon
stood a hundred cuppes of gold for the Priests to
drinke in: also here were tenne other candlesticks
of gold, which stood in the like order: before the
doore of this temple hung a vayle of image
worke, in foure most liuely and rich colours,
white, scarlet, redde, and skie-colour.</p>
            <p>The inmost building diuided with a wall full
west from the former temple, was twentie cubits
square, and differed nothing from it, but onelie
that the doores were of oliue, and the pauement
of Cedar, but couered with golde as the other
were: it was accounted the holyest place in all
the temple, and no man might enter into it, but
the high Priest, nor hee but once in the yeere.</p>
            <p>In the middle of this temple stood the Arke,
which God taught <hi>Moyses</hi> to make in the wildernes,
after hee had led the Israelites out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through
the redde sea dry-foote, at what time <hi>Pharao</hi> King
of <hi>Egypt</hi> pursuing them, was drowned, and all
his armie. It was made of <hi>Setim,</hi> two cubites and a
halfe long, one cubite and a halfe broade, and so
high: it was plated within and without with most
pure gold, at euery corner was a ring of gold so
bigge, as on each side of the Arke a strong barre of
<hi>Setim</hi> couered with gold, might go through them,
for the conuenient carriage thereof, when it was
remooued. The couer of the Arke was plaine and
of fine gold, so long and broade as the Arke was,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19856:18"/>
vpon which stoode two Cherubins of gold with
their winges spread from one end of the couer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the other, and they stood as if they were one lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
toward the other. This couer to the Arck
they called a propitiatorie, because from thence did
God promise mercy vnto his people, when he was
sued vnto by the high priestes: Within this Arke
were the two Tables of the law, which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
carued in a stone, and gaue to <hi>Moses.</hi> Here was
also a golden pot with Manna, which was the onely
food, by which the Israelites liued after they came
forth of <hi>Egypt</hi> for the space of 40 years, it was of that
qualitie (as some say) that in the eating, what deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
meate soeuer the eater desired, hee found the
tast thereof in his mouth, certaine it is, that it was a
most pleasant food, and although it would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
aboue one day vncorrupted (except onelie
when they gathered to keepe for their Sabboath
dayes victuall) yet not without a speciall miracle it
continued in this pot many hundred yeares. <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
his rod was here likewise kept, which was set in
the tabernacle with twelue other, by the florishing
of which, his election to the Priesthood was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
vnto the people, and he preferred before the
other twelue princes which stoode in contentiou
with him. In this Temple stoode also two other
Cherubins of Oliue couered with gold 10. cubites
high, their winges spread in bredth euery one fiue
cubits they looked both towarde the east, on each
side of the arke stoode one, so that they filled the
whole bredth of the Temple with their winges, &amp;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19856:19"/>
couered with them the toppe of the Arke. The
dores stoode alwaies open, and before the entrance
hong such a vaile as hung before the dores of the
outmost Temple.</p>
            <p>Foure hundred yeares, and more continued this
Temple in this glorie, vntill <hi>Sedechias</hi> (who was
left king of the Iewes by <hi>Nabuchadonosor</hi> king of the
<hi>Chaldees)</hi> rebelled against him (encouraged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
by mistaking the Oracle that hee should nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be slain in fight, nor see <hi>Babilon)</hi> for which cause
<hi>Nabuchadonoser</hi> pressing the Cittie with famine, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him &amp; his children with others to flie by night,
and vnderstanding so much afterward by his espials
followed them, and tooke them in the chase, and
when they were brought before him, hee slew <hi>Sede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi>
his children in their Fathers sight, then put
out his eyes, and led him captiue to <hi>Babilon,</hi> whether
before hee had carried <hi>Ioachim,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conias,</hi>
who was nephew to this <hi>Sedechias,</hi> and king
of the Iewes, and had yeelded himselfe vnto <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godonosor.</hi>
The victorie obtained against <hi>Sedechias,</hi>
the <hi>Chaldees</hi> returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and tooke the
spoile of the Temple, and afterward burned it down
to the ground, for which cause and other abuses
offred by <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> and his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, vnto those

eating nothing but what they eate, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
any other defence against hard weather, then
what they had and his grandchild in short time lost
his life, and left his kingdome to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:19856:19"/>
who setting the Iewes at libertie, gaue them
leaue to build their Temple againe, but not in that
ample maner as before it was, being enformed by
those who were bad neighbours to the Iewes, that
the maiesty and strength thereof would encourage
them to reuolte from their obedience, but neither
had they been able to perform it if they might haue
had licence, hauing beene in captiuity seauenty
yeares, and spoiled of all their substance, yet had
they to helpe them vntil it was built, thirty talentes
yearely allowed them by king <hi>Darius,</hi> whereof 20.
were for the setting it vp, and tenne for their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and all the vessels which were remaining of
the spoile, which <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> carried out of the
first temple, were restored vnto them.</p>
            <p>Being this second time builte it continued aboue
fiue hundred yeares, but it was many times in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of vtter ruine, as by <hi>Alexander</hi> the greate king
of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who in his voiages in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
all those east partes of the world, came with
a full resolution to spoile <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the temple,
although at the sight of <hi>Iaddus</hi> the high Priest, atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his priestly ornaments, he altered his purpose
and allighted from his horse, and worshipped him
on his knees, saying that in the same attire God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
vnto him, and encouraged him in his valou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
enterprise. It was also in daunger, when <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
(called <hi>Epiphanes)</hi> did tyranize ouer them,
for they were oppressed sometime by one, somtime
by an other, and in the end became subiect to the
Romaines, who were contented they shold obserue
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19856:20"/>
the rights of their law, but appoynted <hi>Herod</hi> a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to bee their king, yet was he much worse wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

his father, but hee was willing in what hee
could to win them vnto him, and for that cause hee
circumcised himselfe, and became a Iew in professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who was an Idumean by birth, &amp; framed a new
temple of square white stone, some 25. cubits long,
some 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>. with breadth, &amp; thicknes correspondent,
which appeared a farre off like vnto a mountain of
snow, where it was not couered with gold, &amp; when
it was al framed, he pulled down the other, &amp; set vp
this, for the Iewes would not suffer him to destroy
the old temple, vntill they see a new readie to bee
erected in the place thereof, which was so goodly a
thing, that it was reuerenced by the heauens, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
fell any raine in the day time, while men were at
worke about it, but onely in the night, some small
showres, lest their worke should be hindered.</p>
            <p>It was much bigger then was that, which <hi>Salomon</hi>
built, for the people in time had enlarged the
mountaine with earth, which they raised 400. cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
high, but <hi>Herod</hi> altogether obserued the same
order in the temple &amp; the courts, sauing that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
one court round about the temple, which
was curiously paued with all manner of rich stone,
and compassed it with double walkes, diuided with
white marble pillars, one stone in a pillar, 25. cubits
hie, out of which were some gates opening toward
euerie quarter. In the east part hung such spoyles as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19856:20"/>
the Iews had taken from barbarous nations, &amp; dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
vnto the temple, where also <hi>Herod</hi> placed such
as himselfe had taken from the Arabians, but in the
south side were the principall walkes, for they were
diuided with such pillars as the other were, but
where the other were double, in this side they were
triple, and the middle much higher then the other
two, yet all made so stately, as it was a wonder to
behold them, and into this court might any who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
enter. He made also the entrance out of one
court into another with stayres, for out of this court
the Iewes did ascend fourteene steps round about
the temple, vnto a plaine, which contained ten cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
in breadth, from which they ascended againe
fiue steps, to come to the porch wherein were the
gates, by which they entred into their court, which
they called holy, and into which no Gentiles might
come vppon paine of death, and because no man
should pleade ignorance, being deprehended past
his limits, this law was written both in Greeke and
Latin, and hung in a table at the foote of the lower
stayres, that all the Gentiles might reade it. <hi>Euerie
Alien which shall presume to enter into the holy place,
lette him die,</hi> which lawe was so straightly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
that the Romanes, who were their rulers,
dared not to goe any farther then the first Court,
but neither could the Iewes enter into it, which
were not pure according vnto their Lawes.</p>
            <p>To this Court were foure gates in the North
side, and foure in the South side<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, couered
with siluer and gold, as also the posts ouer the gates,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19856:21"/>
and on which they hung, but two gates which
stood in the East, one right before the other, farre
exceeded them all: by the first whereof, entred
both men and women into the porch, and from
thence by two priuate doores, into the place allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selues, &amp; this was called the great gate of
the Temple, by the other onely men vsually did
enter into their Court: and this gate was of brasse;
called brasse of Corinth, a confused mettal of gold,
siluer, and other mettals, of which they of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
framed their Idols, and with which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
their temples melted altogether, when the
Romanes tooke the Citie, and burnt it downe to
the ground. This gate for the woorth and curious
workmanship aboue the rest, was called the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
gate, and was so great that 20. men could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shut it.</p>
            <p>To this gate the men ascended by fifteene steps,
and entred into their court, which was diuided
from the court where the Priestes offred sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
as in the first Temple, but although it
were not lawfull for the women to passe through
the beautifull gate, yet they might come vnto it, to
deliuer vp what they offered.</p>
            <p>Heere did <hi>Ioachim</hi> deliuer vp his charge, and
dedicate his childe to the seruice of God, and
<hi>Anna</hi> his wife was not a little proude, when shee
had wherewith to performe her promise, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with no lesse ioy then <hi>Ioachim,</hi> shee fulfilled
her vow, and made a present vnto God of the
first fruits of her wombe, for many places were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19856:21"/>
prepared in the Temple for such purpose (se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
from the Priests and Leuits, who lay there
while they performed theyr weekely function,
for whome, during the time, it was not lawfull
to drinke any wine, nor accompanie with their
wiues, much lesse might they bee in continuall
daunger of committing sinne, such puritie and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie
was required of those, which ministred at
theyr altar) and in those places liued many, both
young maidens, and graue matrons, such, (no
doubt) as hauing forsaken the world, and the pride
thereof, continued at the doore of the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
(before the Temple was built) in fasting and
prayer, yet was this difference among them, that
the yonger sort might after their religious educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
bee giuen in marriage by the Priestes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the accustomed manner, but the elder
women continued there vntill theyr dying day,
as appeareth by <hi>Anna</hi> the daughter of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is manifest also, that those places were not
open indifferently to all commers, because that
<hi>Iosabe</hi> wife vnto <hi>Ioiada</hi> the high Priest, and sister
vnto <hi>Ochesias</hi> king of the Iewes stole away <hi>Ioas,</hi>
who was sonne to <hi>Ochesias,</hi> and hidde him and
his nurse (for as yet hee was an infant) sixe yeeres
in the Temple, lest that <hi>Athalia (Ochesias</hi> his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
should also murther him, as shee had many
of the kings linage, because shee would both bee
sole Queene, and rule the more securely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:19856:22"/>
But now the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ple is not a secret receptacle for <hi>Ioas,</hi>
who after should bee king of the Iewes, but it is a
stately habitacle for <hi>Marie,</hi> who afterward should be
the mother of God, and therefore inferiour to none
who was no better then a creature. Both censors,
and sents, altars and sacrifice, golde, siluer, and setim,
and whatsoeuer was valued precious in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
was nothing woorth in comparison of this
virgin. A person worthie so noble a house, and a
most rich house enriched by the presence of so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a personage. A common thing it was among the
Iewes to lay vp in their temple in a dangerous times
their chiefest Iewels, but now the temple is become
Gods chiefest treasure-house, and a defence for a
more sacred temple. That temple was built by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
and this by a greater then <hi>Salomon,</hi> that was
dayly ransacked, yea and sometime raised to the
earth. This dayly rose vntill it reached aboue the
heauens. The treasure of that was such, as it allured
men to vice: but the treasure of this was such, as it
prouoked all to vertue. And it was so much more
excellent in all poynts then the temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi>
by how much it is a more worthy thing to be Gods
mother, then his manour<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> although also she wanted
not this title of honour, which euery faithfull soule
is sayd to haue, when it is called Gods temple: for
being pronounced full of grace, no doubt she was
accounted also the chiefest of Gods temples in that
degtee.</p>
            <p>In that temple was the arke, wherin were kept the
tables of the law, which God deliuered to <hi>Moses;</hi> but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19856:22"/>
she was temple and arke, wherein was the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
himselfe to bee included. There also was kept
part of that Manna, which fed the Israelites in the
desart; but now is she presented in the temple, who
was to keepe a bread of so much more perfection, As
Manna was but a shadow of bread in comparison of
it, and to counteruaile <hi>Aaron</hi> his rod, a rod of
more fauour, then was that which King <hi>Ahasuerus</hi>
held out to Queene <hi>Hester,</hi> and which hath giuen
more incouragement to demaund whatsoeuer wee
want, and hope to obtaine it,</p>
            <p>She remained in the temple vntill shee was four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeares of age in praier and meditation, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as much lowlines in her mind as chastitie in her
thoughts, neuer lesse idle then when she was alone,
and yet neuer weary of her company: for in that she
seemed afterward to be troubled onely at the angels
maner of salutation, it appeareth she was as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with such a presence as others, to whome
(as infallible true hystories affirme) it was nothing
so dainty as now to vs to see an angel) otherwise, no
doubt, he had manifested himselfe vnto her, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had done elsewhere, when he told <hi>Zacharias</hi>
that he was <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and one of those, which stoode
continually before God.</p>
            <p>Nowe began the Priestes to thinke vpon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
her, but they could not thinke on any who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
they iudged worthie to match with her: shee made
them acquainted with her vow, to remaine perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
a virgin, and they were afraid to put her in
daunger of breaking it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:19856:23"/>
The Scribes, who were interpreters of the lawe,
and other of the same sect, but of more subtile lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and therfore also differing from them in name,
and were called Pharisies, vowed many times vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie,
or chastitie for certaine yeares, which they
obserued most strictly: and for that purpose (as at
all other times, so especially at these) they neither
tooke much ease, nor eate much meate, but day and
night applied themselues wholy to prayer. Also
some of the Esseni (which were diuided into foure
sects) liued all their life time virgins, but neuer vntil
this time did any of the other sexe professe such a
kinde of life, which troubled the Priestes the more,
yet in the ende being resolued by diuine inspiration
to bestow her, they found out one of the same tribe
of which shee was, who although his auncesters
also had beene Princes of the Iewes, yet was hee
but a poore Carpenter, and to him they gaue what
was most excellent in the whole worlde, choosing
for her safetie, rather a well disposed, then a wealthie
husbande, <hi>Ioseph</hi> (for so was the Carpenter called)
receyuing her at the Priestes handes, was according
to the custome of the countrie espoused vnto her,
at a solemne meeting of their friendes, which was
done by the taking of their names, by such as were
in authoritie for the purpose, but afterward her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
kept her at home vntill the day came of her
marryage: during which season, they were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as husbande and wife, and as fast linked, as if
they had beene marryed. And her sonne before
hee became her sonne, wrought maruailouslie to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19856:23"/>
her contentment in <hi>Ioseph,</hi> least at any time her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie
shoulde haue beene in ieopardie, for who
would haue iudged her to haue meant to remaine a
Maide, which see her take a mate, her selfe beeing
of tender yeares, and her husbande no olde man:
but <hi>Ioseph</hi> (hauing the same minde that shee had
before hee marryed her, or perswaded by her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hee was marryed, as shee was enformed (no
doubt) by him who wrought it) that shee shoulde
preuaile with him in that matter, did neuer so much
as purpose to preiudice her vowe, which shee
had made of perpetuall virginitie, but being moste
truly and properly her husband, he resolued to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
himselfe onely as a most constant, faithful, and
chastly louing friend.</p>
            <p>By this meane was the Enchaunter deceyued,
taking her for no pure maiden being marryed, and
the worlde satisfied afterwarde, when shee was
with childe, which else woulde haue iudged her
to haue done amisse. Thus did the Prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
from his aduersarie what was doone, and
left him to iudge as hee lysted of that, which
was neuer doone, and as of himselfe the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
was not of power to enter into the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
thoughtes; so was hee also restrayned, that
his knowledge might deceyue him in her deedes.
And although that hee coulde neuer perceyue
that euer shee gaue consent to anye such act, yet
was shee of such a nature, as hee knewe shee
might, and being maried, he thought it so likelie a
matter as he hoped he should not by her in any sort
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19856:24"/>
be restrayned in his malice, yet because he knew
the time approached neere, of which had beene
many prophesies of the end of that wickednes hee
had wrought, he could doe no lesse then feare, and
withall, bee verie watchfull: but the yong Prince
beeing more wise then the other was wilie, and
more cunning to conceile, then the other was to
conceiue, gaue him leaue by some accidents,
to coniecture his neerest miseries, but yet kept
him altogether vncertaine of the cheefest miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>The Virgin being in her fathers house, retyred
in her chamber, as shee vsed to bee, a Prince of
the Emperour his court came vnto her, either one
of those which was wont to visit her, or some of
higher qualitie, whom shee was most ioyfull to
see: but when shee heard him salute her after an
accustomed manner, shee beganne to bee afrayd,
and to tremble for feare. Hayle full of grace (saith
the Embassadour) our Lord is with thee, blessed
art thou among women. And how could shee,
that was mother of all humilitie, not blush to bee
told that shee was full of grace? howe could shee
choose but bee astonished to heare him, who, or
his like was woont alwayes before to speake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but truth, now say that, which she thought
was verie farre from the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>uth: shee doubted not,
but that her Lord of his kindnesse was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with her; but shee could not resolue her
selfe that shee was so gracious a creature in his
sight, as to bee saluted by this name <hi>Full of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19856:24"/>
Grace:</hi> shee was woont to bee called <hi>Marie,</hi> to
which name shee neuer feared to aunswere, but
now that shee heareth one called <hi>full of Grace,</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
would haue assured her, that the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
meant some other than her, but that shee
neither had any thought of any others being in
place, nor the Prince any power to fixe his eye, but
vpon her. Here therefore made she a stop, and stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vpon this salutation: for easily would she haue
consented, that the woman was most blessed aboue
all other women, who was full of grace, but her
humble thoughts would not graunt that shee was
this woman. Whereupon falling into a verie deepe
meditation, whereunto this vnwoonted salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should tend, shee changed her colour so often,
as her imagination varyed, making with her, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her, which the Embassadour perceiuing,
hee awaked her as it were out of some trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
dreame, and soluing all her doubts, sayd thus
vnto her.</p>
            <p>Feare not <hi>Mary,</hi> for thou hast found grace with
God, behold thou shalt conceiue in thy wombe,
and shalt beare a sonne, and thou shalt cal his name
<hi>Iesus,</hi> hee shall bee great, and shall bee called the
sonne of the most high, and our Lord God shall
giue him the seate of <hi>Dauid</hi> his father, and hee
shall raigne in the house of <hi>Iacob</hi> for euer, and of
his kingdome shall bee no end.</p>
            <p>When shee perceiued, beeing nowe named,
that shee was the partie to whome the embassage
was to bee deliuered, and was also perswaded that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19856:25"/>
her Lord had that care of her, that hee would
not suffer her easily to bee deceiued, either with
any fayned shewe, of that which was not, or
false promise of that which could not bee: with
a modest boldnesse shee demaunded of him, how
so great a mysterie should bee wrought in her,
being a thing well knowne vnto his Lord, and
her, that shee did not knowe any man: which
shee spake with that constancie in her gesture,
and shamefulnesse in her countenance, as the
Embassadour might very well coniecture, that as
she did not mistrust his message, so shee meant not
to preiudice her vow she had made, of perpetuall
keeping her selfe a maiden, and therefore he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
her this aunswere. The holy Ghost shall come
vpon thee, and the power of the most high shall
ouer-shadow thee, and therefore that holy one
which shall bee borne of thee, shall bee called the
sonne of God, and behold, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> thy cosin, shee
also hath conceiued a sonne in her old age, &amp; this

no worke shall bee impossible to God.</p>
            <p>This Virgin, who had profited so much in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as nowe shee was become peerelesse, seeing
right wel, that without any blemish to her honour,
shee might entertaine such loue, as was offered
her by him, who was of so high renowne, as shee
might presume hee would not, and so absolute, as
she might be throughly perswaded hee could not
doe any thing, whereby either repentance should
fall to him, or any shame redound to her, to satisfie
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19856:25"/>
the expectation of the Emperour, his sonne, and
all the Princes attendant on them, which seemed
at this time to mind nothing else then her answere:
shee yeelded her selfe to her Lords will, and with
more humilitie then <hi>Abigail</hi> to king <hi>Dauids</hi> mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
(when hee sent to demaund her consent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him in marriage) shee sayde vnto this Prince
Embassadour, Behold the handmaid of my Lord,
bee it done to me according to thy word.</p>
            <p>Her consent obtained, the Embassadour gaue
her a farewell mixed with such ioy and reuerence,
as if hee had beene loth to detract time to be gone
with so great good newes, and yet could not but
stay a while to doe his dutie, but being of that agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that hee could passe so much space in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

himselfe wirh that speede, that in a trice hee both
encreased a ioy in the place where hee was, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

Whereupon Loue, who is impatient of delaye,

            <p>But although others lost themselues in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of this diuine mysterie, the Virgin no
doubt was so perfectly instructed in it, that shee
sound as much knowledge, as she had felt comfort,
and her comfort was the more, because her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
was so great, and remembring that the higher
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19856:26"/>
shee was in calling, the more lowly best beseemed
her to bee in her carriage, shee did alwayes with
most humble thoughts attend vpon high conceits,
neither thinking at any time too well of herselfe,
for that shee should mother so worthy a prince, nor
yet so vnwary as to giue any cause, why from thence
forth hee should disdaine her to bee his mother.</p>
            <p>Among other her comforts, she remembred what
the Embassador had said vnto her of her cosen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
whome before shee loued, but now she lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to see, and if the wayes presented themselues
in her imagination very long, her desire looked to
bee preferred, which was in heart also very great, &amp;
and the time of the yeare being both fit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

greatest renown, because it was sometime the kings

such men (or rather monsters) as neither eye coulde

            <p>There was so sweete a consorte in her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce,
and so exquisite a concorde in her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that there was no need of other musicke to
grace her song: the eare had so full an obiect of

those which heard her, and see her as they had
done impiously to haue taken her for a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse,
so had they done iniuriously, if they had
taken her for lesse then the mother of God.</p>
            <p>But while she and her cosen entertained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable
ioyes by these their mutuall and most
kinde greetinges, <hi>Zacharias</hi> came with as hartie

as his dumbnesse would permit him. A
sharpe pennance did <hi>Zacharias</hi> endure, but it was
deserued, because hee knewe not how to doe any
wrong who enioyned it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Zachartas</hi> was a priest and husbande to
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> honoured among the Iewes for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse,
and highly esteemed by God for his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
punished with a momentarie losse, because
hee was thought worthie of an eternall gaine:
for while hee ministred in the Temple, and made
his prayers for a childe vnto him, who coulde
open the wombe of a barren and aged woman,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19856:29"/>
an Angell appeared vnto him at the right hande
of the Altar of incense, first frighting him with
his presence, then encouraging him with a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
message, and tolde him, that his wife <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
should beare him a sonne, whome he should
call <hi>Iohn,</hi> in whose natiuitie hee and many other
shoulde reioyce, with so many circumstances of
so great importance, that <hi>Zacharias</hi> thought it a
thing impossible.</p>
            <p>Whereuppon the Angell meaning to assure
him of his message, shewed vnto him that he was
<hi>Gabriel,</hi> and sent vnto him from God, to tell
him these good tidinges, but because of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulitie,
hee shoulde remaine dumbe vntill
the day came wherein all these things should bee
done, and therewithall departed from him. But
<hi>Zacharias</hi> presently founde by experience the
signe was too true, which was giuen him of the
childbirth, for comming abroade among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who had expected him aboue the vsuall time
allotted for that kind of worship, hee saluted them
with signes, &amp; not being able to speake vnto them,
they all vnderstoode that hee had seene some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>This notwithstanding hee continued still in
the Temple, vntill the dayes of his office were
expired, for all the Priestes did minister in their
turnes, which being performed, they rested
three and twentie weekes before they returned
to doe their function. This order did king Dauid
institute to auoyde a confusion, likely to growe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19856:30"/>
among them, by reason of the multitude of them,
for sending for all the priestes which were in his
time, and finding foure and twentie principall
families, he appointed that euerie familie should
serue in the temple in their seuerall weeke, the order
to be euer after kept, according to the lots then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to be cast, which course also the Leuites ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
which serued the priests: and because <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi>
was the chiefe priest of his family, many call
him absolutely the high priest, wheras among them
were 23. more of equall dignitie, &amp; no one of them
greater then an other, as appeareth by that no one
of them was preferred before the other, but euerie
familie serued in the temple, according as their lot
fell vnto them, and <hi>Zacharias</hi> was of the familie of
<hi>Abias,</hi> to whom fell the eight lot: but aboue all these
was one chiefe priest, to whome onely belonged
the chiefest office in the temple, which was to enter
into the holyest part thereof, and this was but once
in the yeare, that is to say, the tenth day of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
moneth, they accounted the first (for the
most part) part of our March, and part of Aprill: &amp;
the length of their moneth to the first appearing of
the new moone. The high Priest when he entred
that place, put on a paire of breeches made with
twisted silke (for when the law ws first giuen, men
did weare no breeches) and they were so made for
strength, but they were of most pure white silke, &amp;
exceeding fine.</p>
            <p>They were tyed fast vnder his nauell, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to his knees: then he put on a garment of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19856:30"/>
same stuffe, which was open in the breast, and back,
but to be made fast with hookes of gold, the sleeues
were straite vnto his armes, it reached to his feete
without pleite or fold, it was girt vnto him next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his bodie, a little beneath his armepittes, with a
girdle foure fingers broad, but hollow like vnto the
skinnes which Snakes doe cast, in it were manie
flowers and percious stones, wrought in red, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
skie-coloured, and white, so liuely as if they had
beene set, not wrought: the ground was white, and
it hung downe to his feete from the knot where it
was tied. Vpon his head, he wore a Mytre wrought
with white silke, which was tied behind with a silke
ribband, that it should not fall off from his heade,
when he stirred about the sacrifice. It was made like
vnto a halfe Moone, and not so high, but that some
part of his head was seene toward the crowne, and
round about it were little ribbandes sowed one part
of the one ouer some part of the other, but so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
as no man could perceyue where the needle
was vsed.</p>
            <p>Thus attired did hee goe into that part of the
temple, which was called the holy of holies, with
the bloud of a calfe, which hee sprinkled vpon the
couer of the arch, and also the bloud of a Goat. Then
comming foorth he laid his handes vpon the head
of another Goat, confessing before God all the sins
of the people, and praying that the punishment due
vnto them might light vpon that Goat, he caused it
to be caried away into some desart, and there to bee
left. After this ceremonie, he put of those vestments,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19856:31"/>
and washed himselfe. Then was he attyred againe,
adding to his former ornaments an other coat of sky
colour, which was made open in the breast, &amp; in the
backe, and where the priest was to put foorth his
armes, without any sleeues, and a welt of the same
stuffe was sowed round vnto the edges where it was
open: it reached downe vnto his ancles, and was
wrought neare vnto the lower part, with pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
in white, red sky-colour, and purple silke, in
such order, as betwixt euery pomegranate did hang
a little bell of gold, to the number as some say of 72.
Ouer this coat he wore a garment, which came no
farther then vnto his middle, it hung halfe before,
and halfe behind, it was open in the shoulders, but
the sleeues were close to his arme, and where it was
open vnder the arme, it was to be fastned, by being
sowed together, or with buttons. This kind of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
did not onely Priests, and Leuites weare, but
whosoeuer applied themselues in any peculiar wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, but with this difference, that their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was onely wrought with silke, without any
other ornament. And that which the high Priest
did weare, was wrought also with golde, and had
vpon each shoulder, where it was open a precious
stone called an Onix, which is transparent, and of a
mixed colour betweene white and redde. In these
stones were engrauen the names of the twelue sons
of <hi>Iacob,</hi> sauing that in place of <hi>Leui,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> were
two of <hi>Iosephs</hi> sonnes, <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Manasses:</hi> for <hi>Leui</hi>
hauing the Priesthoode, and offering sacrifice, was
a sufficient representation of that familie before
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19856:31"/>
God, for which cause principally were the others
engrauen in the stones, and to bee worne at that
time. These stones were set in golde, and in place of
buttons to close this habit on the shoulders: but the
stone which was on the right shoulder, as often as
the high Priest offered sacrifice, did aboue his
woont, and aboue his nature shine so bright, that
it might bee seene a great way off, of which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
the reason may bee, because on that shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
were the names of the sixe eldest, among the
which was <hi>Iudas,</hi> from whome he should spring,
who should bee a light to the whole worlde. This
habite was girt vnto him with a girdle of white silke
wrought with diuerse colours, and intermingled
with golde, the edges whereof were conueied into
pipes of gold, and this also hung down before. This
habit they called an Ephod, and it had a farre more
costly ornament fastened vnto it. It had a place
in the middle of the breast without any worke,
about a spanne square, to supplie which, was a
peece of the same stuffe double wrought, because
it shoulde bee of good strength, for in it were set
twelue precious stones, in euery one of which were
the twelue names aboue mentioned, engrauen, they
were set three in a ranke, so that they made foure
rankes in the peece. In the first order was set<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e
a Sardius, a Topaze, and an Emerauld: in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
a Carbuncle, a Saphire, and a Iasper: in the
thirde, an Anthracite, an Achate, and an Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thist:
in the fourth, a Chrysolite, an Onix, and a
Berill.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:19856:32"/>
This peece thus beset with precious stones dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wrought (as is saide for strength, because no
doubt these stones were very great containing in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
one of them twelue names) was fastened in
the breast of the Ephod, with foure ringes of golde,
which were in the foure corners on that side, which
was next vnto the Ephod, in which were also foure
other rings of gold, to which it was tyed with a skycolour
silke lace, but in the outside of the peece (in
the vpper part thereof) were two greater ringes of
gold, one in one corner, and another in the other
corner, through each of which rings went a chaine
of gold to the shoulder, through hollow pipes of
gold, and was fastened by both the endes thereof
to the vpper part of the Ephod in the backe, which
for the purpose had twoo hookes of gold sette in
it: and this little square rich peece they called <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,</hi>
wherein they sayd was also put knowledge
and truth, which was no more, then that the Priest
putting it on him, when he put on the Ephod, and
demaunding of God the euent of things to come,
or the truth of things which were doubtfull, he was
so assisted by Gods goodnesse, as he obtained that
for which hee prayed, and could giue a right iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof: by this also when they went to
warres, they alwaies knewe what successe they
should haue, for if they should haue the victorie,
the precious stones would giue an extraordinary
glimse and brightnesse, to the great encouragement
of the people, and although others putting on their
Ephod, did often demaunde of God the euent of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19856:32"/>
things to come, and had aunswere, yet none was
so particularly ordained for this purpose by God,
as this, neither was there so manifest a certaiuty, as
was by this, for by the glistering of this, all the
people might also diuine, without any doubt of
their good or euill successe, for which cause the
Grecians vsed to call it an Oracle.</p>
            <p>Vpon his head hee wore a mitar like vnto the
other, but it was couered al ouer with a skie-colour
needle-worke, and in the fore-part thereof, hung
plate of gold somewhat ouer his fordhead, tyed
with a skie-coloure silke ribband behind his head,
in which plate of gold were engrauen words of this
signification, The holy of the Lord, but the word
which signified the Lord, was expressed with these
foure caracters, by which no man euer knew howe
to spell it rightly, or at the least were afrayde to

that same day at the altar which stood in the
Court, which was called the Priestes court, and at
all other times when they offered sacrifice, and the
reason why hee did not in this glorious attire enter
into the most holy place, was because hee entred
at that time to sacrifice for the sinnes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for which hee went in, in a more humble
sort, and all the people that daye did fast; but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19856:33"/>
afterwarde in token of ioy, that all were clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from their sinnes, hee attired himselfe as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
and proceeded to a second sacrifice in the
place, where the inferiour Priestes did offer euerie
day, according to the order taken for the purpose,
but their ornaments were no other then such, as
the high Priest did weare, when hee entred into
the holyest place of all holyes. This dayly sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
which they offred in the Court, was a lambe a
yeere olde or vnder, which was without spot (that
is, without any deformitie or disease either in skin
or limbe) with somewhat more then a pecke of
flower, a pottle of wine, and as much of the best
oyle, and this was offered morning and euening,
beside all other sacrifices whatsoeuer, or whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they were offered, and this was the second of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Priests in the Temple, the third was
to change the bread of proposition, which stood
in the Temple next vnto the Court Westward,
which was but once in a weeke, the fourth was to
trimme the lampes in the golden candlesticke in
the same place, and this was also doone morning
and euening. The fift was to offer vp incense at

he who had sette a locke vpon his lips, vntil his child

as his heart had often felt paine for his incredulitie,
and not haue let the father make so many dumbe

open signes of their vnspeakable mirth, but his word

that in his mind, which he could not
vtter as hee would with his mouth, and because she
was one, whose company could not bee too much
desired, it was no small corasiue vnto him, that he
could not giue her that entertainement which shee
deserued, but both hee and his wife did their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour

neither the place, nor the companie were able to

their forwardnesse with as friendly, but humble

            <p>The dayes of her abode with them, seemed to
them both too short, their discourses euery day
waxing sweeter then other, and the nightes were
iudged too long, although they promised still
they would bee shorter, which both cut off their
talke too soone, and kept them too long asunder, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
very ample and pleasing themes to delate vpon

            <p>
               <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would discourse vnto her coosen, how
the Angell appeared to <hi>Zacharias</hi> in the Temple,
what hee promised, and how farre forth his promise
was performed, with hope that he which punished
an others false heart in his tongue, would not haue
his owne tongue blemished with any falshoode, for
no doubt <hi>Zacharias</hi> did seeke by all meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to animate his amated wife, when hee sawe her
in her dumpes for his dumbnesse, and for such
cause woulde not sticke to write<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that at the least
in Tables, which hee coulde not vtter with his

lesson, vntill shee had perfectly learned his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
misfortunes, and perceyuing howe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
his incredulitie had displeased the Angell, shee
often intimated to her Coosen, as at her first mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
howe blessed shee was, who had beleeued the

signed with her coosens silence, required
her with as straunge a storie in respect of the maner,

some notice thereof, yet was shee very
farre from the knowledge of many circumstances
belonging therevnto. Entring therefore into the
discourse of her annunciation, she vsed few wordes,

how in the end she sped, beside infinite other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which continually came into her minde, both
of her sonnes greatnesse in himselfe, and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
toward others: for being his mother, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not without iust cause iudging herselfe to haue
the second right in him, she thought it fit she should
giue place to no more then one, in the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

those poore women in the highest of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
that they might talke of perchance, and
feele, but could neither see, nor here those sacred
babes, which made them both so blessed mothers,
yet did they often embrace, and kisse them in their
mindes, whome they were sure they had inclosed
within their sanctified wombs.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Elizabeth</hi> whose time was at hande, was
somewhat comforted, and the blessed virgin when
shee espied her sonnes harbinger, was the more
contented, the one seeing her ioy present, the

other knowing hers not to bee farre distant. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
some do doubt whether she staid her coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens
deliuerie, because it was the custome that
Maydens shoulde not bee present at womens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
yet the house contayning more roomes
then one, woulde affoorde her another, vntill her
Coosen were deliuered: and it is not likely shee
woulde take so long a iourney, stay there so long,
and then leaue her kinswoman whome shee so
entirely effected, when she shoulde haue most need
of her comfort, as being in labour in her olde age,
with her first childe, whose worthinesse was such,
as his father not beleeuing it, was bereaued of the
vse of his tongue, he by her presence sanctified in
his mothers wombe, and in whose natiuitie it was
foretolde by the Oracle, that not onely his parents,
but many other also shoulde reioyce. And although
a diuine Hystorie dooth mention the Virgins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,

yet dooth it not say it was before her trauaile. And

of this visitation, the morrowe after the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision

shee stayed there vntill that tyme, comforting the

affiaunce with her by spirituall giftes, as hee had
by carnall generation. And if wee should allowe

for during the time they were in the Desart, none
were circumcised, which no doubt was through

her, whom he tooke to be his murderer.</p>
            <p>But while hee was thus troubled in chusing by
which torture he could best like to end his life, and
in a manner resolued to dismisse her, crying out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
heauen &amp; earth, the one because he thought
it had wrought him this wrong, the other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
it, his eyes grew as heauie as his heart, and by
a mourneful fall bereaued him of all his sences. And
being now at some little rest, not because he had no
griefe, but because he felt it not, hee thought hee
saw a man whose attire, comelinesse, and maiestie,
bewraied him to be no lesse then a prince, although
some kinde of his behauiour shewed him to bee no
more then a messenger, as bold to speake, as he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
able to perswade him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he thought he heard vse
these words vnto him. <hi>Ioseph</hi> sonne of <hi>Dauid</hi> feare
not to take <hi>Marie</hi> thy wife, for that which is bred
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19856:39"/>
in her is of the holy ghost, she shalbe deliuered of a
son whom thou shalt call Iesus, for he shall saue his
people from their sins. Which message being done,
he departed. Ioyfull tydinges to poore <hi>Ioseph,</hi> but
straight he feared that they wer too good to be true.
He knew her vertue was such as she might very wel
be thought the least vnfit to mother such a child, but
againe he thought himselfe not worthy to husband
such a wife: with which conceit being somewhat
troubled, he awaked, and calling to mind the vision
which he had seene sleeping, hee remembred also
what he had often heard waking, that a serpent was
threatned by a diuine oracle, &amp; a perpetuall enmity
pronounced betwixt him on the one part, &amp; a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and her seed on the other part, which he heard
expounded of a maiden, who should bring forth a
son without the company of man, expressed suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
in that it was called her seed, and confirmed at
another time by the same oracle to <hi>Achas</hi> K. of the
Iewes, when it was told him that a virgin shold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
in her womb, &amp; bring forth a son: &amp; afterward
an other answer was giuen, that a sprig shold spring
from the root of <hi>Iesse</hi> (who was K. <hi>Dauids</hi> father) &amp; a
flower from thence shold bud, to shew that as a flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
grew only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> one, so likewise shold he of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
was so great expectation. And what strange or new
thing this should be which the oracle did insinuate
God wold make that a virgin shold conceiue a man,
he could not imagin vnles it shold be vnderstood to
be done without the company of a man, &amp; that the
infant shold haue what perfection could be in man,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19856:39"/>
which agreed very wel with his visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. These &amp; such
like as he recounted in his mind, he recanted that
which before he ment, &amp; now hauing as great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to beare the ioyes he felt, as he had before to
brooke the fault which he found, he held it, &amp; not
without cause the gretest happines he could haue in
this worlde to enioy the loue of her, whose vertue
surmounted all who were vertuous, &amp; were not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
it selfe. She was a yong maiden, but of graue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor,
able to haue prouoked the best mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to loue, but she reproued euen in her face all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of lust, for whom her modestie drew to admire
her, her maiestie draue from thought of sinning by
her: &amp; although her pouertie sought to conceale it,
her properties shewed her princely desent. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he thanked the heauens for his good hap, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to thinke how he should make her amends, of
whom he had conceiued so hardly.</p>
            <p>But when he came againe vnto her, he stood stone
still, as though either his soule had forsaken him, or
his sences forgotten her: if only sorrow for his suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
past, &amp; ioy of his present resolution had fought
the combat, the quarrell might haue beene quickly
ended, &amp; poore <hi>Ioseph</hi> wold with teares either haue
confessed vnto her his fault, or haue congratulated
his owne good fortune, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t a reuerence entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the lists, preuailed against both, which made him
as backward in his paces, as loue could make him
forwarde in his lookes, wherefore shee percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his eyes fixed so vpon her, as if he meant they
shoulde not straye, and his heeles so fastened to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19856:40"/>
the ground, as if he had beene minded they should
neuer stirre, she beganne to be abashed at this so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
an alteration, and blushed to thinke whether
she had giuen him any iust cause of so strange a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation:
but her conscience assuring her, that shee
had beene alwaies as forwarde in shewing him all
manner of curtesie, as she was free from suffering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
maner of corruption, she encountred him with
such sweet piercing lookes, as she encouraged him
to prosecute his former professed loues, but in such
sort, as ioy, griefe, and reuerence were moderators
in his wordes, countenance, and behauiour. He
confessed his iealousie, and suspition he had of her,
&amp; humblie craued pardon therefore, vowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
for his pennance, vntill his dying day in sight
of the world, a true and faithfull spouse, and in all
his actions a most diligent and obedient seruant, he
vttered his intention to dismisse her: and being so
fully satisfied in the misterie wrought in her, he was
now become a suter vnto her, that she wold vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to accept of him.</p>
            <p>And she perceiuing that this worke could not
possiblie proceed without his knowledge, recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto him what had chanced vnto her, but with
such humilitie &amp; lowlines of mind, as was sufficient
to haue perswaded a truth, &amp; disswaded him from
his determined purpose, if he had before discouered
his iealousie vnto her. Wherfore after humble thanks
to her Lord, who in such sort had supplied her bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
backwardnes she embraced her spouse, who
trembled for reuerence to touch her, and she did not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19856:40"/>
onely pardon his offence past, but dispensed also
with that pennance which hee had enioyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
so farre foorth as it concerned her owne
person, but craued most careful attendance on him,
whome shee had conceiued. Many wordes passed
not betwixt them at this meeting, because they
both were willing that this his fault, as it was qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
forgiuen, so it should also be quickly forgotten,
but they could not parte without many ioyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they both had their wish, that this sacred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
as it cleared her from all suspected faultes,
so it should clense him from all superfluons fancies,
and they liued euer after with such contentment &amp;
happinesse, that they neither enuied at the statelie
port of earthly princes, nor desired the highest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of the heauenly spirites, yet coulde they not
but wish euery day her time were expired, that not
onely they, but the whole world also might enioye
whome they expected, for although a speciall

of the Citie was an hollow place in a rocke, either
by nature, or art, made fit for the receite of cattell<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
wherein was a maunger, where stoode an Oxe,

couple in the coldest time of Winter, where they
neither had other companie, nor comfort, then is

as they knew not where to make any little fire, they
resolued themselues that patience and contentment
must be their best fare: with which after they had
spent halfe the night, and the virgin perceiued her
houre was come to be deliuered, she applied her self
vnto her wonted deuotions, &amp; <hi>Ioseph</hi> being warned
thereof, hastened to make ready such cloutes as he

betwixt the Oxe &amp; the Asse, who with their breath
qualified the coldnesse of the aire round about him,
her selfe also being readie to comfort him, what she

            <p>Wonder (O ye heauens) be astonished, O earth,
he who was prince both of heauen and earth, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

Was it euer heard since the beginning of the world,
that one of such a nature, as neither any sense could
discerne any portraiture, nor any science discouer
his least perfection, should not only become an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

vnto a narrow, homely, and base place, where he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For the virgins labour was not such as other

kinde of paine beeing the rewarde onelie of sinne,
of which hee acquitte her, and corruption of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
not without concupiscence, which neuer was
acquainted with her: so that in all poynts shee was
as pure and perfect a virgin after this natiuitie, as
shee was the firste day after her owne. Such
a mother onelie became Gods sonne to haue,
and such a sonne was none, but a uirgin worthie
to conceiue.</p>
            <p>So was the Oracle fulfilled, which spake of a gate
in the East, which should euer bee shut, through
which no man shoulde passe, because the Lorde
God of Israel had entered by it, and it shoulde

flaming with fire, and not consuming, foreshewed,
a virgin should conceiue a childe in her wombe
without any corruption.</p>
            <p>So was the expectation both of heauen and
earth in part satisfied, because he now beganne to

            <p>O <hi>Ioseph</hi> thrise happie, because it was thy happe

Now doest thou see the Saint whome thou hast

seest lie crying in the manger, thou knewest hee
was thy Lord and maker, and no lesse admirable in

neither needest to rise by night, nor yet to range by
day, to seeke whom thy soule doeth loue, nor to

for they which came through the citie vnto thee at

            <p>Pouertie much hated by others, ought to bee

thy cottage must bee his court, thy company his

Loue thought the time too long, which was

whom he loued, would not let him stay to take an
answere.</p>
            <p>But assoone as he had passed from the watch, hee
found whom he loued: for a little inferiour to the
angels had he created mankind, which through her
owne fault was lost, and therefore rightly he is saide
to find her: for vnto Gods Image and likenesse was
man made, and placed in earth for a time in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
he was plentifullie enriched with all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
giftes, and created a Prince ouer all earthlie

a cowardly wylinesse, and therefore God made in
the likenesse of man will restore him againe by a
wotthie victorie.</p>
            <p>And now that thou hast found her whom thou
louedst, thou hast taken such sure holde of her, as she
cannot goe but wither thou guidest her, she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rest, but where thou remaynest, thou hast
not onelie brought her into thy mothers house,
(for father and mother was all one with thee in

and loue which thy father had ouer thee, thou ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest

where thou wert begotten, keeping nothing secret
from her, which thou mayst shew, &amp; she conceiue,
and adiuring all the daughters of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> by the
goates and harts of the field, that they doe not rayse
thy loue, or cause her to awake before her selfe
will. A strong loue, a strange care, doth the disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of thy loue deserue so sharpe a punishment, as
he who doth it shuld be accounted either as a goat,
whose filthinesse signifieth all wante of grace, or
as a hart, whose fearefulnesse supposeth him voyde
of charitie, for grace will not dwell with filth, and
charitie doth expell all feare, but what? dost thou
thinke that euer shee will haue that will to arise, or
to awake out of thine embracings, being, so fast ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to thee in matrimonie, that although yee bee
God and man, yet ye are not two, but one Christ.
Great dishonour would it be vnto thee, that after so
much seeking after her, thou shouldest euer suffer
her to be diuorced from thee, for al which know of
how great power thou art, will imagine a want of
loue in thee, to let her goe from thee. True it is, that
by thy proclamation, thy warrant of peace in earth
auayleth onely such as are of good will, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>How narrowly didst thou search, who wouldest

howe feruently didst thou loue, who to

foundest her, to whom thy soule was so surely ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
thy tears do witnesse it, with the which thou
doest bewaile her more then thy selfe, and bewray

But still thy weeping, vntill thou art past thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

her with a cheerefull countenance, whom thou
hast chosen to giue thee this charitable attendance.
Apply thy selfe to a virgins teate, whose breastes

Runne out thine entended race, prouoke al aduerse

was to haue an infinite punishment, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the offender could not in any limited time

which should endure without limit, and
because God his owne nature was so superexcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
that it was capable of nothing but happinesse,
hee was to take such a nature, as wherein he might

man knewe of himselfe howe to sinne, hee
thought it best in the same nature, to teach him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

from whence proceeded his mightines, both
in word and worke, to the redeeming of mankind,
ransacking of hell, and in the end the ouerthrowing

that which the whole Trinitie had before created,
and thereby creating a new by grace, what was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
sinne come to nought. He was also a Prince

that not without cause hee was proclaimed by that

            <p>The games of <hi>Olympus</hi> were moste famous in
Greece, so called because they were at the foot of
the mountain <hi>Olympus,</hi> which was so hie that it gaue
name vnto the heauens: for it reached so far aboue
the middle region of the aire, that neuer came any
winde or raine at the toppe thereof, as appeared by
that certaine Philosophers left there some caracters
in dust, which they found in the same maner after a
yeare, but neither could any bird mount vp vnto
the toppe thereof, because the aire was too pure for
any inferiour creature: for which cause the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
which went vp, caryed with them spunges

            <p>The Romanes also, beside running with horses,
and with chariots, and fighting naked with swords,
to this end, that being in warres it should bee no
wonder vnto them to see woundes, had other
games, as their Saturnall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> in honour of <hi>Saturne,</hi>
which they kept fiue daies in December in feasting,
sporting, and mutuall presenting with gifts, and in
remembrance of the golden world, when <hi>Saturne</hi>
was king, they reckoned all things so in common
for those fiue dayes, as there was neither owner
of any substance, nor maister of any seruant. These
were first deuised by <hi>Ianus</hi> a king of <hi>Italy,</hi> and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
yeerely vnto <hi>Saturne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They had other games, which they called
<hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>percals,</hi> in which the young nobilitie ranne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vp and downe with such beasts skinnes, as were
then sacrificed, striking euerie one whom they met,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19856:61"/>
and women offered themselues in their way, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
by their strokes to haue the easier trauaile, if
they were with childe, or to waxe bigge, if they
were before barren. These were vsed in the honour
of <hi>Pan,</hi> and were named <hi>Lupercalles,</hi> either because
they offered sacrifice to <hi>Pan,</hi> for the preseruing of
their flocks from the wolfe, or because they sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
dogges to gratifie the wolfe, which nursed
<hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Rhemus,</hi> or thirdly, because the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was offered at the foote of mounte <hi>Palatine</hi>
in <hi>Rome,</hi> where there was a caue consecrated to <hi>Pan,</hi>
which in remembrance that <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Rhemus</hi>
were there nursed by a wolfe, was named <hi>Luper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi>
Some say these games were so called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the sacrifices then offered, were to purge
the hellish spirits with the bloud of goates, and that
for this cause the moneth was called Februarie, in
which these games were vsed. Others say they
had their name of a mountain in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> called <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi>
where they were first inuented, and were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
brought into <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Euander</hi> the Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
king, at what time hee was banished out of his
owne countrey, and hereupon they say the games
were performed by naked men, because they were
deuised in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> when the people were both
bare of cloathing, and of barbarous condition, and
so continued also afterward, when they were of a
more ciuill conuersation.</p>
            <p>Others say, that <hi>Pan</hi> mistaking <hi>Hercules</hi> for <hi>Iole,</hi>
(who vpon some occasion at that time, slept in he
Lions skinne) was once so discouered, before hee
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19856:61"/>
got his wished pray, that he departed with nought
but shame of his wanton purpose, and could neuer
after that his conceited euil sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed, abide any aparrel
in his sports.</p>
            <p>Other some say, this naked running vp and down
was in remembrance of a worthie victorie, which
<hi>Romulus</hi> had ouer certaine theeues, who, (while the
people were busie in these sports) draue away a
great companie of their cattell, and <hi>Romulus</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
thereof (naked as he was vpon some other
occasion, pursued them, and brought back the stoln
pray, for which cause those which ran thus naked,
had their faces stayned with bloud, and other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
after with wooll dipped in milke to wash
them, but whatsoeuer was the cause of their sports,
thus was the course of their life spent.</p>
            <p>After these were other deuised in honour of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
who was sometime a king of <hi>Italy,</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> they
built a famous temple, and set therein his picture,
which they made with two faces, to signifie the
concord which was made betwixt <hi>Romulus</hi> king of
the Romanes, and <hi>Titus Tatius,</hi> king of the Sabins, at
what time a bloudy warre being begun to one or
others ouerthrow, the maidens which were stolne
by the Romanes, and for reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ge of which rape, the
Sabians vowed the vtter ruine of the Romanes,
came into the fielde, and offered themselues to
death, rather then they would liue to see for
theyr cause, either their parents slaine on the
one side, or theyr husbandes whome they now
fancyed on the other side. This Temple
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19856:62"/>
of <hi>Ianus</hi> the Romanes did leaue open so long, as
they had any warres abroade with forraine nations,
either because that going foorth to warre, they
should also haue a care of their countrey they left
behind them, as the Idoll looked both forward
and backward, or else in hope of some extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
helpe, by <hi>Ianus</hi> his protection, when they
should bee driuen to any extremitie, because that

Temple for his best defence, were forced to retyre
by a whole water, which sprunge in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
from before the Temple against them.
Many other things are recorded of <hi>Ianus,</hi> which
many thinke are to bee applyed to diuers of the
same name, but hee in whose honour the first of
the two moneths which <hi>Numa Pompilius, (Romulus</hi>
his successor) added vnto <hi>Romulus</hi> his yeere, was
<hi>Ianus</hi> king of <hi>Italie,</hi> who built a Citie not far from
the place where afterward <hi>Rome</hi> was built, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it <hi>Ianiculum,</hi> and him they thought they did so
gretly honor, when they were either ouer lauish in
expences, or too lasciuious in their sports, that
when his calends came, that is the first day of that
month, hee seemed the deuoutest in this rite, who
shewed by his ryot, that hee neither deemed it a
shame at any time afterward to bee in want, nor a
sinne to be at all times wanton.</p>
            <p>These as the first in the yeere, and other abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as they fell, came the Prince this day to abolish,
as hee shewed both by the shedding of his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bloud, and the sound of his princely name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:19856:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Yet notwithstanding that he was a prince, and
therefore freeborne, and a priest, and therefore to
be forborne, so soone as his name was giuen him,
he was sessed by the officers, and paid a tribute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his owne subiect (for as yet the infants of <hi>Palesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
were not exempted from this taxe) and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was the more willing to conceale her sonnes
deitie, because she thought it would nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
from his dignitie, being at that time taken
for a priuate person, not for a prince.</p>
            <p>But not long after it was blowne abroad, that
such a prince was borne, and princes hastened to
do their homage.</p>
            <p>An old prophesie was in <hi>Arabia,</hi> that a starre
should rise in <hi>Iacob,</hi> and a rod spring in <hi>Israel,</hi> which
should both strike the princes of <hi>Moab,</hi> and destroy
the sonnes of <hi>Seth,</hi> with many other so great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues,
that the prophet sighed to thinke hee
should not liue to see it, and the king of <hi>Moab</hi> was
frighted, fearing that hee had liued to feele it: for
the Israelites comming out of the desart of <hi>Pharan</hi>

that <hi>Balaac</hi> the king of <hi>Moab</hi> had better cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to fight against them with shrewde wordes,
then with sharpe weapons, and therefore vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> was one who did so

sent speedily vnto him to come and curse the

not suffering any of them to haue part with
<hi>Isaac</hi> in the lande promised vnto him: yet did he
not send them away emptie handed, but bestowed
vpon them great riches, apparell, and iewels, which
he had taken from the foure kings, whom hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
in the rescue of his nephew <hi>Lot:</hi> among
which giftes some write that <hi>Abraham</hi> gaue vnto

East parts at this time vnto <hi>Bethleem</hi> of <hi>Iuda,</hi> which
iourney they did the more willingly take, because
probablie their ancestors were also Iewes: for the
Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> among other great fauours which
she receiued of king <hi>Salomon,</hi> was accepted for his
wife, and returned into her countrey with childe,
and carried with her twelue thousand Iewes, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie

that after a while the chiefest in the countrey vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that their fathers were Iewes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he sonne
which she had by <hi>Salomon</hi> she crowned king, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering
all her dominions vnto him: and of that
stocke vnto this day (as some say) remayneth the
great monarch of those coastes, commonly called
<hi>Priest Iohn.</hi> But the principall motiue of these three
kinges their voyage was the sight of a starre, which
did penetrate so farre into their vnderstanding,
that by that extraordinarie light, and what they
had by the prophesie, they resolued that the prince
was now at the last borne, of which had beene
so great expectation, for although they were men
of great learning, yet could not their skill attaine
to the perfect meaning of the star, which appeared
vnto them, without farther helpe then they could
haue by Astronomie<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> wonder they might to see so
neere vnto them so bright a shining starre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was much lower then where exhalations
fiered doe appeare blasing like starres, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
with the Sunne for brightnesse, as it
receyued no light from the Sunne, as other starres
doe<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> so neyther did the brightnesse of the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19856:64"/>
sunne drowne the clearnesse thereof, as it doeth
of other starres, where it selfe doth shine, and the
greater might their wonder bee, because that all
such tokens as were commonly in all other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
starres, or commets to signifie eyther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
or death were so farre from this starre, that
it betokened nothing but health and life: and that
the authour of life had taken vpon him a new kind
of life, although perchance in some secondarie
sort it might also pretend the death of the prince,
whose life it shewed, as may appeare by some of the
presentes which the kinges brought, who were
both warned by this starre to seeke him, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
to finde him out: yet was it no Angell, as
many haue thought, but a starre, as much superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
to other starres in brightnesse, as inferior in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
made of some former matter, or created of
nothing by him to whome all thinges are possible,
and afterward eyther resolued into that of which
it was made, or if created for this purpose, the
cause thereof ceasing, the effect came againe to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but it kept such a course, as the kinges fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
it were no more subiect to bee deceiued of
their purpose, then were the Israelites when tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling
from <hi>Egipt</hi> vnto the lande of promisse, they
were guided by a cloude, which alway went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them in the daye time, and a fierie pillar in
the night: for the starre neuer ceased to shine, but
to their greater light, nor to conduct them but to
their greater comfort: wherefore not without the
prouidence of the stars guide, they entred <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:19856:64"/>
where they were both confirmed in the truth of
their former prophesie, and comforted with the
shortnes of their following iorney: but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the amasing both of <hi>Herod</hi> and all the cittie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the last thing which the Iewes had done, was
an oath sworne to accept <hi>Herod</hi> for their king, which
althougb hee had laboured both with curtesie and
with crueltie for the space of thirty years little more
or lesse, hee neuer obtained it of the whole countrie
vntill this time.</p>
            <p>The three princes as soon as they came into the
cittie, demaunded boldely what they doubted not
euery man knew, (a kinges seate fitting best a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
birth, and such a birth being commonly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
with a publike triumph) they demaunded for
him by his title, not knowing as yet his name, where
is hee who is borne king of the Iewes? wee see his
starre in the East, and are come with presentes to
adore him, was it then any wonder that <hi>Herod</hi> was
troubled, who wrongfully entered into the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie,
and the Iewes touched deepelie, who had
rashly sworne themselues his subiectes, the one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
iust cause to feare that he should be put down
as a tyrant, and the others no hope but to bee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
as traytors? and although <hi>Herod</hi> coulde haue
beene very well contented neuer to haue heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing more concerning this matter, yet feare in
the ende first encreased a desire to know the rest, &amp;
then to deuise some mischiefe fot a remedie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
calling the chiefe of the Priestes &amp; the Scribes
of the people, he asked them where Christ shoulde
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19856:65"/>
be borne (for so was the prince called, to shew that
hee was annointed). In <hi>Bethleem</hi> they answered of
<hi>Iuda,)</hi> for in <hi>Galilie</hi> was an other cittie called <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leem,</hi>
and was in the tribe of <hi>Zabulon)</hi> according
vnto the prophesie: And thon <hi>Bethleem</hi> of <hi>Iuda</hi>
art not the least among the chiefest (cities) of <hi>Iuda,</hi>
because out of thee shall come a gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>de, who shall
gouerne my people Israell. <hi>Herod</hi> being thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by the priestes of the prince, he beganne
to deuise the prince his destruction, and hauing
resolued how hee would preuent his misconstered
fall, he ranne into a greater follie: he called the
three kinges secretlie vnto him, and learned of
them what he could aswell concerning the starre, as
also their prophesies, and whatsoeuer they coulde
enforme him eyther by their owne skill, or the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of their countrie, which they coulde not
want, but rather haue in greate plentie, where so
many Iewes had liued, and left a posterity, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
sent them to enquire diligently where the
prince was, and requested them to bring him
worde thereof, that hee might also goe to adore
him.</p>
            <p>The princes set forward to finish a long iorneye,
for <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was at the least 1200. miles from <hi>Saba,</hi>
which was the seat of <hi>Iasper,</hi> one of these three kings
and no doubt <hi>Melchior</hi> and <hi>Balthasar</hi> (for so were
the other two named) had their seates not far from
thence, for in those times within the compas of 20.
miles dwelled commonly three or foure kings, as in
<hi>Palestina</hi> which for length or bredth seemed to little
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19856:65"/>
for one, were 37. kinges, so that they might without
any great busines beginne this iorney together, or
without any great difficultie meet by chance in the
way, none knowing before of others intention, and
perchance this might bee the cause, that all three
brought of the same kind of presents, which might
haue been thought superfluous if they had in one
companie begunne their iorney, and the starre kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his course toward the west might bee a guide
vnto them all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ming from places in the east, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were not much distant one from the other, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
that part of <hi>Arabia</hi> (as some say) which was called
<hi>Magodia,</hi> whereupon these kinges were called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi,</hi>
that is to say, men of that country, yet many think
they were called <hi>Magi</hi> because they studied art Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke,
and say that by their skill in this art they had
vnderstanding of this prince his birth, and who he
was, but it is not likelie that the prince of that arte
had himselfe any such knowledge, for there was as
great reason to conceale the mysterie of this prince
his birth, as the mysterie of his conception, others
were also called <hi>Magi,</hi> who liued in great abstinence
and spent their liues in honest studies, and of this
sort perchance were these three kinges, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no naturall cause of the appearing of this starre,
remembred that extraordinarily a starre should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to shew the birth of a mighty prince in <hi>Iuda,</hi>
and when this starre appeared in so strange a sorte,
they perswaded themselues this was it, which was
foretold by <hi>Balaam</hi> in their countrie, &amp; mounting
vpon <hi>Dromedaries</hi> (which are incomparaby swif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

iorney guided by the same starre, which now lastly
shewing it selfe again vnto their no little ioy, when
they passed out of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> toward <hi>Bethleem,</hi> it we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
before them vntill it came to the place where the
prince was, and his mother, and there it staide so
low in the aire, that the kinges neuer asked for the
house in which they were, and hauing ended his
course which was no longer then the kinges ioruey,
(for it went not round aboute the worlde as other
starres, planets, or cometes vse to doe, but kept his
course in such order, as when the kinges remoued
the starre did also remoue, and when they rested,
the starre did not stirre any further) it was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

            <p>When these three kings entered into the caue
they founde the childe and <hi>Mary</hi> his mother, and

perchance of the custome among the Iewes, that

but the same presents, golde, mirrhe and franken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
acknowledging thereby that hee was a prince,
a mortall man, &amp; yet a God, or as some will a priest,
whose office it was to offer frankensence vnto God,
but being both God and man, &amp; not onely a prince
by defcent, but also a Priest, the frankensence could
not without greate mystery bee offered vnto him,
whether it was in the one respect or the other, yet it
is more probable that it sign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fied at that time that
hee was God, because his priesthood by which he

offered sacrifice was not according vnto the order
of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who among other sacrifices offered also
incense, but according to the order of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi>
and was a farre more spirituall kind of priesthoode.
Beside that these three kings brought it to offer it
themselues vnto him, not that hee should offer it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an other.</p>
            <p>That this infant was of the blood of the princes of
<hi>Iudah,</hi> is manifestly deducted by his pedegree from
<hi>Dauid</hi> by the kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> vnto <hi>Ioseph</hi> the virgins

and <hi>Ioachim</hi> the virgins father being knowne to bee
of such substance, as he liued onely vpon the thirde

leaue his daughter <hi>Marie</hi> at the least a coheire

had none) for <hi>Ioachim</hi> neuer had any male issue: it
is a good proofe according vnto the law mentioned
that if <hi>Maries</hi> husband were of the familie of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
she was also of the same family. Wherfore although

But an other hystorie seeming to fetch <hi>Ioseph</hi> his
petigree from king <hi>Dauid</hi> by other parents, woulde
make the former suspected, were it not a law among
the Iewes, that the widow of the one brother should
marry with the other, or the next of kin, if she had no
children by the first, and that the child of the second
husband should bee accounted by the law the first
husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds child, although in nature it is the seconds:
for by this meanes a man might be said to be the son
of two men, of one by nature, and of another by the
law. Hereof <hi>Ioseph</hi> is said in one petigree to bee the
son of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and in another petigree the son of <hi>Hely,</hi>
as being the naturall son of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and called the son
of <hi>Hely,</hi> because <hi>Iacob</hi> had h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But although it be most true that the yong prince
did descend of the princes of the Iewes, and that he
was of the familie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> yet these petigrees of
<hi>Ioseph</hi> proue nothing, but that the prince his mother
was of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> because <hi>Ioseph</hi> who in these
petigrees is proued to be of that name, did espouse
her (it being a thing vnlawful among the Iewes, that
any shuld match but in their own tribe) but neither
doth this proue that this prince was of the tribe of
<hi>Iuda,</hi> because notwithstanding diuerse tribes should
not ioyne togither in mariage, the tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi> and
<hi>Leui</hi> might, and therefore the the proofe that <hi>Ioseph</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:19856:67"/>

            <p>For this cause many take the seconde petigree

although by this account the Prince should haue
but one King among his auncesters, yet hee had
manie absolute Princes, and gouernours of the
people descending from <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> vnto <hi>Iamnes,</hi>
(otherwise called <hi>Ioannes Hircanus)</hi> who not
brooking the miserie in which hee and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

            <p>But in these petigrees appeareth a verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
difficultie. For if <hi>Salathiell,</hi> and <hi>Zorobabel,</hi>
mencioned in the seconde petigree, are the same
which are mencioned in the first, why doth not the
seconde petigree name the princes auncestours
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19856:68"/>
from king <hi>Dauid</hi> by king <hi>Salomon,</hi> as the first doth,
but by <hi>Nathan,</hi> an other of <hi>Dauids</hi> sonnes, by <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabe</hi>
king <hi>Salomon</hi> his mother. Againe, if <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiel,</hi>
and <hi>Zorobabel</hi> mentioned in the second peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
are not the same which are mencioned in the
first petigree, how came they which are reckoned in
the second petigree to be princes of the people, and
their posterity, vntill <hi>Iamnes</hi> slue himselfe. A sacred
history affirmeth, that <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> who is saide to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
from <hi>Iechonias</hi> (the last king of the Iewes) by
<hi>Salathiel,</hi> did carrie the people home out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
where they had beene captiues. And other hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
of authoritie continue this gouernment by
<hi>Mosullam,</hi> or <hi>Misciola Zorobabels</hi> sonne, and such as
are reckoned in the seconde petigree, to bee the
prince his ancesters.</p>
            <p>The difficultie will bee easilie solued, if we may
say that <hi>Salathiel</hi> and <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> mencioned in the
one petigree were the same, which are mentioned
in the other, and that <hi>Salathiel</hi> was not sonne vnto
<hi>Iechonias,</hi> but vnto <hi>Neri.</hi> And this is agreeable vnto
the Oracle which said, that <hi>Iechonias</hi> should be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
and one, who should neither prosper, nor haue
anie ofspring, which shoulde sit in the throne of
<hi>Dauid,</hi> or haue any authoritie euer after in <hi>Iudah,</hi>
Which shoulde not haue beene true, if hee shoulde
haue children to succede him, and to say that a
man is barren, or that the sonne dooth not succeed
his father, when the sonne hath not that pompe, and
maiestie, which his father had, is to say that most
men are barren, and few sons succeed their fathers,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19856:68"/>
so we may say that neither <hi>Salomons</hi> sonne did suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

him, was taken and slaine, and throwne out of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
and lay vnburied according to the Oracle,
which sayd that hee should haue no other then the
buriall of an Asse. Nor his sonne <hi>Iechonias,</hi> who was
within three moneths after caried prisoner into
<hi>Chaldea,</hi> least perchance he should by some meanes
haue reuenged his fathers death: yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is this <hi>Iechonias</hi> sayde to haue sitten in the
throne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> and his children,
hauing authoritie in <hi>Iudah</hi> as Kinges, although
for some cause they woulde not bee called Kings,
it is euident (the Oracle being of infallible truth)
that <hi>Salathiel</hi> father to <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> was not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sonne to <hi>Ieconias,</hi> but to <hi>Neri,</hi> and accounted
the sonne of <hi>Ieconias,</hi> as descending of <hi>Ieconias</hi>
his wife, who was left to <hi>Neri,</hi> the next of kinne
to <hi>Ieconias,</hi> and to raise seed to <hi>Ieconias,</hi> who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Oracle was barren.</p>
            <p>Some woulde seeme to solue this difficultie
by saying that <hi>Salathiel</hi> was the naturall sonne
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19856:69"/>
of <hi>Ieconias,</hi> and adopted by <hi>Neri</hi> after <hi>Ieconias</hi> his

reckoned from King <hi>Dauid</hi> by <hi>Nathan,</hi> the
other beeing both a more true, and more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
petigree.</p>
            <p>By this pedigree also is shewed, how the prince
was high priest, for <hi>Onias</hi> the high priest hauing
one onely daughter, and one sonne, hee gaue
his daughter in marriage vnto <hi>Tobias,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
called <hi>Mathathias, Siloa,</hi> who was grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnto <hi>Iamnes</hi> the last prince which the Iewes
had immediately before the Machabees, and one
of the yong prince his anncestors, but his sonne
<hi>Onias</hi> (some call him <hi>Ananias,</hi> and say that hee was
not his sonne, but his brother) fledde from
<hi>Hierusalem</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where by <hi>Philomater</hi> the
King of <hi>Egypt</hi> his lycense, hee built in <hi>Hieropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
a Temple like vnto the temple in <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and there ended his life in scisme. <hi>Onias</hi>
the Father hadde also twoo brethren, who after
they hadde brought him out of the high-priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
were themselues as they bribed <hi>Antiochus
Epiphanes,</hi> (the King of <hi>Siria,)</hi> nowe one of them
high priest, nowe another, and in the ende both
shutte out, and slaine. Some doe say, that those
three brethren, were sonnes to <hi>Simon,</hi> who was
high Priest, and sonne vnto that <hi>Onias,</hi> which fled
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but whosoeuer they were, all perished,
and oue succeeded them in that dignitie, whose
name was <hi>Alcintus,</hi> but had no title or right vnto it,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19856:69"/>
and after him did <hi>Mathathias</hi> hold it, who was of
the familye of <hi>Ioiarib,</hi> to whom fell the first lot
to serue in the temple, according vnto that order
which King <hi>Dauid</hi> appoynted to bee kept among
the Priests, and therefore was but an ordynarie
Priest dwelling in the Cittie of <hi>Modin, (Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
being alwayes the seate of the high Priest) and
the Machabees, his Sonnes were extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accepted of by the people, in respect that no
man who was neerer, would challenge the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priesthood,
and they were admitted for cheefe
Princes, not because the right line of <hi>Dauid</hi> was
cleane extinguished, but because it was brought
to so lowe an estate, that it could not, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would right the peoples wronges, which no
doubt was Gods speciall prouidence, that for
some fiue or sixe descents, both the high priesthood
and the scepter should goe from the true heyre, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not from the right familie, that when this
yong Prince came, he might in the more secret ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
bring his purpose to good passe.</p>
            <p>That this infant was a naturall man, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any dignitie whatsoeuer was in him, it
was euident, for that alreadie thereof, had beene
sufficient proofe made by the griefe he felt, as well
in his circumcision, as in cold, &amp; whatsoeuer occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
else might chance to trie it. And although the
virgin very wel vnderstood no lesse before, yet this
offring of mirre (a thing which was vsed about the
body, in the last obsequie done vnto it after death)
did so refresh it in her minde, that in all this ioye

which was made for three Kinges presence, shee
coulde not choose but grieue, yet in the end vsing
some kinde of patience in a matter, shee coulde
not helpe, shee conformed her selfe into the
rest of the princely companie, who nothing aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
either at the childes present lowe estate, nor

was afterwarde to followe at the time appoynted,
performed that for which they came<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> with all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

            <p>Well woorthie were yee noble princes of the

               </gap>rely in her caue,
vntill her time came to go vnto the temple, when
both she was expected to be purified, and her yong
infant to bee presented: for the Iewes accounted
all women vncleane, which according to natures
course were deliuered of children, either male or
female, with this difference, that of a manchild she
remaine vncleane fortie dayes, and of a woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
double so much. And God challenged the
first begotten among the Iewes to bee his, whether
it were man or beast: which dutie vnto God in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
times was diuersly performed: for at the first
euerie manchild did offer sacrifice, as appeareth by
the historie of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abell.</hi> Afterward the first
begotten onely, as the chiefest, was priest, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the whole familie, but in the family of <hi>Iacob</hi>
(who by a supernaturall dispensation got the elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and the priesthood from his brother <hi>Esau)</hi>
the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> as the most faithfull to God (suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19856:73"/>
proued in reuenging the wrong done vnto
him by those, who adored the golden calfe in the
desert) being accepted and assumpted vnto this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
and to serue at the altar without any redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the rest of the people might according as they
were appointed by their law, after a presentation
made of their first begotten sonne, 10. dayes after his
birth, redeeme him of God for fiue sicles. The first
breed of beastes, such as were not admitted for the
sacrifice, were to be redeemed by being chaunged
for other beastes, which were lawfully sacrificed as
the first breed of an Asse was redeemed for a sheep,
and other beastes for a sicle and a halfe, and if they
were not redeemed, they were to bee killed, which
was freely granted by the consent of all the Iewes
in remembrance that God slew the first begotten
of the Egiptians, both man &amp; beast, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> after many
other plagues, they wold not suffer the Iewes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
According vnto this law, as also to fulfill the
law of purifying women after their deliuerie, the
maiden mother, although she knew both her selfe to
be a virgin, &amp; therfore without need of any such ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
&amp; her son to be the son of God, &amp; therfore
in that respect, aswell as for that he opened not his
mothers womb, not to be subiect vnto that law, yet
she thought it most fit to present her selfe and her
sonne at the temple, carrying with her 5. sicles to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
her son, &amp; a paire of yong pigeons or turtles
for her own offering, for such was the law, that who
were able should offer a lambe and a turtle, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pigeon, and who were not able to buy a lambe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19856:74"/>
should bring a paire of turtles or yong pigeons for
old pigeons would not be accepted of, nor young
turtles, because they are not so good as the other,
and the best were thought bad enough to offer vnto
God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And in this sort was this offering made: The
whole lambe (if a lambe were offered) or one of the
turtles or doues (if the partie were not able to buy
a lambe) was consumed with fire in the sacrifice, &amp;
a turtle doue was offered as a sacrifice for sinne: for
the Iewes had diuers kind of sacrifices, one which
was offered vnto God for the speciall reuerence and
loue which men did beare vnto him, and this sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was all consumed vppon the altar. An other
kind of sacrifice was called a sacrifice for sinne, and
the one part of the oblation was consumed on the
altar, and the other was to the priestes vse, and to be
eaten presently by them in the same place, vnlesse
the offering were made for the sinne of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or for the high priest, for then it was all consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with fire, &amp; no foule were offered in this kind
of sacrifice; because they could not be deuided, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
at the purification of women, for then was a
doue alwaies offered for sinne, whatsoeuer was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>o offered to be wholly burnt, but the doue offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at that time (after it was killed according to
the law) was wholly vnto the priestes vse. A third
sacrifice was offered vp either in thanksgiuing vnto
God, for such his benefites as alreadie they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
or to obtaine at Gods hand something
which they wanted, and this host was diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
three parts, whereof one was consumed with fire
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19856:74"/>
vpon the altar, another was to the priests vse, and
all their family, and the third part was to theyr
vse, whose offering it was, and none of all these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
might be offered without salt.</p>
            <p>The beasts which were offered in these sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
were such as might easily be had in <hi>Palestina,</hi>
and such as might bee driuen without any great
difficultie, as sheepe, oxen, goates, and of theyr
kind: the foule were such as were in great plentie,
as turtles, and other common doues, fishes were
altogether excluded from their offerings, both in
respect they could not be had at all times, when
men would, nor conueniently be brought aliue
vnto the Temple, and it was not lawfull to offer
any dead thing vnto God, but neither any quicke
thing which had any defect, for to this end were
the Priests exceeding cunning to feele euery ioynt,
from the head vnto the feete, and to iudge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any thing were otherwise then well in the
beast or foule which was offered, and thereupon
to accept of it, or reiect it, after which ceremonie
the people washed their handes, and layd them v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the beastes head which was offered, and left
the rest vnto the priests, without medling any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the sacrifice, except that in the third kinde
of sacrifice, the priest deliuered all the suet, and
the breast of the beast vnto them whose offering it
was, who taking it of the Priest<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> lifted it vp before
God, and deliuering it backe againe vnto the
priest, the breast was to the Priests vse, and also the
right shoulder, all the rest was to them which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19856:75"/>
made the offeringe, but the suet was all consumed
with fire, for it was as vnlawfull for them to eate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
suet of their offerings, as of the bloud, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were as curious in offering all the suet, as
they were in shedding all the bloud, a ceremony v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
euen where they might not vse any ordinarie
instrument of death, for although it was not lawful
for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to vse any instrument made for the purpose
in killing their turtles or doues, yet might they not
kill them, but by shedding their bloud, wherefore
they wreathed the necke, &amp; bowed the head back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vnto the winges, and with the nayles of their
fingers cut the throate of the foule, letting it in
that sort bleede to death.</p>
            <p>But what mysteire so euer was in killing the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
doues or pigions in this or in any other sacrifice,
it cannot bee without some great mysterie, that
the mayden mother made so poore an offering, for
a payre of turtles or pigeons were not to be offered
in this ceremony, but by such as were not able to
prouide a Lambe for theyr sacrifice, and a turtle
beside, or a pigeon for theyr sinne, and how could
shee bee in such want, whose parents were of so
great wealth, that the third parte onely of that
which they had, was sufficient for them, and shee
was eyther her fathers sole heyre, or at the least
had a third part (if it bee true that shee hadde other
twoo sisters) but put the case that shee reaped as
yet no profite by her fathers substance, as who
might yet bee liuing (yet some say hee was dead)
or her mother, or that her father (if hee were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased)
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19856:75"/>
gaue by will twoo thirds of that hee had,
one to the poore, another to the Temple, as hee
did in his life time, and that the maiden mother
was then to haue the profits, but of the third
part of that other third, and that not as yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
her mother was liuing, yet howe can shee
be accounted as poore, who so lately receiued so
great presents: for who can imagine that three
Kings would come so farre, to present another king
with a trifle, whose byrth was talked of so magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently,
that no one was either before, or after
iudged peerelesse for might and wisedome, but
was thought among the Iewes and Gentiles to bee
this Prince, beside the president which the Queene
of <hi>Saba</hi> gaue vnto them, when shee came vnto
King <hi>Salomon,</hi> and presented him with exceeding
great gifts, meant vnto this Prince, and for this
Prince his sake giuen vnto <hi>Salomon,</hi> because shee

               </gap>ee had beene the Prince of whome
was the prophesie in her countrey: and although
these three princes their Kingdomes all put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
were not to bee accounted of in comparison
of the Queen of Saba her dominions, yet no doubt
they were verie rich, as absolute Lords may bee of
most fertile &amp; rich countries, &amp; all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> bringing
gold according to their calling, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> who knew by

whome theyr predecessor could not, no
doubt they brought it in great aboundance, which
neither the virgin could refuse beeing an offering
of Kings, nor spend within the space of a moneth
in so poore a cottage, but neither could she dispose
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19856:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of it to the poore without great speech of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and to haue sent it vnto the Temple, had beene
to certifie them that the three kings had not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beene with her (of which perchance they might
haue some knowledge otherwise) but also had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
her sonne to be the king of the Iews,
which, whatsoeuer else was to bee disclosed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, was as yet to bee kept most secret from
them, and perchance this was the cause why in
her offering shee pretended that pouertie, which
the better shee thought shee might doe, because
shee was not bound to offer any thing, but was
most pure before, and in place where shee did not
onely touch that which was holy (forbidden by
the lawe to women before they were purified) but
handled in most sweete manner that holy one, by
whome all are made holy. So that the question
might haue more difficultie why shee offered any
thing, then why shee did not offer almes, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that shee parted from the Temple, she vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
verie well, that shee had offered almes, at
whose death a sword of griefe should pierce her
owne soule.</p>
            <p>For among others which expected the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of Israel, one whose name was <hi>Simeon</hi> dwelling
in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> father vnto <hi>Gamaliel</hi> as some write,
and sonne vnto <hi>Hillel,</hi> who was one of the twoo
chiefe maisters of the Scribes and Pharyses, men of
great learning, and right vnderstanding, vntill op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
themselues against the Sadduces, who were
accounted heretickes among the Iewes, they fell
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19856:76"/>
by two much precisenesse, into most absurd super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions.
This <hi>Hillel</hi> liued 120. yeeres, and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
not long after the Machabees, he was of the
tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and no doubt instructed his sonne
<hi>Simeon</hi> how neere hee was, who was to come to
redeeme Israel: for which cause <hi>Simeon</hi> made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
his prayer vnto God, that hee might see his
Sauiour before hee dyed, which was promised vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and this day of the virgins purification per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
for comming according vnto his custome
into the Temple, and seeing the mayden mother
and her sonne, hee tooke the childe with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great ioy in his armes, and as one, who after
a long time had obtained his hearts desire, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
with a voyce, which was no lesse then an 100

            <p>Had this beene else where, the mayden mother
vsed vnto such matters, would either haue beene
very little or nothing mooued, but her sonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at that time, and in that place descryed, it made
her greatly amazed, much more did it astonish o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who could not but knowe that the three
Kings came to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to seeke such a childe,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19856:77"/>
and poore <hi>Ioseph</hi> among the rest maruailed not a
little, who was accounted by the people father of
the childe, and for that cause is so called in the same
sacred hystorie, which before had shewed how that
the Maiden mother conceyued this childe by the
holie Ghost without the companie of man. But old
<hi>Simeon</hi> draue her out of that maze, by drawing her
into a farre deeper muse, for afterwarde taking
aduauntage of his owne gray haires, and her greene
yeeres, hee blessed her, and gaue her as much
cause of griefe in prose, as hee had giuen of ioy
before in verse, and tolde her that her sonne should
bee the ruine (although also the raysing) of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
in Israel, and that he shoulde be a signe, which
shoulde bee contradicted, alluding perchaunce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that which the Oracle sayde vnto <hi>Achas</hi> king
of <hi>Iudah,</hi> The Lorde shall giue you a signe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a virgin shall conceiue and bring forth a sonne.
But in that <hi>Simeon</hi> sayde, that this signe shoulde
bee contradicted, hee woulde insinuate eyther a
troublesome life, or else a scandalous death, as
that eyther his doctrine woulde bee little estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of, where hee preached, or that his manner
of death shoulde bee such, as beeing suffered by
him, shoulde in malicious mynded men, dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
from the worthinesse, which others attribute
vnto him. For aptlie dooth the conclusion of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meons</hi>
speech vnto the virgin fol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ow. And a sworde
of griefe shall pierce thy soule, and manie secrete
thoughts be reuealed.</p>
            <p>And no sooner had <hi>Simeon</hi> done his deuotion, but
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19856:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a religious widow of 84. yeares, and aboue a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres old, daughter vnto <hi>Phanuel,</hi> of the tribe
of <hi>Aser,</hi> came, not vnto the Temple, for she was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
from thence, spending there all her life in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
and prayer, but vnto the maiden mother, and
hauing done her dutie vnto the yong prince, shee
spake of him (for she had before the spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie)
vnto all such as looked for the redemption
of Israel. And after these things were finished, they
returned into <hi>Galile,</hi> vnto their citie <hi>Nazareth,</hi> from
whence they parted, when they came to <hi>Bethleem.</hi>
These ceremonys being finished, which satisfied the
Iewes law, a new solemnitie was also begun, which
should abolish the Gentiles loosenesse, for as by the
princes his birth, the sports made in December in
honour of <hi>Saturne,</hi> were afterwarde turned to
celebrate his natiuitie, who was to bring again vnto
the worlde, such tymes, or rather better, then in
which <hi>Saturne</hi> raigned, and as by the effusion of
his moste precious bloud, the first day of the yeare
had a newe consecration, which was before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with vain pastimes in honour of <hi>Ianus,</hi> so
now in Februarie, wherein they vsed their lupercals
either to purge the vnclean spirits, or to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with vnseemly sports, both the virgin was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
because she would not haue it knowne howe
litle she needed it, and the yong prince was offered,
who doubted not afterward to make himself a most
gratefull sacrifice, thereby to chaunge these sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
superstitions, into a moste sacred solemnitie,
likely to teach them also some newe kinde of
tryumph in March, in which Moneth theyr
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19856:78"/>
priestes which song and daunce, marched vp and
downe in the streetes in armour.</p>
            <p>But before the virgin and her spouse had disge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
these sodaine ioyes, which hapned vnto them
in the Temple, new dangers were set before them,
insomuch as that their owne experience might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
haue taught them, if they could not haue
told before, that mourning is alwayes at one end
of myrth, <hi>Ioseph</hi> his iealousie swallowed vppe his
first ioy hee had in his spouse, their grieuous win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
iourney, made him bewayle her wombes groth,
their gladnesse at this childes birth, was checked
with an inconuenient abode, the shepheards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation
was soone choked with the childs cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
the kings oblation of golde and fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kensence,
was not perfected without mirrhe, and
now that they haue beene at the Temple, and heard
what ioy these made which did but see him, who
was theirs, a message commeth, which to shew the
more hast, commeth by night, and vrgeth <hi>Ioseph</hi>
to arise and take the childe, and the childs mother,
and flye into <hi>Egypt,</hi> for that <hi>Herod</hi> would make
search after the childe to kill him.</p>
            <p>The message being deliuered vnto <hi>Ioseph,</hi> he lost
little time, but rose, and tooke the childe and his
mother by night, and went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where
they remained not onely vntill the massacre was
ended, but also vntill that <hi>Herod</hi> was dead.</p>
            <p>Then were many Oracles vnderstood, and one
principall prophesie was fulfilled, that the Lorde
should ascend vppon a light cloude, and should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19856:78"/>
into Egypt, and the Idols of Egypt should bee
ouerthrowne, and the heart of Egypt should lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
in the middle thereof, for when the sonne
of God became a man, he was in some sort hidden,
that his glorie was not seene, and the flesh which
hee tooke was likened vnto a light cloude, either
because flesh is of it selfe no more lasting then is a
thin cloude, which with euery little winde is dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
or else because he was of no lesse power when
he was in that cloude, then he was before.</p>
            <p>At his comming into Egypt, some affirme that
all the Idols in Egypt fell downe, others say, that
onely one in euerie Temple, as at the departure of
the Israelites from Egypt, one dyed in euerie
house: some write, that onely those fell downe,
which wer at <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in <hi>Thebais,</hi> whether the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
went with her sonne to dwell: certaine it is,
that a huge great tree was not farre from the Citie,
whose fruit, leaues, or barke did heale many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
and no other cause was euer giuen thereof,
then that it receiued this vertue myraculously,
when the yong prince passed by it at his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
at what time it bowed downe vnto the
ground, and was dispossessed of an euill spirite,
which was woont there to bee honoured by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,
and all this is no wonder to those, who
read that <hi>Dagon</hi> (the Idoll which the Philistins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored)
was founde first lying vpon the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Arke of God (which they took in a battell
from the Iewes, and had placed it in <hi>Dagons</hi> temple
at <hi>Aso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s)</hi> and the second time the body of the Idoll
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19856:79"/>
was in his place as they had set it vp againe, but the
head and hands were off<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and lay before the arch. If
the arch were of such vertue (being a thing made of
wood made by <hi>Moses</hi> at Gods commaundement to
keep the law, which he gaue vnto the Israelites) that
an Idoll could not stand in the presence therof, how
coulde any Idols stande in the presence of an arch
made without mans hand<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and where God himselfe
was personally present? For into Egypt came now
neither <hi>Abraham, Iacob, Moses,</hi> nor <hi>Ieremie,</hi> but one
who was greater then euer was any of the patriarks,
or prophets, and therefore no wonder, if Egypt felt
such an alteration as neuer before. That this yong
prince dwelt in <hi>Heliopolis</hi> a worthy fountaine not far
from thence witnessed, wherein it is said the virgin
washed the yong prince, and such things as she vsed
about him, it was in a garden where grewe nothing
but that which was most precious. For in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
was nothing but Balsam, &amp; it had no other water
but of that fountain to water it, &amp; the garden being
afterward made greater, the inhabitants thereabout
digged a greater place for the watering thereof, near
vnto the other little fountaine, perswading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
that there was some speciall vertue therein for
this purpose, and that their Well which they dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
being neare vnto it, might be the better for it,
but they all were deceyued of their expectation, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they made certaine Pipes by which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
water out of the little fountane into their
Well, and mingled it with other water, which
sprung fast by it, in remembraunce of which, both
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19856:79"/>
that place, and the place where the virgin dwelled,
were had in great reuerence by the heathen people,
for they sawe a manifest signe that his bodie gaue
vertue vnto that fountain, when as the water which
was digged close by it had no such vertue in it.</p>
            <p>This sequell perchance made the Egyptians to
reflect the more vpon their Idols fall, both in their
Temples, and elsewhere, and called to minde what
they had beene before also informed by one, who
although he were a Iew, and stoned to death by his
owne countrymen in Egypt (because hee foretolde
them they should all die by sworde and famine,
which descended into Egypt after the destruction
of their Temple by the Chaldees) yet he was highly
esteemed of by all the Egyptians, for that by his
prayers hee deliuered all that coast where he came,
from Cocatrices (pernitious water serpents) &amp; from
Aspides, which were so wily, that if at any time the
enchanter were about to charme them (thereby to
take away their force in hurting them) they woulde
lay one of their eares so close to the ground, and stop
the other so fast with their taile, that the enchanter
could not in any sort preuaile against them.</p>
            <p>The Oracle which this prophet gaue them, was
that when a virgin should bring forth a sonne their
Idols should be destroied, which being beleeued by
the priests, they erected in the most secret place of
their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ple the Image of a virgin with a child in her
arms &amp; adored it, which <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> their K. (for <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the great made <hi>Ptolo.</hi> K. of Egypt, &amp; after him
the K. of Egypt were called <hi>Ptolome,</hi> as before they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19856:80"/>
all called <hi>Pharao)</hi> when hee demaunded what it
meant, they sayde as before is shewed, and that
their predecessors had left such a tradition amonge
them, and that they beleeued it, and no doubt that
Image did stand still in their temple, for the honor
they bore vnto the Prophet, whom after the Iewes
had stoned, the Egyptians buried close by theyr
Kings, but afterward <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his body with exceeding great pompe vnto
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> that by the presence thereof, those
Serpents shoulde auoyde, which by no other
pollicie hee could ouercome, notwithstanding
that hee had brought other kind of sepents out of
Greece to destroy them.</p>
            <p>But after that this blessed virgin and her childe
were come into Egypt, <hi>Herod</hi> returning from <hi>Rome</hi>
as most men affirme, either from making complaint
of his sonnes <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> or from
aunswering to theyr complaints made vppon him
to the Emperor, and not knowing this yong prince
where to finde, but mistrusting onely, that hee
was some where about <hi>Bethlcem,</hi> sent to murder all
the infants which were in <hi>Bethleem</hi> &amp; neere about,
so that <hi>Beniamin,</hi> as some doe thinke, bordering
vpon that part of <hi>Iuda,</hi> lost also some of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
according to the olde prophesie. A voyce
of weeping and howling was heard in <hi>Rama, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi>
bewayling her children, and would not bee
comforted because they were not, that is to say,
because shee was spoyled of them, for <hi>Beniamin</hi> was
the yongest sonne of <hi>Rachel,</hi> and the yongest of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19856:80"/>
twelue patriarches, some doe thinke that <hi>Rama</hi>
was a towne betwixt <hi>Bethleem</hi> and <hi>Hebron,</hi> and
that <hi>Zacharias</hi> vpon ryot of this murder, conuayed
away his sonne, for which hee was afterward
slaine himselfe. Some say, that this <hi>Rama</hi> was a
towne in Arabia, whose name was vsed to shewe
how farre in a short time this crueltye was spred
abroade. Some do thinke that <hi>Rama</hi> signified
nothing but the vehemencie of the crye, which
might very well bee, for 14000. infants were slain
in this massacre, and as some do thinke, onely the
infants of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and that <hi>Rachel</hi> is by the Prophet
sayd to lament her children, not because that anie
of the tribe of <hi>Beniamin</hi> were slaine, but because
that shee lay buried neere vnto the place, where
this murder was principally doone, (which was
doone vpon all of twoo yeeres old, to fiue yeeres
old, as some haue thought) because the childrens
bones which were after seene, seemed to bee of a
greater growth then twoo yeeres: others, who
thinke that children were bigger at that time, then
they were in a short time after, say all were slaine
which were of two yeeres and vnder, which also
some do limit, saying that none were slaine, who
were vnder 40. dayes olde, because <hi>Herod</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that the Prince was borne when the three
Kings were with him, which was about fortie
dayes before this murder, and these doe suppose,
that the murder was done presently after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
in the Temple, but this limitation hath
more pittie then pith in it, for if the Souldiours
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19856:81"/>
were debarred from killing those who were but
fortie dayes olde or vnder, could they distinguish
better betwixt one childes age <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> another of
fortie dayes, and anothers of fortie fiue dayes, or
fiftie dayesx, then betwixt one of fortie dayes, and
one of two yeeres old? if they were so cunning to
distinguish one age from another, which differed
but three or foure dayes, why were children of two
yeeres olde murdered, for one little aboue fortie
dayes olde? if they were not so cunning to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
what securitie was it for <hi>Herod</hi> to kill some,
and leaue other aliue, who might very well be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for foure or fiue dayes yonger then they were?
Wherefore it is more probable, that all were slaine
which were twoo yeares olde or vnder, for <hi>Herod</hi>
assured himselfe, as hee might verie well, both by
the Prince his presentation in the Temple, and
also by the appearing of the starre, that the childe
hee sought for was vnder those yeeres, and not
knowing howe to sette a limit vnder that time,
which could bee obserued for his purpose, hee
might thinke it little more crueltie, then hee did
principally intend to kill them all, beside that hee
might thinke, that some for some bribes might
bee fauoured, the souldiours hauing so iust an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
as a precise commaundement to kill such,
and no other, and the younge Prince as well as
any other, might by these meanes escape, beeing
aboue a yeere olde, and thought to bee verie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
in growth, hauing in <hi>Herods</hi> conceite, more
helpe by the influence of the starres, then other
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19856:81"/>
children, and the more, because hee vnderstoode
that a starre did in a sort attende vpon him at his
birth, and this cause doe somegiue, why hee took
so large a scope in the age of those, whome he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to bee murdered, for hee thought the starres
would make him looke yonger or older then hee
was, for his aduantage, although others impute it
altogether to <hi>Herods</hi> crueltie, which depriued him
so much of reason, as in this commission he would
not except his owne sonne, but suffered him also
to bee murdered among the infants, perchance ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him for this cause, that being an infant, he was
like vnto the Prince whome hee feared. The shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
their tale was heard, wher they had reported
abroad this childs birth, &amp; helde for no more then a
tale, because it chanced at such a time, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
and Iewes by their imitation, vsed to watch al
the night. For an ancient custome was among them
to keep watches twice in the yeere, at what time
the nights were at the longest, &amp; at the shortest, and
spent them perchance in some kinde of pastime,
and this watch did the Gentiles keepe (as some
doe write) in honour of the sunne.</p>
            <p>The three Kinges, their so straunge a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> for him, who was borne
King of the Iewes, draue <hi>Herod</hi> into a little feare,
but theyr silent departure made him thinke that
they missed what they sought for, and therefore
the more secure, but when the Prince was openly
proclaimed in no obscure place, but in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ple, &amp;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19856:82"/>
not in a corner, but in an open assemblie, <hi>Herod</hi>
beganne to bee exceedingly troubled, and hauing
a present witte, especially in any wicked practise,
determined rather then to misse him, that
all the children in <hi>Bethleem</hi> or neere about,
should bee murdered, but deferred it vntill his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
from Rome (as many doe say) perchance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in his absence hee doubted, eyther that
it would not bee doone vnto his minde, or else
that it might cause some tumult among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or thirdlye, because hee would not haue this
obiected against him when hee should come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But heere may seeme some doubt why the
Virgin should flie into Egypt for succour, beeing
at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> for the sacred Historie sayth, shee
went thither so soone as all thinges were ended in
the Temple, which was foure dayes iourney from
<hi>Bethleem,</hi> where (as it appeareth) shee was in suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
securitie with her childe, to which may hee
aunswered, that although <hi>Herod</hi> were enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that the Prince he feared, was to bee
borne in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and that from <hi>Bethleem</hi> the
childe came, of whom, at his presentation in the
Temple, so many thinges both admirable, and
woorthie eternall memorie were spoken, yet could
hee not bee ignorant (whome feare made ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious,
and to search out whatsoeuer might
make for his purpose) of an olde prophesie that
was amongst the Iewes, that is to saye,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:19856:82"/>
A sprig shall spring from the root of <hi>Iesse,</hi> and out of
this sprig shall come a floure, or as some did reade it
a Nazarene, so that it was conuenient that the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
shoulde remoue the Prince from Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
which <hi>Herode</hi> after his returne by diligent
search hauing founde: but not whither they
were remoued, and imagining that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> or thereabout, because they
were of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> he resolued to send his sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
thither to kill all the infants of two yeares old,
and vnder. But after this murther <hi>Herode</hi> grew odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in <hi>Palestina,</hi> and infamous in all the world, in so
much as the Emperor, who had before a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the man, said by way of mocking, that he had
rather be <hi>Herods</hi> hog, then his sonne: for the Iewes
did not kill any swines flesh, either for the temple or
for their owne priuate vses, because they accounted
those beasts as vncleane, and therefore not to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
for euery beast (saith their law) which doth not
chew the cud, &amp; hath not the foot cloue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, is vnclean,
by which the Hare although it chew the cudde,
yet because it hath an whole foote is counted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
&amp; the hog which hath a clouen foot, because
it doth not chaw the cud is also vncleane.</p>
            <p>But neither were hogs kept in <hi>Palestina,</hi> vntil such
had power ouer it, as were not vnder the Iewes
lawes, &amp; then were the Iewes contented (being for
this cause priuiledged in other things aboue others)
to keep hogs for others vses. And these obseruations
were not onely for beasts, but for fishes, which were
al accounted vncleane, which had not both fins &amp;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:19856:83"/>
scales, &amp; also for fowles: among which some were
forbidden. which among other people are vsed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,
some seldome, either in respect of dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the meat, or curiousnes of the eaters, as Swan,
Puet, a sea foule like to a sea gull, Crowes, Hawkes,
Owles, &amp; many other, which perchance in far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
elswhere were accounted good meat: as Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins,
Kites, Ostriches, Eagles, &amp; other strange birds
which breed in <hi>Egipt</hi> or thereabout. Generally all
flying things which had foure legs, were iudged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
vnlesse they had their hinder legs longer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
their forelegs.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Herode</hi> his good fortune was such, as all things
still chanced as he wished: and whereas <hi>Caesar</hi> was
thought by some to giue him a mocke, <hi>Caesar</hi> (he
thought) did highly commend him, for by <hi>Caesars</hi>
words <hi>Herode</hi> was noted to be so strickt an obseruer
of the law he professed, as he wold preferre it before
his sons life, yet was it manifest vnto the Iewes, that
<hi>Herod</hi> wold not spare to kil, yea &amp; to eat swines flesh,
if by eating therof he could haue found any sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
for all his religion was meere policy, &amp; he caried
onely a shew of religion to win mens mindes vnto
him. He built a goodly temple in the place of that
which the Iews built after they returned from their
captiuitie in <hi>Babilon,</hi> but hee shewed with what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
when hee erected a golden Eagle vpon the
great gate of the temple: for pulling downe of
which (as a thing not tollerable by the Iewes lawes
that any image shold be dedicated in their temple)
many were put to death, and peraduenture more
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19856:83"/>
should, if he had liued longer, for howsoeuer he got
the fauours of forraine people, he lost ordinarily the
harts of all the Iewes, for beside the great taxes and
aduantages which hee got of the people to enrich
himselfe, by which riches he purchased straungers
good will, he was alwaies exceeding cruell vnto his
seruants. But due punishment for his crueltie, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that murder of the infants, was not altogether
deferred vntill after this life, for long before he died
he had a most odious disease, &amp; such as was so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
vnto him, that if others had not staid him, hee
had in one of his pangs slaine himselfe. His disease
tooke him with an extreame heate in all his bodie,
so that his bowels were consumed, he fed greedily
without any intermission, his entrailes were excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
fore, and hee was troubled with an extreame
collicke: his feet &amp; his grines swelled, his members
rotted, being full of wormes, with the which they
had both a filthy stifnes, &amp; gaue out an intollerable
stinke: his sinewes were shrunke, and his breath he
drew very short. After that the phisitions told him
that he was past their cure, hee was carried beyond
the riuer <hi>Iordan,</hi> to a citie called <hi>Callirhoe,</hi> neere vnto
which is a great rock, hauing as they were two teats
of equall height from the ground, &amp; not far one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
the other, out of which ran two sorts of waters, one
extreme hot &amp; sweet, the other as cold and bitter,
which meeting together made a pleasant medlie to
drinke, &amp; were also very medicinable for many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
especially for shrunke sinewes. Here did <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
bath himselfe, but to so small purpose, that being
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19856:84"/>
set afterward in a bathing tub full of oyle to refresh
him, he fainted, and recouered not himselfe, but by
the outcrie of those which were about him then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
he to thinke he should die, and returning from
thence to <hi>Hiericho</hi> he made his will, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his sonne <hi>Achelaus</hi> king, and made his other
sonnes princes of diuers places in <hi>Palestina:</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
a great quantity of mony to the Emperor
and to the Empresse, beside great store of plate, both
of siluer and gold, &amp; very rich ornaments: he distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
largely among his soldiers and friends, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for all vnto their contentment, &amp; after he had
setled himselfe to die, he remembred that he was so
much hated of all the Iewes, that whereas at the
death of princes much mourning is in all their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
contrariwise at his death would bee as
much ioy: therefore that he might bee honoured
with teares after his departure, he commanded that
all the nobilitie of <hi>Palestina</hi> should vppon paine of
death come vnto him: with whome after he had a
while quarelled, he sent them to be kept in an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phytheater,
with this charge vnto his trustiest and
dearest friends (his sister <hi>Salome</hi> as some think &amp; her
husband, but others think he had caused the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> also to
be murdered before) that as soone as he were dead,
&amp; before his death were knowne abroad, all those
Iewes should in that place be slaine: but the ioy he
conceiued of this (although it did him very great
ease) was not able to make him forget his owne
griefe, but in a raging impatiencie woulde haue
slain himself with a knife, for which he called to pare
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19856:84"/>
an apple, as he vsed to do in the time of his sicknesse
had not <hi>Achiabus</hi> his nephew stayed his hand, and
not long after hee finished a most hatefull life, yet
according as he had liued in exceeding great pomp,
his body was buried with great honour.</p>
            <p>The litter on which his body was laid, was of
golde, adorned with very rich and pretious stones,
it was couered with purple, as also his body was,
he had a diademe on his head, and a crowne of gold
ouer that, hee had also a scepter in his hand, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and kinsmen were round about his body, next
to them went his guarde and champions, first, the
Thracians, then the Germaines, after these went the
Frenchmen, then came the whole armie lead by
their Captaines and Centurions all in warlike man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
after those went fiue hundred of his seruantes,
carrying sweet perfumes, which order they kept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they came to <hi>Herodium</hi> (a castle built by himselfe
before, not farre distant from <hi>Ierico)</hi> where hee was
interred, but the Iewes whome hee had caused to
bee shut vp in the Theater to bee slaine, were all let
goe after his death, and a gratefull message came
to <hi>Ioseph</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> by night in his sleepe, that he shold
rise and take the child and his mother, and returne
into <hi>Palestina,</hi> because they were all deade which
sought the childe to murder him, which <hi>Ioseph</hi> flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
not, but as soone as he heard that <hi>Archelaus</hi> did
rule in <hi>Iuda,</hi> he was afraide to go thether, and being
in the same manner vrged againe, hee went to <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi>

which laboured much to be deliuered from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
vnder which they had liued being vnder his

at Easter (when from all partes of the world came
Iewes to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to solemnize that feast) had slain
about three thousand and commaunded al to leaue
of their accustomed deuotions, and returne vnto
their owne countries: but his chiefest aduersarie
was his brother <hi>Antipas,</hi> who claimed the kingdom
by his fathers will, which was made when hee was
in health, and would haue disprooued his Fathers

            <p>The cause of this strife betwixt these two breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
for the kingdome, was <hi>Herods</hi> their fathers rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
who in his life time appointed now one, then
an other, almost all his sonnes for kinges, first hee
ment that the kingdome should descend from him
vnto his sonnes <hi>Alexander,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> whome he
had by <hi>Mariamnes</hi> grandchild to <hi>Hircanus'</hi> the last
king of the Iewes, but his eldest son <hi>Antipater</hi> (whom
he had by <hi>Doris</hi> a base woman) being prouoked of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
by the contemptuous speeches of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for whose mothers loue his mother was reiected
deuised how he might both take reuenge vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
and aduance himselfe, whereof first hee wrought
meanes by the discredite of the princes to come a
little into his Fathers fauour, which when hee had
gotten so farre as his Father put him before the two
princes in the right of the kingdome, hee vsed mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in that sort, that <hi>Herod</hi> hauing by his sleight and
his friends, put <hi>Mariamnes</hi> to death, now also by his
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19856:86"/>
false suggestions murdered his two sonnes which he
had by her, then was <hi>Antipater</hi> honoured as a king
by all, for <hi>Herod</hi> gaue ouer vnto him the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the countrie in such manner as he kept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himselfe little more then the bare title of a king
which <hi>Antipater</hi> also thought was too much, yet
first he stirred vp his father what he coulde against
<hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> two other of his brethren, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
sought meanes to poison his Father, which being
perceiued by <hi>Herod,</hi> hee presently chaunged his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
will (by which hee had giuen the kingdome to
<hi>Antipater)</hi> and being offended with <hi>Archelaus</hi> and
<hi>Philip</hi> by <hi>Antipaters</hi> meanes, hee made <hi>Antipas</hi> his
successor in this kingdom, but before hee dyed (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
manifest proofe of <hi>Antipaters</hi> treasons against
him) he repented too late his cruelty which now he
mistrusted was without cause against <hi>Mariamnes</hi> &amp;
her children, and, accounting all which proceeded
from <hi>Antipater</hi> to haue beene false accusations to
further himselfe in the kingdome, he chaunged his
will, and deuided the countrie into foure partes, &amp;
made foure Tetrarches ouer it, but the chiefest part
he left to <hi>Archclaus,</hi> whome he set downe in his last
wil for his successor, (if <hi>Caesar</hi> shold think him meet)
and not aboue fiue dayes before his death caused
<hi>Antipater</hi> to be executed and buried obscurely, for
as he had many causes for which hee thought hee
might worthily haue put him to death before, so
would he not vpon any of them execute him with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
<hi>Caesars</hi> consent, to whome hee had signified by
letters what <hi>Antipater</hi> had attempted and wrought
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19856:86"/>
against him, and how that in his treasons he had v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the helpe of <hi>Acme,</hi> who attended vpon <hi>Iulia</hi> the
Empresse, to which letters <hi>Caesar</hi> aunswered that
<hi>Acme</hi> being found guiltie at <hi>Rome,</hi> was executed as
she had deserued, and that <hi>Antipater</hi> was now at
his Fathers discretion to order him as hee would
which was no small comfort vnto him in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of his sicknes, wherefore hee determined that
<hi>Antipater</hi> should die, which intention vpon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
was put in execution. When <hi>Herod</hi> (beeing
in an extreame fitte of his sicknesse) would haue
slaine himselfe, and was hindered by <hi>Achiabus,</hi>
who was his nephew. <hi>Achiabus</hi> (notwithstanding
hee had preuented the stroake) gaue so great a
skritch, that all in the pallace thought <hi>Herod</hi> had
beene dead. And <hi>Antipater,</hi> who was not farre off
(although a prisoner) hearing those newes, dealt
with his keeper to lette him goe at libertie, as not
doubting to gette the kingbome within a shorte
time, and to the end he might perswade the more
easily, hee promised great gifts both then, and for
afterward. But this keeper, either for feare of <hi>Herod,</hi>
or for little loue to <hi>Antipater,</hi> went presently to
<hi>Herod,</hi> and declared his sonnes attempt, for which
<hi>Herod</hi> in his rage commaunded him presently to
bee slaine, so that now remained the other twoo
willes which <hi>Herod</hi> made to bee tryed which of
them were of force, but <hi>Caesar</hi> decided the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie,
and the two brerhren vppon this conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
returned from Rome to <hi>Palestina,</hi> where <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi>
as well before as after his voyage, did so little
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19856:87"/>
degenerate from his father, that gladde were they
who were out of his dominion, which was the
cause why <hi>Ioseph</hi> auoyded his owne countrey, and
went directly to <hi>Nazareth</hi> with his charge, from
whence euerie yeare for deuotion sake, they went
to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to the Temple, especially at the feast
of Easter, for many feasts did the Iewes obserue,
and no one passed them without great solemnitie.
Some of them might not bee celebrated but in <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
some againe might bee obserued els where
wheresoeuer the Iewes dwelt.</p>
            <p>Their Sabaoth they did celebrate euerie seuenth
day, a daye solemne from the beginning of the
world, sanctified by God himselfe, and called
the sabaoth, because then hee ceased from creating
the world, and the complements thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Iewes alwayes (except when they were in
Egypt) and all theyr auncestors, kept the seuenth
day holy, in remembrance that after sixe dayes, in
which all things were created, God rested the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
day, which although perchance when they
were in Egypt they minded not, and in time forgot
it, being so long in bondage, where they could not
vse that honour vnto God vpon that day, as theyr
fathers had taught them, yet were they assured, that
was the day when they were in the wildernesse, by
the myracle which chaunced so oft vnto them, that
in the end they did by theyr murmur seeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
it, for when they wanted victuall in the
desart, God sent down vnto them like raine a food,
which because they knewe not else what to call it,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19856:87"/>
they called it Manna, which woord was in euerie
mans mouth, when they first saw it, and signifieth
what is this, it fell sixe dayes, and the seuenth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
fell, but vppon the sixt day it fell in greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance,
then any other day, that the people
might gather sufficientlye to serue them the same
day and the next. Vpon this which they called
sabaoth, it was not lawfull for them to doe anye
worke, no, not to prouide or dresse any meate for
their sustenaunce, for confirmation of which, they
did see weekely that what Manna they gathered v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the sixt day, was as good vpon the seuenth day
as when they gathered it, wheras the Manna which
was gathered vppon any other day, was eaten with
wormes by the next morning, and this their saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth
day is our Saturday.</p>
            <p>By this name of sabaoth also they call the weeke,
and accounted the morrow after the sabaoth, the
first of the sabaoth, and so forward vnto the sixt of
the sabaoth, which because then they prepared
theyr victuall readie to be eaten the next day,
they called the <hi>Parasceue</hi> of the sabaoth, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
they called all their feates sabaoths. But there
was one sabaoth among them, which many doubt
what kinde of holyday it was, they called it a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
first sabaoth. Some say it was a sabaoth
which fel next after another holiday. Some do say it
was a sabaoth which fell the next day before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
holiday. Some say that that word first doth not
signifie any order, in number, but in dignitie, &amp; that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:19856:88"/>
meaning of the second first Sabaoth, may bee of a
Sabaoth, which was a chiefe Sabaoth, but not so
great as another might be, such were the Sabaoths
which lighted within the Octaues of some great
feast, and were called great Sabaoths, but when
the first day of the feast, being (no doubt) greater
then the other, lighted vppon a Sabaoth, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth
was greater, then if the second daye of the
feast should light vpon the Sabaoth, and if there
were any difference betwixt the solemnitie of the
first day of the feast, and the last day, then may
such a Sabaoth, being the Octaue of a feast, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the second chiefest Sabaoth, because
none could bee greater then that but one, vppon
which should fall the first day of the feast. So that
the second first-sabaoth, may bee sayde to bee the
second chiefe Sabaoth, that is, either a Sabaoth
within the Octaues of a feast, or else the Octaue
it selfe, if it fell on a Sabaoth day.</p>
            <p>The Sabaoths, as also all other their feasts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
the euening before the day, and continued
vntill the euening of the same day: the euening
was then thought to beginne, when the shepheards
starre appeared, and to euery day belonged but
one euening, so that when it is sayd from euening
to euening they celebrated their feasts, it is to be
vnderstood from the begining of the first, to the
beginning of the next euening, for then was it
lawfull for them to worke.</p>
            <p>A greater difficultie it is, how farre the Iewes
might walke vpon this Sabaoth, for as they were
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19856:88"/>
restrayned from dressing any meate (which vppon
all other holydayes they might, except theyr day
of expiation. So likewise it was lawfull for them to
walke, but with in certaine limits, which some haue
thought did extend vnto twoo mile, and prooue
it by tradition from the Iewes: some saye it did
extend but vnto two thousand cubits, and prooue
it by the order which the Iews obserued in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
because they fixed their tents so farre
from the tabernacle, whether no doubt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred
vppon the Sabboath, others because that
an infallible truth hath reuealed that the mount O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuet
was a sabaoth dayes iourney from <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
which mount was scantly two hundred foot from
the Cittie, doe thinke that this was their stint, and
they doe confirme it by the tradition of the Iewes,
who affirme that their Rabbins so taught them, but
how much, or how little so euer it was, no doubt
the Iewes were as precise in obseruing it, as in other
things belonging vnto the Sabaoth, which rather
then they would not most strictly obserue, they
would offer themselues to bee slaine, as once it
chaunced at Sea, where a Iewe holding the sterne,
as soone as hee perceiued the sunne set vpon Friday
at night, left it, and lay prostrate vpon the ground,
not without amaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ng all other in the shippe, who
thought that they had beene in some desperate
dannger of theyr liues, but when they vnderstood
that hee did it for Religion sake, as who would do
no worke vpon the sabaoth day then new begun,
one ranne to him with a sword, and threatned to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19856:89"/>
kil him, if he tooke not againe the sterne in hand, but
his threates were in vaine, for the Iewe would not
worke vntill he was sure the Sabaoth was past. And
in the hystorie of the Machabees it is shewed, that a
thousand suffered themselues to bee slaine by <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
his souldiers, who knew the Iewes would not
strike that day in their owne defence, which when
<hi>Mathathias</hi> perceiued, aud conceiued, that if they
did keepe their Sabaoth so strictly in this point, that
all the Iewes might bee slaine without any battaile,
hee exhorted the rest not to stande vpon any nice
points, which grewe rather vpon too much scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousnesse,
then vpon the true meaning of the law.
So that when the next sabaoth came, and the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
assaulted them as they did before, thinking to
haue murdered them without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>istaunce, the Iewes
did not onely defend themselues, but also offended
their enemies, and gaue them a bloudie ouerthrow
and thought it no breach of their sabaoth, when
they sawe by the contrarie obseruation that both
the people, and their lawe would quicklie haue
an ende.</p>
            <p>And other solemnitie was among the Iews, which
they called the feast of <hi>Neomenia,</hi> that is, the feast of
the new Moone, or the first day of the Moone, for
the Iewes reckoned their Moneths from the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
of the moon, vntil it did appeare again after
once it left to appeare, for the discrying of which,
they had euery where in their sinagogues (that is to
say) their places where they met togither at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions)
a high tower into which one did ascende,
with a trumpet in his hand at the sunne set, next day
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:19856:89"/>
after they knewe the coniunction of the sunne and
the Moone: and as soone as he saw the Moone, hee
sounded his trumpet, by which he gaue all the Iews
in that place, to vnderstande the beginning of the
new moneth, this account did they alwayes obserue
concerning the moone, without any respect either
to her natural course, which is from west toward the
east, and in 27. daies and 8. houres, returneth to the
same point from whence it went, or to the time in
which it doth appear in her violent course, from the
east to the west, for that time is no more than 28.
daies, but alwaies to her coniunction with the sun,
which is once in 29. daies, &amp; 12, houres, and because
those od 12, houres should breed no confusion, they
added to euery second month 1. day, so that the first
month was alwaies of 29. dayes, &amp; the second of 30.
and in this sort they did account 12. monthes in the
yeeare. But because in a short time, according vnto
this account a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fusion might be of times, this yeare
of 12. months thus reckoned wanting 11. daies eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
yeare of the course of the sunne, to accorde their
yeares with the yeare of the sunne in 19. yeares they
added 7. months, 6, months of 30. daies, &amp; one of 29.
dayes, which amount iust vnto the number of the
11. daies which in euery one of the 19: years do wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
in that other reckning: for in 19. years of 12. months
in the year, according to the Iewes account, the sun
had gotten 19. times 11. daies, which amount to
two hundred and nine dayes, and these monthes
added, one sometime to some third, and sometime
an other to some second yeare of the nintenth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to as manie dayes, so that in the 19. yeare
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19856:90"/>
the yeere of the sunne and the yeere of the moone,
by the Iewes account did perfectly agree.</p>
            <p>The day of their Neomenia (that is, ahe first day
of the moone was kept holyday, but so as any man
might worke therein, and those which would not,
might bee present at the sacrifice then offered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily

how graciously God delt with them in Egypt, the

or as some thinke, not onely the first begotten, for

a kid the same night killed, and eaten in the house,
was obserued the fourteenth day of the first moone
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19856:90"/>
in the yeare, and that Moone they did alwayes
account the first in the yeare, whose firste daye
was nearest vnto the Equinoctiall in the Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
spring time: for before this solemnitie was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
they accounted their beginning of their
yeare at the other Equinocticall according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the Egyptians, which account they did
not altogether afterward neglect, but vsed it in their
secular affayres, as they vsed this other in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
ceremonies, and called the one a holy yeare,
and the other a secular yeare.</p>
            <p>This holy yeare was instituted by God himself,
and promulgated by <hi>Moses,</hi> and was obserued in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
that in this moneth they were brought
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Egypt, &amp; this feast was celebrated in this maner.</p>
            <p>Vpon the 14. day of that moone at the sunne set,
or before, they had ready a lambe, or a kid of a yeare
old, or vnder, cleare from all disease, both in the skin
and body, and after that it was offered vnto God,
(which the Priests did by lifting it vp before God)
it should be killed, rosted &amp; eaten in the same house,
and if they were not sufficient in the house to eate
a lambe, or a kidde, they should call in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
(alwayes prouided that they were Iews) or
at the least Proselites (that is, circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cised if they were
Gentiles before) which was a great helpe vnto the
poore, who were not able to buy a lambe, or, a
kidde: they might not cast away anie part of the
lambe or kidde, but after they had washed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes,
they put them in again, and rosted it whole
from the heade vnto the feete, neyther might they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:19856:91"/>
breake any bone thereof, or seeth any part: they
were to eate it with vnleauened bread, and wild let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuse,
they had staues in their handes, and shooes on
their feet (a thing not vsed in their feasts, for at feasts
they sat barefoote) whereby they woulde signifie,
that they did eat in haste, and were readie to bee
gone, and therefore they did not sit but stood at this
feast: wherefore when wee reade of some who
did rise to wash others feete after this feast, it is
not to be vnderstoode, that they did rise immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after this feast, for they were vp, and stoode
at it (although the phrase might beare it, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
newe thing is attempted) but they did rise from
the supper which was vsually made after this feast:
this being instituted to fulfill a ceremonie rather
then to fill the bellie: and the same custome conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
a long time after, that the thing it selfe was
vsed, of which this was partly a figure, if any of the
lambe, or kidde remayned not eaten, it was to bee
burned the next morning: if the householde were
verie great, that a lambe could not satisfie their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
it was not lawfull for them to kill any more then
one in this ceremonie: but they might afterward eat
what they would to satisfie them. Yet some haue
thought that no moe, nor fewer then ten persons
might be at the eating of a lambe.</p>
            <p>This holy day began when the lambes or kiddes
beganne to bee offered, andx ended when the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
was come, yet they might eate of the lambe
vntill midnight, notwithstanding that the same eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
an other feast was begun, which continued 8.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:19856:91"/>
dayes, and was called the feast of vnleauened bread,
because it was not lawfull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to haue any other
in the house all that time. It was also called Phase,
as the former feast was, &amp; by the same name wer the
sacrifices called, which were offered in those dayes
of the feast, and the like conditions were required of
puritie, in those which eate of them, for as they
were commaunded vnder paine of death to eate
their pascall lambe, so might they not eate it, if they
had contracted any vncleannesse by touching any
dead body, wherfore in such case it was lawfull for
them to keepe the next moneth, and keepe this feast
then according vnto their rites prescribed.</p>
            <p>In this feast of their Phase, they kept the first day
and the last so holy, that in them they might doe no
other work, then dresse meate, vpon the second day
(vnlesse it were the sabaoth) they gathered of the
ripest of the barley, and after they had scorched the
sheafe in the fire, they grinded the corne, &amp; brought
the quantity of 4. pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d weight, which they mingled
with oyle, &amp; offered it with frankensence, as the first
fruits of the earth, partly in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>brance that at such
a time they came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Egypt, partly in thanksgiuing
vnto God for their increase, which the priests took
and throwing some of the flower and oyle into the
fire, also all the frankensence, they kept the rest of
the flowre and the oyle to their owne vse.</p>
            <p>The cause why their phase had so short a solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and their feast of sweete bread so long, is for
that their first phase was no longer, and they eate
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:19856:92"/>
of vnleaue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ed bread a long time, and this order
did they alwayes keept, that what feast they did
celebrate in remembrance of that which chaunced
but once, or for one day, they did keepe but one day
solemne for it; and for that which chanced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dayes, they kept their Octaues, and therefore
they celebrated also their feast of Penticost in one
day, because the fifteth day after they were come
into the wildernes, God did appeare vnto them v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and gaue them the law, so that
this fifteth day was not accounted after the eating
of the Lamb, but after the offring of the first fruits
in the Temple, which was the thirde day after the
eating of the Lambe, in which day they entred
into the wildernesse.</p>
            <p>In the feast of Penticost they offered wheate
corne, euerie one two loaues, but with leauen, of
foure pound weight a loafe, at what time also they
offered other sacrifices vnto God for his benefites,
but some of the cattell when the priestes had lifted
them vp, were to the priests vse, and all the bread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was not lawfull to sacrifice any leuen vnto
God. In their seuenth month of their yeere, which
they called their holy yeere, they had 4 solemnities.
First they celebrated the first daye of the moneth
as in all other moneths, with the sound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
and other musicke, with this onely difference,
that in remembrance of the sacrifice of the ramme,
which hung by the hornes in the brambies, on the
top of the mountaine <hi>Morea,</hi> &amp; was offered in place
of <hi>Isaac,</hi> whom by Gods commandement <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:19856:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had sacrificed, had he not beene at that time coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanded:
the Iews did in this solemnitie sound
their rammes hornes, thanking God for <hi>Isaac</hi> his
deliuerie, and hoping of like fauour, whensoeuer
they should bee in like affliction. The second feast
in this moneth was the day of Expiation, which
was as strictly obserued as the sabaoth. It was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in remembrance of Gods mercie towarde
them, after they had fallen into Idolatrie at mounte
<hi>Sinai,</hi> where they adored the golden calfe, of which
mercye they had a manifest signe, when <hi>Moses</hi> as
that day brought vnto them the tables wherein the
law was written the seconde time, for when it was
written, <hi>Moyses</hi> offended with their Idolatrie, brake
the tables which he had receiued of God.</p>
            <p>Vpon this day only did the high Priest, &amp; no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
but hee, enter into the holyest place of the Temple
with the bloud of a calfe, and a goat prayed for the
people, that their sins might be forgiuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, x which
he confessed before God, laying his hand vpon the
head of a quick goat, &amp; afterward he caused it to bee
carried away into the wildernes, wherby he would
signifie that al their sins were forgiuen them. Then
attiring himself in his rich ornaments (for when he
went into the holiest place, hee wore no other then
the ordinarie Priests did weare when they offered
sacrifice) he offred at the common Altar a great sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and this feast was alwaies vpon the 10. of the
7. month, but it began vpon the 9. day at night, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
also al the people bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> their fasting, which they did
continue all the next daye, this fast began so soone
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19856:93"/>
in respect of the solemnitie thereof, as far excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all other fasts, of which they had in euery of
the twelue moneths some, beside their ordinarie
feasts euery weeke, which were vpon the second &amp;
fift of their sabaoth, that is to say, vpon munday and
Thursday.</p>
            <p>Vpon the fifteenth of the same moneth they did
celebrate the feast of the Tabernacles, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
that they dwelled in Tabernacles, at theyr
return from Egypt, this feast continued 7. dayes, of
which the first onely was holy from work, and not
the last, because the next day after the last of the
feast, they did celebrate another holyday, which
they caled the Meeting for a special worship of god,
&amp; thanksgiuing vnto him for his benefits, on which
it was not lawfull for them to do any worke (except
such as was necessarie for their foode) and two such
dayes they would not haue together, because it
seemed inconuenient for the poore, who got their
liuing by their handie labour, by which custome it
appeareth, that the opinion of those was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
who thought that the first day of the feast
of vnleuened bread was neuer kept vppon Friday,
but when it so fell, it was put off vnto the sabaoth,
lest two dayes should come together, in which the
people might not worke, and that accordingly, the
eating of the Lambe was transferred a day longer
for that yeere, which whether it were lawfull or
no, it is a verie great difficultie to define, but
not materiall in this place, whether it were so or
no, because in some things they would do often as
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19856:93"/>
themselues listed, but the like feast as that was of
their meeting, was also celebrated vpon the last day
of their feast of vnleauened bread, which nowe in
this feast of the Tabernacles they could not so well
doe, because that the solemnitie of this feast of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,
consisted in dwelling abroade in taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,
where they could not conueniently meete,
for euerie houshold set vp a tabernacle, not so large
as they would, but to serue their own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>panie, they
set them vp in such order as tabernacles are nowe
vsed, the couering was of linnen, &amp; perchance some
skins ouer the linnen, to keepe out the weather, and
the poorer sort, who were not able to make such
prouision, made their Tabernacles with bowes.
Great sacrifice was offred in this feast of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,
&amp; all the time of the feast the people carried
in their hands bows of mirtle, willowes, citron, and
palm-tree, with their fruit hanging on them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they would shew, how that they were brought
out of a barren desart into a verie fruitfull country,
where was great plentie of all things, this feast they
called the feast of Scenopegia, to signifie that they
dwelled for this time in Tabernacles, not that they
might not goe forth at their pleasure, but because
there was their principall abode for that time.</p>
            <p>At this feast was their seuenth yeere alwayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
which they accounted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> seuenth to seuenth,
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> their time of their entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce into Palestina. In eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
7. yeere, they did neither sow, nor set, nor gather
any thing as their own in particular, but al the fruits
which the earth of it self did yeeld, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon for
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19856:94"/>
as well Gentiles as Iewes, and for this cause God
gaue them treble increase of all things in the sixth
yeere, also all those Iewes which were sold to any
Iew, were in this yeere sette at libertie, and no debt
dew to a Iew, by a Iew could bee demaunded, and
yet they were forbidden to withdraw theyr loane
from their poore neighbours. when this yeere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached.
In this yeere the Booke of the lawe was
read vnto the people, and this was the solemnity
of the seuenth yeere.</p>
            <p>After the same manner they did account euery
fiftie yeere, which they did proclaim in the seuenth
moneth of the 49 yeere, with sound of Trumpet
to bee a yeere of Iubile, that is, a yeere of remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for in that yeere all slaues were set at libertie,
and such Iewes as would not part from their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in the seuenth yeere, either because they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him or else (if perchance the slaues had marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his seruice a woman, who was no Iewe, and
therefore not to bee set at libertie before) because
they would not forsake their wiues and children,
which during that time they had by them, and in
this case a slaue was brought vnto the priests, and
being set against the post of the doore his care was
bored through with an All, and then he could not
goe from his maister vntill the yeere of Iubile,
but in the yeere of Iubilie, hee and his wife
and children were al free. Also in this yeere of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,
al the possessions which were sold, returned to
their first owner, lest in time should grow a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
among the tribes, which were distinguished
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19856:94"/>
by the partition of the land, but with this caution,
that if the buyer had layde out more then was
the commoditie hee hadde by it, hee that solde it
should giue him satisfaction for it, but if any house
(except the Leuits house) in a Citie were solde<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> it
could neuer bee redeemed againe, if it were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
within a yeere after it was solde, which
was to make the people haue care of the Cittie
wherein they dwelled, seeing their houses were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a yeere to passe cleane from them. All loanes or
lettinges of moueable goodes were ordered euerie
seauenth yeare. The trumpets which they vsed in
this yeare of Iubilie, were not of siluer as those were
with which they called the people to the temple,
nor such as they vsed in the feast of their trumpetes
the first day of their seauenth month, for these were
of Rams hornes, but were of hotns of greater bests,
as Buffelars and were made of that fashion that the
brasen trumpets were made.</p>
            <p>The fourth solemnitie of the seauenth moneth
was in remembrance of the finding holy fire, which
was hid by <hi>Ieremie</hi> the Prophet, when the Iewes
were carried prisoners into <hi>Babilon,</hi> and their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
destroyed, and it was found at their return again
which when it was brought forth, it appeared to be
nothing but a congealed water, but when it was laid
vpon the sacrifice, and the sunne did shine vpon it, it
flamed vp and consumed the sacrifice, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so long as anie sacrifice continued in the temple,
for from the first time that the Iewes had this fire
(which came miraculously from heauen, when <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:19856:95"/>
offered as high priest first sacrifice, it was neuer
extinguished, but night and day it was maintained
by the priestes.</p>
            <p>In the 9. month they kept their Encoenia which
was in remembrance of the renouation of their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by <hi>Iudas</hi> the Machabee, after the Gentiles had
prophaned it, this feast continued eight dayes, and
in their 12. moneth they had a holyday in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of an ouerthrow which <hi>Iudas</hi> gaue vnto <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canor,</hi>

the Iewes, and in the same moneth they solemnized
those dayes which being granted by <hi>Asseuerus</hi> (who
ruled 55. yeares from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Ethiopia</hi> 127. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces)
to <hi>Aman</hi> for the massacre of all the Iewes

               </gap>ll the
male kind were to shew themselues at the temple
by their law, to wit at the feastes of their Phase, their
Pentecost, and their Scenopegia, but male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
who could come were to appeare at their
Phase, because they were all bound to offer or eate
of a lambe or a kid offered at that time, and it was
not lawfull for them to offer it but in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
for this cause did the maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> mother &amp; <hi>Ioseph</hi> repaire
vnto the temple euery yeare at this feast, &amp; carried
the young prince with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, who passed to &amp; fro the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19856:95"/>
more securely, because no shew mas made of any
such personage, yet did he once aboue al other times
draw all to marke him, &amp; giue them some cause to
admire him. The virgin carried him (as she was
wont) vnto the temple, where were so many glad of
his company that presuming once that some of her
kinsfolke had gotten him amongst them, she &amp; her
spouse departed from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> without him, but
when at night they found him not amongst their
kinsfolke, the virgins griefe was so great as it cannot
be shewed, although returning vnto <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
not finding him so soon as she would, it was encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
but before she left seeking him, she found him
in the temple sitting among the Doctors, hearing
their discourses, and demanding of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> some que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
for such was the custome among the Iewes
that it was not onely lawful, but well accepted by
al, that any of what years or condition soeuer might
reason with the learnedest Doctors, who for that
cause sate in their chayres at the entrance of the Iews
court, &amp; other places were prepared for others, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one according to their reputation, and mats on
the ground for the yonger sort to sit, &amp; heare what
was taught by the Doctors, and it was as lawfull for
them as any in these conferences to demaund of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and vsuall to declare their owne mindes, but
so soon as she saw him, she went vnto him, and full
of ioy, and reuerence she said, Sonne why hast thou
thus done vnto vs, thy Father (for so was <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
reputed in the worlde,) and I haue sought
thee with no little griefe, but hee replyed
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19856:96"/>
againe vnto her, demaunding why they sought for
him, taking no exceptions against that word Father,
because it was in a publike assembly, yet because hee
would giue them somewhat to mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e vpon, headded
vnto his former speech, knew yee not that I was to
be aboute my Fathers businesse, by which the sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by might easily perceiue that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was not his
Father, both for that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was present, and that
kind of busines about which he was imploied, could
not belong to <hi>Ioseph:</hi> after which aunswere made
vnto them, they were somewhat amased, but the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
let neither word nor deede slippe her without a
deepe meditation, conferring euery thing together
which she heard him speake or see him do, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he returned to <hi>Nazareth</hi> with them, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vnder them in most dutifull manner, as who
had before all worldes knowne what belonged to a
sonne, profiting euery day in wisedome and grace,
both in the sight of God and men, which profit was
not absolutely in either, for hee had all wisedome
essentiall vnto him being the eternall wisedome of
his Father, but he profited in that he practised what
before he knew, and ioyned to his speculatiue wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
a wisedome gotten by experience, and so
likewise is hee saide to profite in grace, not that
hee was not from the very instant of his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
replenished with all grace, by reason of that
heauenly vnion which then was made, but that as
a man he encreased it by other kind of actions, then
he practised before he was a man, which what they
were more then his subiection to his mother, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19856:96"/>
to the poore Carpenter his supposed father are not
in any credible historie recorded, except what hee
did after he was thirty yeares of age, and so forward
vntill his returne from whence he first came.</p>
            <p>But concerning the spending of his youth, some
affirme that he vsed the Carpenters art, which hee
seemed to haue learned of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> because an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
truth hath reuealed, that men of that place
where he dwelled, &amp; such as in such a matter could
not be deceiued, after they heard him what he said,
and saw what he did (when he shewed himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world) maruelled whence he should haue so
great power, and so much knowledge, one of them
putting another in mind that he was the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who was <hi>Maries</hi> sonne, and whose kinsfolke
dwelled among them.</p>
            <p>But how can it be that the virgine should bee an
inheretrix, aud to no small reuenewes, and yet bee
forced to liue vpon her sonnes labour? (for <hi>Ioseph</hi>
liued not many yeares after his returne from <hi>Egipt)</hi>
it seemeth a very inconuenient thing, that without
any necessitie either she should giue from her selfe
all that she had, or he be subiect both to euill words
and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>rse vsage. To this some do easily make this
answere, that the virgine enioyed what her parents
had before, although after her sonne shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
vnto the world, both he and she forced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to liue vppon the charitie of others, lest in
counselling others to sell all which they had, and
giue it to the poore if they would follow him, hee
might iustly haue beene challenged for preaching
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19856:97"/>
one thing, and practising another: wherefore the
yong prince vsed an arte, onely because he would
not seeme to the world to liue idely, for that was so
scandalous a thing in that country, that the chiefest
men did train vp their children in one kind of trade
or other, but the young prince although hee could
haue vsed what arte hee would, being skilfull in all
by his extraordinarie knowledge, as well of the
least matters as the greatest, yet hee chose to bee
a Carpenter rather then any other artificer: first,
because he was not yet to shew himselfe vnto the
world, and therefore would do nothing but what
people might thinke he was taught by <hi>Ioseph,</hi> whom
they tooke to bee his father. Secondly, for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
he did beare vnto that arte aboue all other,
hauing vsed it from the first framing of the world, a
worke so much more excellent then euer any other
Carpenter could make, by how much the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by which it was made is incomparablie bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then any Carpenters tooles. Thirdly, because
it was the custome among the prophetes, which
were sent vnto the Iewes, to shew before they did
prophesie by some action what was the effect of
their message: and he would do the like.</p>
            <p>The Prophete <hi>Ose</hi> being to foretell the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the house of <hi>Iehn,</hi> who was king of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
and also how Israel (that is the ten Tribes
which diuided themselues from <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min)</hi>
was forsaken of God for their sinne, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
customes, he tooke a wife which was before
an harlot, by which hee would signifie vnto the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19856:97"/>
people, that they liued in fornication and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of filth, although because he married her he
committed no sinne, and when hee had gotten
by her a sonne hee called his name <hi>Iesrael,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee would signifie that the blood which was
shed in <hi>Iesrael</hi> should bee reuenged vpon <hi>Iehu,</hi> for
although <hi>Iehu</hi> pleased God well in ouerthrowing
the house of <hi>Achab</hi> and <hi>Iezabell,</hi> and therefore was
rewarded with the kingdome of Israel, and his
posteritie vnto the fourth generation: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was not free from those vices of <hi>Ieroboam</hi>
the first king of the Israelites: which diuided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from the rest. <hi>Zachar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>as</hi> who was the fourth
from him was slaine, and the kingdome possessed
by <hi>Sellum,</hi> who was of another stocke. And after
the prophet had this sonne by his wife, he had also
a daughter, which hee called without mercie,
because God would haue no mercie vpon Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el:
then he had also by her another sonne, whom
hee named, <hi>Not my people,</hi> whereby hee would
shewe vnto them how that God had altogether
forsaken them. So that three yeares or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
at the least were past before hee ended
his prophesie, which without this action hee
might haue ended in fewe more then three
wordes.</p>
            <p>In the same manner <hi>Ezechiel</hi> the prophet (when
hee was in <hi>Babilon)</hi> carried out of his house
all his substance by day, in the sight of the
Iewes, who were captiues there at the same time,
and by night hee digged a hole in the wall of his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19856:98"/>
house, through which he crept, and when hee was
out he was taken vp, and caried away, by which he
would shew vnto the Iewes which see this strange
deuise, how <hi>Hierusalem</hi> should be spoiled, and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechias</hi>
the king carried away captiue, as afterward
it proued, although by night hee had thought to
saue himselfe by flight through a priuate gate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ieremie</hi> also the Prophet after he had tried in vaine
to stay the reliques of the people in <hi>Palestina,</hi> who
hastened into <hi>Egipt</hi> for feare that <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi>
would reuenge vpon them the death of <hi>Godolias,</hi>
(who was left by him as president of the countrie
and slaine by the Iewes) when he came into <hi>Egipt</hi>
(for thither the Iewes carried him against his will)
he laid a great heape of stones in a caue which was
vnder a bricke wal at <hi>Pharao</hi> his court gate, and then
he said vnto them, that <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> who was
king of <hi>Babilon</hi> should place his throne vpon these
stones, and when hee should strike <hi>Egipt</hi> they also
should perish with the Egiptians.</p>
            <p>Many other things are recorded, which both this
and other prophets did before they vttered their
message, but these suffice to shew their names of
prophesying, and the young prince perchance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would obserue the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> course being the
chiefest of all prophetes, busied himselfe in such
things before he preached, as might very fitly bee
applyed to his purpose: for as some men do say, he
wrought nothing but yoakes and ploughes. Hee
made yoakes to shew that the perfection of his law
consisted in mutuall loue: and because in a yoake
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19856:98"/>
are as it were two parts in one, wee should studie
for nothing else but the true loue of God, and our
neighbour, and this not so much for any our own
interest or our neighbours, as purely and onely for
God, in which yoake whosoeuer draweth, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
first, and then tryeth how sweete it is, for hee
which made this yoake, sayde also, my yoake is
sweete, and my burden light. He made ploughes, to
shew that men must perseuere in that good woorke
they beganne, or else all the former gaine is to little
purpose, because he which holdeth the plough,
and looketh backward, is not iudged fitte for the
kingdome of God, as also hee afterward preached,
which sentences may haue a more fit place hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to bee discussed, lette it nowe suffice, that they
shew howe that the young prince did not in vaine
spend his time in making yoakes and ploughes,
whose principall arrant was for nothing else, but
that his spouse taking on her his yoake, and going stil
forward fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vertue to vertue, might recouer with a
sweet pain, what she carelesly lost by a proude sin.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Palestina</hi> labored all this while vnder a most
grieuous yoake, &amp; so much the more grieuous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had no hope of any help. The 72. seniors
who were alwaies of the familie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the
chiefe princes of the people, &amp; therfore could beare
great sway among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, were al murdered by <hi>Herod,</hi>
for he could neuer brooke any of the ancient nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and Proselithes, as himselfe was, were in their
place. The two brethren whose falling out for the
Kingdome, was <hi>Herods</hi> falling into it, were

by <hi>Pompey,</hi> afterwarde <hi>Hircanus,</hi> in whome
was all the right which was knowne, both to the

by <hi>Herod, Alexander,</hi> eldest sonne to <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> and

hee bestowed one of them vppon a great Lorde

taken, and after some grieuous torture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
by <hi>Antony. Alexandra</hi> daughter to <hi>Hireanus,
Herod</hi> did put to death, and her daughter <hi>Mariam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
who was his owne wife, also his own sonnes
<hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> whome hee had by her,
but before those hee caused <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> who was
brother to <hi>Mariamnes,</hi> to bee drowned, for he was
the onely man whome at that time hee feared, as
well for his towardlinesse, as his title hee hadde to
the kingdome. Yet to colour his malice, hee gaue
him all the honour which hee could, he displaced
<hi>Ananelus,</hi> whome before hee had exalted vnto the
priesthood, and restored <hi>Aristobulus</hi> to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priesthood,
by which fact, all that stocke thought
themselues bound to him: he might at his pleasure
make him away when he would, for before, <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dra</hi>
had procured <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the Queene of Egypt,
to make <hi>Antony</hi> the Emperour send for him, fearing
lest that at one time or other, hee should be murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

by <hi>Herod:</hi> but when that <hi>Herod</hi> perceiued that
some did worke to get him out of his handes, after
the first excuse made to <hi>Antony,</hi> that the people
would not like well to haue their onely hope from
them in a strange countrey: by this exalting him
hee contented them all, and <hi>Alexandra</hi> ioyed so
much to see her sonne made high priest, as shee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
that euer shee had any iust cause to thinke him
in any perill. <hi>Herod</hi> seeing all things to goe forward
as hee would wish, and that nowe hee was trusted
with the youth, for hee was not past sixteene or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteene
yeeres of age, which was vsed for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
that he was not before placed in that dignity,
he practised the more securely what he intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Aristobulus,</hi> but as it is thought, hee made the
more haste, because he saw an extraordinary ioy in
all the people, who were maruailously affected
vnto the youth, for that in all his actions, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at the Altar in his rich ornaments, hee did most
liuely represent vnto them his grandfather <hi>Aristobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
performed all things with exceeding great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
and reuerence. <hi>Herod</hi> resolued to rid him and
his owne feare, playd with him as he was woont to
doe (for he cared not sometime if hee were seene to
vse some youthfull games in his companie, to
make him and others thinke how much hee loued
him) and when they were both somewhat hote,
vnder pretence of some refreshing, hee carryed
<hi>Aristobulus</hi> to a verie pleasant place, where were
large pondes, and men swimming in them, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19856:100"/>
whome (at <hi>Herods</hi> verie importunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie)
<hi>Aristobulus</hi> went also to swimme, and the
swimmers hauing gotten him into the water, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make him some sport, but <hi>Herod,</hi> (who
was a looker on) had all the pleasure, for they diued
so long, and so often, and ducked him with them
so much, that in the end striuing to small purpose,
hee was drowned by them. Then was nothing
heard in the country, but weeping and lamenting,
and <hi>Herod</hi> himselfe, although hee wept at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
was thought afterwarde to grieue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
when hee reflected vpon those commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parts, which were in the youth, and hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
this fact, when <hi>Antony</hi> by <hi>Cleopatra</hi> her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement,
at <hi>Alexandra</hi> her suite, sent for him to
answere for it, but before hee went to make his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
hee sent such effectually pleading presents,
as when hee came, all which he swore and forswore
was beleeued, and contrary to the expectation of
the whole world and his own, was not only acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of this cruell murder, but also vsed in most
friendly and familiar manner. The children which
<hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus, Herods</hi> sonnes by <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amnes</hi>
left behinde them, were too yong at this time
to lay clayme to the kingdome, although afterward
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> who was sonne to <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Archelaus</hi> shewing himselfe to be <hi>Herods</hi> son
in all things which might vexe the Iews, brought
them all into such humours, as they cared not what
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19856:100"/>
King they had, so that they might bee freed from
<hi>Herods</hi> kinred, and some of them without anye
head, opposed themselues at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> agaynst
the Romanes, as the cheefest authours of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
others seeing no possibilitie of withstanding
the Romanes, who were now become conquerours
of all the worlde, made suite at <hi>Rome</hi> to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Augustus,</hi> that they might bee altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Romanes gouernement. Some followed
one named <hi>Iudas,</hi> whose father <hi>Ezechias</hi> had in
<hi>Herods</hi> time troubled the whole countrey, and they
were the more encouraged to accept him for their
King, because at <hi>Sephoris,</hi> the cheefest Citie of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile,</hi>
hee tooke the Storehouse, wherein was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
much armour, with the which hee armed
those who followed him. Others about <hi>Hierico,</hi>
were contented to honour one named <hi>Simon</hi>
with the title of a Kinge, hee had serued <hi>Herod</hi>
in his life time, and nowe perswaded himselfe
that hee had as much right vnto the kingdome,
as <hi>Herod</hi> his maister had before him: whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
to shewe some forwardenesse, hee burned
and spoyled many Pallaces therabout, and gaue
what was to bee gotten, among his souldiours.
But these factions continued not so longe, as
that which a shephearde beganne of a huge sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and strengthe, his name was <hi>Athronges,</hi>
hee had foure bretheren, not much inferiour
to himselfe, whome hee made gouernours of those
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19856:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
multitudes which flocked vnto him, but in the end
some of the brethren being taken, the other vpon
condition yeelded vnto <hi>Archelaus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others hearing a rumor, that <hi>Alexander</hi> one of
<hi>Herods</hi> sonnes, whom he had by <hi>Mariamnes,</hi> was
yet liuing, beleeued it, because they much wished
it, and no honour due vnto a King, was thought
too much for him, hee was brought to Rome in
most princely manner, with hope to haue this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Palestina,</hi> and to requite all those, who had
in this sort maintained him.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Caesar,</hi> who knew that <hi>Herod</hi> was too carefull
to lette any of them escape death, who he resolued
should die, especially such as whose kind he feared,
would not beleeue that any such report could bee
true, yet hearing that many thousands of people
would not onely say it, but sweare it, hee beganne
somewhat to doubt, and sent <hi>Celadus,</hi> who hadde
beene a companion with <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Aristobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
while they liued at <hi>Rome,</hi> to see what this should
meane, and whether it were <hi>Alexander</hi> or some
counterfeit, but both his countenance and his skill
in all matters concerning <hi>Palestina</hi> was such as <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
returned answere, that it could bee no other

the casualtie of the seas, hazard all their hope in

one voyage, but before hee had long talked with

(which was not possible to bee in <hi>Alexander,</hi> who
in all poynts, as well in behauiour as countenance,
shewed himselfe a maruailous braue and towardly

counterfeit, and not <hi>Alexander Herods</hi> sonne: beside
that, hee felt his hande verie hard and rough, more
like vnto some peasants hand of the countrey, then
the hand of a prince. Wherefore in some earnest
manner, but with fayre speeches, he commanded
him to shew truely who hee was, and who had put
this attempt into his head, and promised him his
pardon. <hi>Alexander</hi> not hauing nowe his tutor at his

laughed, <hi>Alexander</hi> was sent to the gallyes, and his
tutor put to death, by which meanes all wente still
currant with <hi>Archelaus,</hi> who presuming much
vpon the Emperour his fauour, hid nothing of his
owne disposition, but ruled where hee had authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with so much tyrannie, as both the Iewes and
Samaritanes ioyned together (who were euer dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

both Gods law, and allyance with the other parte
of <hi>Palestina,</hi> and sacrificed both to whom, &amp; where
<hi>Antiochus</hi> would haue them, and sent an Embassage
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19856:102"/>
to <hi>Rome</hi> vnto the Emperour, where they touched

all that was his, adding that part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye
(ouer which before <hi>Archelaus</hi> was tetrarch)
vnto <hi>Siria,</hi> and sent one from <hi>Rome</hi> to gouerne it.</p>
            <p>Thus came <hi>Hierusalem</hi> the cheefest Citie of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestina,</hi>
vnder the gouernement of the Romanes,
who although they often attempted as <hi>Herod</hi> had
before them, to prophane the temple, yet at theyr
times euery thing was performed in the temple,
which was accustomed to bee doone before. The
Romanes saw that <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> made it no
matter of religion to change the high priest so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as they listed, and that libertie also they vsed,
contrary to the custome which was alwayes obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
among the Iewes, for while one high priest
once chosen was liuing, no one did the office of
the high-priesthood but hee, except vpon some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
hee were not fitte for it, as once it chaunced,
that the high priest dreaming that hee lay with his
wife the night before hee was to offer a solemne
sacrifice, was accounted vncleane for that which
passed from him in his sleepe, at which time ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for that daye supplyed his place, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

               </gap>nctions in the Temple. <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> was
the first that did substitute one in the high priestes
roome while the other liued. <hi>Aristobulus</hi> forced his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19856:102"/>
brother <hi>Hircanus</hi> to leaue both the kingdome and
priesthood to him, &amp; the third time that the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest
was changed, was whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> 
               <hi>Herod</hi> placed or displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>Ananelus,</hi> for <hi>Aristob,</hi> his wiues brother, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
it became a verie ordinarie matter, which
both <hi>Herod, Archelaus,</hi> &amp; the Romanes did the more
boldly, because in the time of their gouernment,
they had the keeping of the high priests rich orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts,

Pallace, which afterward hee made a verie strong
Castle, and called it after the name of his friend <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi>
who was his chiefest stay during his life. This
pallace did belong to the Machabees, and <hi>Hircanus</hi>

thought it good pollicie to haue them still in his
own keeping, and thereby in some sort to be able to
bridle the Iewes. <hi>Archelaus</hi> succeeded his father, and
kept them in the same manner, and when hee was
banished, the Romanes entred vpon the Castle, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19856:103"/>
all things which they founde there: yet to content
the Iewes, the president kept a lampe continually
burning before them, which was accounted a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
keeping of these holy ornaments, &amp; deliuered
them seuen dayes before they were to bee vsed,
that they might bee purified before the feast, for
they were accounted as prophaned by lying in a
prophane house, or by passing through prophane
handes, but the next day after they were vsed, they
were brought backe to the president, and locked vp
vntill they were to bee vsed againe, which was but
thrice ordinarily in the yeere.</p>
