            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE ſincere deſire which the King hath had to maintain the Truce concluded in the Year 1684. induced His Majeſty to diſſemble the Conduct of the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> in the Courts of all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> where they laboured nothing more than to excite them to take up Arms againſt <hi>France.</hi> His Majeſty was not ignorant, how far they were concerned in the Negotiation of the League of <hi>Ausbourg</hi>; and was likewiſe informed of the part the Governor of the Spaniſh <hi>Low-Countries</hi> had, in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize againſt <hi>England</hi>; but not being able to believe, that he acted therein by the Order of the King his Maſter, who was obliged by ſo many Reaſons of Religion, of Blood, and the Safety of all Kings, to oppoſe ſuch an Uſurpation, His Majeſty had hoped, He ſhould have been able to induce the <hi>Catholick King</hi> to joyn with him for the Re-eſtabliſhment of the lawful King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Preſervation of the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> againſt the Union of the <hi>Proteſtant Princes</hi>; or at leaſt, if the ſtate of Affairs in <hi>Spain</hi> did not permit his Catholick Majeſty to enter into the like Engagements, to obſerve an exact Neutrality; to which end, His Majeſty hath, ſince the Month of <hi>November</hi> laſt paſt, cauſed ſeveral Propoſals to be made to him, which were well received, whilſt the Succeſs of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Enterprize ſeemed doubtful, but theſe favourable Diſpoſitions diſappeared ſo ſoon as it was known at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that the King of <hi>England</hi> had left his Kingdom, and nothing was then there talk'd of but a War againſt <hi>France.</hi> His Majeſty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood at the ſame time, that the Spaniſh Ambaſſador was daily with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and ſollicited him to have the Engliſh declare War againſt <hi>France:</hi> That the Governor of the Spaniſh <hi>Low-Countries</hi> raiſed Troops with great diligence; that he promiſed the States-General to joyn them with their Forces at the beginning of the Campagne, and ſollicited them, as well as the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to ſend Forces to <hi>Flanders,</hi> in order to put thoſe Countries into a poſture to make War upon <hi>France.</hi> All theſe Advices made His Majeſty think, he ought in prudence to know, what he was to depend upon. He therefore gave Order to the Marquis <hi>de Rebenac,</hi> his Ambaſſador at <hi>Madrid,</hi> to demand of the Miniſters of the Catholick King a poſitive Anſwer, offering him the Continuance of the Truce, upon condition, He would oblige himſelf to obſerve an exact Neutrality, and not to aſſiſt directly or indirectly His Majeſty's Enemies; but the Evil Councils having prevailed, His Majeſty was informed, That the Reſolution was taken, to favour the Uſurper of <hi>England,</hi> and to joyn with the Proteſtant Princes. His Majeſty underſtood likewiſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the ſame time, That the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Agents had received conſiderable Sums of Money at <hi>Cadiz</hi> and <hi>Madrid</hi>; that the Troops of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> were entred into the Principal Places of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi>; and that the Governor of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> did ſollicite the States-General to cauſe their Forces to advance to <hi>Bruſſels:</hi> All theſe Advices added to the Anſwer, which the Marquis <hi>de Rebenac</hi> received at <hi>Madrid,</hi> leaving His Majeſty no room to doubt, That the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Catholick King is to joyn with his Enemies; His Majeſty hath thought, He ought to loſe no time to prevent his Evil Deſigns; and hath reſolved to declare War againſt him, as well by Sea as Land, as He doth by theſe Preſents. His Majeſty, for this effect, Commands and Enjoyns all His Subjects, Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals and Servants, to fall upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and hath expreſly forbidden, and doth forbid, their having henceforward any Communication, Commerce or Intelligence with them, upon pain of Death. And to this end, His Majeſty does revoke all Permiſſions, Paſſports, Safe-guards, and Safe-conducts, that may have been granted by himſelf, or his Lieutenant-Generals, and other his Officers, contrary to theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and hath declared, and does declare them to be Null, and of no effect and force, forbidding all perſons whatſoever to have any regard thereunto. His Majeſty Orders and Commands the Lord-Admiral, Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> Governors and Lieutenant-Generals for His Majeſty in his Provinces and Armies, Mareſchals <hi>de Camp,</hi> Colonels, Captains and Commanders of his Forces, as well Horſe as Foot French and Foreigners, and all other his Officers to whom it ſhall appertain, to cauſe the Conten<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to be put in Execution within the Extent of their reſpective Powers and Juriſdictions: For ſuch is His Majeſty's Pleaſure. He Wills alſo, and Enjoyns, That theſe Preſents be Publiſhed and affixed in all the Towns, as well Maritime as others, and in all the Ports, Harbors, and other Places of his Kingdom and the Territories under his Obedience, where it ſhall be needful; to the end, none may pretend cauſe of Ignorance.</p>
