            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HOwſoever Men fall into the Miſery of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deluded by Errors, nothing appears Amiable under that Name; and whatſoever carries the name of Reformation, is therefore thought Honourable and Glorious, becauſe it profeſſes to caſt out thoſe. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves applaud a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and will therefore own Ours to be no other then Pretended; and plead that their Religion is Actually a Reformation, that they may more confidently urge the Unneceſſarineſs of another. But we cannot be ignorant how the Name has been abuſed, and Experience has ſhew'd us what Reformation They have made in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of our Saviour; what Truths they have expunged, how they have perverted and depraved, and indeed made it quite another Goſpel then what was at firſt delivered: They have Reformed it, only to make it ſerve their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and elevate their God, both which it ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and condemns. As this raiſed a Generous Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and an Heroick Zeal in thoſe whom God had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to diſcover and overthrow their Abuſes, ſo it made them ſee the high Neceſſity of another Reformation, and to endeavour it with that Succeſs which the Proteſtant World juſtly admires and bleſſes God for at this day.
<pb facs="tcp:97749:3"/>
Our Fathers have to their Honour and Praiſe taken care to inſtil the Principles and the Love of a true Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into their Poſterity, and it has been ſo ſtrong as to increaſe with freſh vigour and more largely to diffuſe it ſelf in our times. But how many are there even among our ſelves, who owe their Religion to little elſe then their Education, and cry up ſtill loudly for the Reformation, without being able to give ſolid Reaſons and Grounds of their Profeſſion? They have ſuck'd it in with their Milk, and as they took it up without their own foreſight, ſo they have thought it needleſs to take a view of the Juſtice and the Reaſons of it, if they did but profeſs themſelves Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. The moſt have a Zeal, but not according to Knowledge, which were highly commendable if it were joyned with it. Indeed, if we take a view of all who unite under the Name of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the divers Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who have little elſe common between them, we muſt ſadly acknowleged our ſelves like the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> who when they had made an Inſurrection in the City, and for two hours ſpace cried up their <hi>Diana,</hi> yet 'tis hard to define which excelled, their Zeal or their Ignorance, when a far greater part of them knew not ſo much as why they were come together. Therefore it is high time for us to be inſtructed in what we ſo much talk of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we may be ſenſible Reformation is ſomewhat more than a Pretence, and that our Adverſaries are not to be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as ſome Armies have been, by the great Noiſe and Clamour before the Engagement: No, there muſt be ſolid Argument, and well temper'd Truths, to aſſert our Religion; and our Reaſon, as well as our Faith, muſt be able to remove thoſe Mountains which the Deluge of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will be ſure to raiſe in our way; as ſome impute the Origine of Natural Hills to the Univerſal Flood, which cauſed even the <hi>Ararat</hi> on which the Ark reſted. There are <hi>Alps</hi> to be paſt, before we can enter <hi>Italy</hi> by way of Conqueſt; and if we would paſs
<pb facs="tcp:97749:3"/>
them, we have no other way to do it, but by cutting through them. Conſiderations like theſe, made me firſt Read, and conſequently admire this Author, whoſe cauſe was the ſame with ours, and he maintained it, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs, and I expected ſomething extraordinary of Courage and Conduct, from a man, who had ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf even in the Enemies Country, where he had no advantage but his Cauſe; the only Conqueſt he could pretend to, was, not to be overcome; and he could expect no aſſiſtance from men, but what our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf found, when he was aſſaulted with Swords and Staves, his Diſciples forſook him and fled. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe ſeeming Inconveniences and Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, they gave him only greater occaſions of ſetting forth his Makers Glory, and purchaſing his own; for though he came to them fairly in the Name of the Living God, and they Armed with Helmets of Braſs, and Spears like Weavers Beams; his ſmooth Stones taken out of that Current of Living Water, ſtrikes down the haughty <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites,</hi> and ſinks into their Foreheads, the certain Fate of all thoſe, who defy the Armies of the Living God. And we may gueſs at the compleatneſs of his Victory, by the Grandeur of his Triumph, for he put them to their laſt Reſerve, their Cenſure; they condemned what they could not Confute, and when their School-Divinity failed, the Flames (as I have heard) were called in to their aſſiſtance. This is the Infallible and Catholick Argument, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever oppoſeth the Popes Supremacy, muſt expect to feel that of the Faggot. And to ſhew that this way is antient enough, the <hi>Perſians</hi> by the ſame, proved the greatneſs and Univerſality of their Deities, becauſe it conſumed all the Images of the other Gods, till <hi>Canopus</hi> his Water Retorted the vain Sophiſtry upon them, and with a more powerful Pitcher, quenched their pretenſions and their <hi>Numen</hi> together. But Books have Souls as well as men, which ſurvive their Martyrdom, and are not burnt but
<pb facs="tcp:97749:4"/>
crowned by the Flames that encircle them. They quickly found that there was nothing Combuſtible in it, but the Paper; The Truth flew upward, like the Angel from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noahs</hi> Sacrifice, untoucht by the fire, and unſullied by the Smoak, and found a ſafe Refuge at the Footſtool of the God of Truth. And ſure whatſoever Received ſo ſevere a Doom from our Adverſaries, may challenge from us a kind Reception; They have taught us to value, what they thought not below their Malice, and it will be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Commendation amongſt Proteſtants, that the Papiſts knew it worth the Burning. This likewiſe may ſupply the place of a Panegyrick upon the Author, then whom none has done or ſuffered more in ſo glorious a Cauſe, and ſeeing we give ſo great a welcome to numbers of <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants that daily arrive amongſt us, let us receive Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> as one of them, and uſe him no better, nor any worſe then he deſerves. It is the Prerogative of a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to make him an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> to give him all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities our own Authors enjoy, and to make him equal in Liberty and Property with the beſt of our Native Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And indeed no man can wonder why he has now croſſed the Seas, and appears in this dreſs, with half the reaſon I do, that he appeared in it no ſooner; I have heard it has been the wiſh of ſome Great Divines, but their own Employments hindred them from Effecting it; and it might have been expected that it ſhould have moved ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body to have attempted it upon that very account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſired it. For ſince the Gift of Tongues is ceaſed, and thoſe Inſpired Linguiſts have been long ago ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced, Tranſlation is none of the worſt ways of ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that abſent Grace; neither can it be accounted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath any man by his Induſtry to retrieve a departed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. I could wiſh he had come forth in all the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Language, as he did at firſt in thoſe of his own: Thoſe Ceremonies of Speech, though in themſelves not abſolutely neceſſary, and add not much to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb facs="tcp:97749:4"/>
yet they contribute not a little to the Decency and pleaſing part of an Author; for there is a Delightful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ariſing from the Agreeable Mixture of the Colours of Language, without which a Book is never the leſs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, but with which it is much more perſwading. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he appears the more in his own Dimenſions, the thinner his Garments are, and the cloſer they ſit about him. I ſhall make no Apology for the Author, becauſe I know nothing in him that needs it, unleſs ſome ſhould miſtake ſome of his expreſſions about Epiſcopacy. Where if he has let fall any thing that may offend, he has theſe two things at leaſt for his excuſe: Firſt, that he lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an external conſtitution of a Church that did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe that way of Government: Secondly, he himſelf tells us, thoſe that he mentions were only ſuch who were of the Popiſh Communion, and only as ſuch he uſes them. I ſhall not detain the Reader any longer from the Book it ſelf, only I am to deſire him, that, whatſoever faults he finds in the Preface, may not be imputed any further to the Book it ſelf: For the more miſtakes there are in it, the more proper it is for that Perfect Piece it is ſet before; as the Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had no ſmall ſhare in the occaſion of our Religion, and may in ſome ſenſe be ſtiled, <hi>The Preface to the Reformation.</hi>

            <p>MY firſt thoughts after I had read the Books of the Prejudices, were, not to write any Anſwer to it: For beſides that I ſaw in that Book nothing elſe but the ſame Accuſations from which our Fathers and we have already been frequently juſtified; and that moreover they were wrote there in ſo extreamly paſſionate and invenom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a stile, for my own particular I did not think my ſelf bound to follow every where thoſe perſons who ſeem to make it their deſign to load me with the number of their Volumes, affecting to take me for a Party in all the Works that they daily publiſh, and even in thoſe that are moſt remote from the chief Subject of our Controverſy. Yet when I perceived the loud Out-cries that theſe Gentlemen and their followers made about their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, to draw the applauſe of the World to themſelves, as
<pb facs="tcp:97749:6"/>
if they had ſilenced us, and our Reformation remained over thrown under the weight of their Victory, I judged it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to enter upon this new labour, and the deference that I had for thoſe who exhorted me to undertake it, has brought forth this Treatiſe that I now give to the publick. Thoſe who ſhall take the pains to read it, will find that I have not meerly tied my ſelf to the Book that I confute, but that to ſave my ſelf the labour of doing it at twice, I have conſidered the matter in its firſt Principles, and examinëd it in its juſt extent, that I might be the better able to judge of it. I acknowledg the Subject Treated on required more Learning, readineſs, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then I was maſter of, but it may be alſo they will find in the plain and natural way wherein I have handled it, ſomething more eaſy, then if I had employed more Art and Meditation in it. It is this makes me hope, that when I ſhall not fully have anſwered the expectations of thoſe who have engaged me in this work, yet they will not read this Defence without ſome ſatiſfaction, However it be, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I take the boldneſs to preſent it to you, and to entreat the favour of you to receive it as a token of the acknowledgment that I have for ſo much goodneſs as you have teſtified towards me. I am perſwaded that thoſe of our Communion in this Kingdom will very heartily conſent, that my weak pen ſhould alſo expreſs the ſentiments that they all have of your perſon, and of the cares that you take to uphold their common intereſts. I will alſo affirm, that your Merit is ſo generally acknowledged, that when nothing ſhall be diſputed, but the just praiſes that are due to your prudence, to the wiſdom that appears through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your whole Conduct, to the inviolable Principles of Honour and Juſtice that are the perpetual Rules of your Actions, and in a word to the great and ſolid Vertues that you practiſe with ſuch exactneſs, they can aſſure themſelves that there will be no difference about that, between thoſe of the one and the other Communion. But all thoſe Qualities that they take notice of in You, how Rich and Reſplendent ſoever they are, even in the eyes of thoſe who are deſtitute of them, would be nothing elſe but
<pb facs="tcp:97749:6"/>
falſe dazling light, if they were not accompanied with real Piety, which only gives a value to all the Moral Virtues. You are not ignorant, <hi>My Lord,</hi> you, in whom we ſaw it but a few Months ago, how your Soul ready to take its flight, tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and remained confounded in the view of all that humane. Righteouſneſs, and that you could find no reſt in your Spirit, any where elſe, then in the boſom of Religion and Piety. This alone was that which gave you the Tranquillity of Soul, which taught all thoſe who had the honour to come near your Bed, after what manner a good man who could reſt aſſured of Gods Mercy, and the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, might look Death in the Face. It is this that has yet prolonged your days, or to ſpeak better, that has reſtored Life to you by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary bleſſing of heaven, little different from that which <hi>Hezechias</hi> heretofore received as the fruit of his humiliation and prayer.</p>
            <p>Continue, <hi>MY LORD,</hi> to lay out that life which has been given you again, in the ſervice of God, and in the employments to which your calling engages you, and of which you have ſo great an account to render. Thoſe employments are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult, and if I may take the boldneſs to ſay it, they are oppreſſing, through their quality, through their numbers, and through the accidents that either accompany or follow them. But he who has called you to them, will give you ability to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them, and will ſhed abroad his bleſſing upon your cares, as far as ſhall be neceſſary for his own glory and the good of the people, in whoſe favour you labour, and he himſelf will one day give you a reward for all thoſe toilſome Labours.</p>
            <p>Although you do not need to be excited to do good, yet I take the confidence to hope, that you will be ſome way encouraged in the Duties of your place, by the reading of this Work, which will more and more diſcover to you the Juſtice of it. You will ſee therein the Conduct of our Fathers justified, in regard of their Reformation and Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and by conſequence you will therein ſee not only the Right that we have, but the Obligation and indiſpenſable

Neceſſity alſo wherein we are, to live apart and divided from that Church, and united among our ſelves, in a Religious and Chriſtian Society, till it ſhall pleaſe God to make the Cauſes of that Diviſion ceaſe, and joyn again that which men, I would ſay what the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> and her <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> have put aſunder. That Re-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is a Happineſs that wee will alwayes beg of God with the moſt ardent Prayers, and which we will receive as one of his higheſt Favours, if his hand ſhould beſtow it. But it is alſo a thing which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to promiſe our ſelves: while we ſhall not ſee the ſame deſire of a good and holy Reformation (which was almoſt general in our Weſt in the daies of our Fathers) to be again revived in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which yet they knew how to ſtifle with incredible ſkill. An Authour of thoſe Times, who himſelf contributed as much as any other to clude the good effects of that deſire, has not failed to own it, and which is more, to own it to be juſt. <hi>I do not deny,</hi> ſaies he, <note place="margin">Caſſander Conſult. art. de Eccleſ.</note> 
               <hi>that many at the beginning were not urged by a motion of Piety, earneſtly to cry out againſt ſome manifeſt Abuſes, and I confeſs, that we muſt attribute the chief cauſe of that Diviſion that at preſent rends the Church, to thoſe who</hi> being <hi>puff'd up with a vain pride, under a pretence of Eccleſiaſtical power, contemned and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and diſdainfully rejected thoſe who admoniſh'd them with reaſon and modeſty.</hi> And imediately after that ſame Author reaſoning about the means to re-eſtabliſh a holy peace between the two parties; <hi>I do not believe,</hi> adds he, <hi>that we ought ever to hope for a firm peace in the Church, if thoſe who have been the cauſe of that dis-union do not begin by themſelves; that is to ſay, unleſſe thoſe who have the Eccleſiaſtical Government in their hands, relaxe a little of that great rigour, and contribute ſomething to the peace of the Church, and unleſſe in hearkning to the ardent prayers and exhortations of the greateſt part of good men, they apply themſelves to reform thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt abuſes, by the Rule of the holy Scriptures and of

It would oblige them, to ſtrip themſelves of that Soveraign and and abſolute Authority which they had Uſurped, and by which they had diſpoſed the Conſciences of men to their wills: And it would force them to give an Account of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97749:9"/>
that Publick management which they held in their hands, and no perſon is ignorant that, that is a thing of all others in the World moſt intolerable to thoſe perſons who have made a Secular Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Government of the Church. As thoſe Intereſts have made them lay hold of all they could to defend themſelves, ſo they have raiſed a new Controverſy, touching the Right that our Fathers had to reform themſelves. They demand of us who our Reformers were? from whence they came? and what Call they had for ſo Great a Work? They accuſe them to have been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Schiſmaticks, who lifted themſelves up againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Mother the Church, and broke the ſacred bond of the Chriſtian Communion. They have defamed their perſons as much as ever they could, and have laid to their charge the moſt wicked manners, to the end they might render them odious. In fine, they have put forward, all that they could believe capable, of retaining the people in a blind ſubmiſſion, and hindring them from entring upon any Examination of the Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>But, bleſſed be God, that notwithſtanding all the endeavours they have hither to made on a ſubject that has exhauſted all the ſubtilties of the Schools, the Juſtice of our Cauſe, which is the ſame with that of our Fathers, has not receiv'd the leaſt prejudice; and we can even aſſure our ſelves, that there has been nothing ſaid, the weakneſs and impertinency of which, may not eaſily be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd, to the bare light of common ſence.</p>
               <p>For, either thoſe things which our Fathers rejected, and which we reject with them, are in deed Errors, Superſtitions, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men, as we believe them to be, or they are not. If they are not, we will be the firſt that ſhall Condemn the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when they ſhall let us ſee that on the contrary they are the Truths, and right worſhip that belong to the Chriſtian Religion, we ſhall be very ready to receive them. But if in deed they are Errors and Corruptions, as we are perſwaded they are, with what Reaſon can any man demand by what right we rejected them, ſince it is all one as to demand what right we have to be good men, and to take care of our own Salvation? We may ſee then from thence, that all thoſe Evaſions, are nothing elſe but vain wranglings, and that we ought always to examine thoſe Tenets that are Controverted, for the Juſtice or Injuſtice of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation intirely depends on their Truth or Falſhood. If we have right at the Foundation, they ought not to raiſe a contention
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97749:9"/>
about the Form; for to be willing, to believe in God according to the purity of his word, and to be ready to ſerve him ſincerely, are the things to which we are all obliged, and which cannot be condemned, in whomſoever they are found, as on the contrary ſide, to harden one's ſelf in Errors, to practiſe a falſe Worſhip, and to expoſe one's ſelf to the danger of Damnation under pretence of obſerving ſome Formalities, is ſuch a guidance of one's courſe, as can never be Juſtified.</p>
               <p>It will here be to no purpoſe, that they ſay, that in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy concerning the Juſtice of the Reformation, they do not ſuppoſe that we have any reaſon in the Foundation of it; but that on the contrary, they have a mind to let us ſee that we have no right at all in the Foundation, ſince we have none at all in the Form; and that they would only ſay, that thoſe things, which we call Errors, and a falſe Worſhip, are not ſo indeed as we imagine them to be; ſince they are the Inſtitutions of a Church that can't Err, and to whoſe Authority we ought abſolutely to ſubmit our ſelves. This is, in my judgment, the courſe that not long ſince an Author has took, in a Book Intitled, <hi>Juſt Prejudices againſt the Calviniſts.</hi> For he pretends to conclude that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is faulty in the very Foundation, becauſe there are Errors in the manner of our Reformation, and that thoſe things which we reject as Errors, are the Truths that we ought to believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ought to acquieſce in the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that can never hinder us from coming to a diſcuſſion of the Foundation it ſelf, ſeparated from all Forms, and from all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices: for when theſe Gentlemen have reaſoned againſt us after this manner, You are faulty in the very Foundation, becauſe you have not had right in the Form; we oppoſe to that, this other Reaſoning, whoſe conſequence is not leſs Valid, as to the ſubject about which it is concerned, We have not done wrong in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becauſe we have right in the Foundation. And when they tell us, That which you call our Errors, Tranſubſtantiation, Adoration of the Hoſt, Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are not Errors, ſince we cannot Err, we Anſwer them, You can Err, becauſe the Tranſubſtantiation; the Adoration of the Hoſt, the Parga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that you teach, are Errors. And when they reply, You ought to believe that which we teach you, becauſe you ought to acquieſce and reſt in our Authority; we rejoyn again, We ought not to acquieſce in your Authority, becauſe you teach us thoſe things which we ought not to believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97749:10"/>
In theſe two ways of Reaſoning, it is certain that ours is the more equal, the more juſt, and more natural. For it is by far the more juſt and natural, that the Judgment of thoſe Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſhould depend on the higheſt Intereſt that can be in the World, which is that of the glory of God, and ourown Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then on the contrary, to make the glory of God, and our own Salvation, to depend upon ſome Formalities. It is far more reaſonable to judge of the Infallibility that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to by the things that ſhe teaches, then to judge of the chings that ſhe Teaches by a pretence of her Infallibility.</p>
               <p>But although theſe two ways were equally Natural, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reaſonable, they can not deny, that that which at firſt drew nearer to the Examen of the Foundation were not more ſure, and that all good men who ought to neglect nothing conducing to their Salvation, were not bound to enter into it, in Order to the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Errors. They Propoſe on one ſide for a Principle, the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt which there are a thouſand things to be ſaid; on the other ſide we Propoſe, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God himſelf ſpeaking in thoſe Scriptures, which all Chriſtians receive, and which the very Enemies of Chriſtianity reſpect; who will dare to deny that in this Oppoſition, it were not more ſure to ſide with that part, which rules all by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God? You may deceive your ſelves, ſay they, in taking that for the word of God, which is not ſo. And are not you, anſwer we, more liable to deceive your ſelves, in taking that for the Church of God, which is not ſo, and in taking thoſe for Infallible, who are no ways ſo? There is far greater Reaſon to hope that God will then aſſiſt you with the illumination of his Spirit, when with humility you ſearch out the ſence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which you are ſo often commanded to do, then when you ſearch them through humane prejudices, to ſubmit your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to a certain Orde of Men, whom God has never told you that they ought to be the Maſters of your Faith.</p>
               <p>After all, if they will make uſe of the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the pretended faults of our Reformation, as an Argument ſufficient to let us ſee that thoſe things which we call Errors are not really ſo, they can demand nothing more of us, then to ſet down this proof in its order with the reſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely to conſider it in its turn, before we determine our ſelves. But to pretend that that ought to hinder us from conſidering alſo the proofs on the contrary ſide, by which we may ſee that thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97749:10"/>
things that we call Errors are really ſo, this were an injuſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and bordering on [the greateſt] raſhneſs. For the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the pretended faults of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, whatſoever they be, are not Principles ſo demonſtrative and ſo evident among Chriſtians, that after them, they ought to hear nothing more. We ought then to yield to this proof, its place in our diſcuſſion, but without any prejudice as to thoſe that may be drawn for or againſt the very Tenets that are conteſted, which ought to be firſt examined, as the more natural and moſt deciſive. That being ſo, I hold, that that which they have ſet before us will be to no purpoſe at all. For if from the Examination that we ſhall make of thoſe matters in themſelves, it reſults, that thoſe things are not Errors which we have rejected as ſuch, but Chriſtian Truths, we have no further need either of the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the prejudices againſt the Reformation, The Reformation is ſufficiently overthrown. And if on the contrary, it reſults, that thoſe are Errors, all the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the prejudices in the World, ſhall not be able to perſwade men of good underſtandings that they are Truths, and by conſequence that the Reformation is not juſt, for it is always juſt to extirpate Errors.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to me, to appear already, that that debate which they have raiſed againſt us about the Juſtice of our Reformation, and our ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is rather a field wherein they would buſy themſelves in ſubtilties and declamations, to amuſe the People, then a juſt Controverſy whence one might juſtly expect any profit. Yet, as thoſe ſubtilties and declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how vain and falſe ſoever they are, fail not of finding applauſe in the World, and always making ſome impreſſions on the minds of men, we acknowledge the too great effect that they have produced, which is that the greateſt part of thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> look upon us as Schiſmaticks, and think that we have diſturbed the peace of the Family of God, and violated the right of that Religious Society which had united us with them. The <hi>Idea</hi> which they form of our Religion appears not half ſo odious to them. After what manner they have diſguiſed us, the moſt equitable among them diſcern, and fail not ſometimes freely to confeſs the ſame, that we have all Doctrines that are neceſſary to mens Salvation, that our Worſhip, as plain as it is, has nothing which does not tend to nouriſh in their hearts a true Piety and a ſolid Vertue, and that as to the Form of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97749:11"/>
it has nothing ſo remote, either from prudence, or from equity or from the Charity that Jeſus Chriſt has recommended to us. But it is a far different <hi>Idea</hi> which they Form within themſelves of our Separation, for it becomes inſupportable to them, when they compare it with the Specious name of a Church, that ought to command the Veneration of all Holy men. So that this is moſt ordinarily the matter of their reproaches, which they the more exaggerate as a thing about which they imagine we have not the leaſt ſhew wherewith to defend our ſelves; I dare affirm that as to the far greater part, that is the chiefeſt and almoſt the only matter, that makes them appear ſo much Exaſperated againſt us.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary then that we juſtify our ſelves, and that we clear to their minds that honour which we have, not only to live among them in the ſame civil Society, but alſo to depend on their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority in reſpect of thoſe humane affairs wherein we are engaged. Our own Innocence commands it of us; not to ſay that the inheritance which we have received from our Fathers is of a value ſufficiently great, to merit a defence, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſoever they attack it. We ought then to indeavour to let them ſee, that that which they are made to believe concerning us, is nothing but a falſe imputation, that we have an infinitly greater reſpect for the Church, then any of thoſe who oppoſe themſelves to hinder its Reformation; that their Maxims tend to the Ruin of the Church, where ours tend only to preſerve it; that our Separation from <hi>Rome</hi> is nothing elſe but an effect of that Love and Jealouſy that we have for the Church, and that it will be moſt unjuſt if they ſhall hate us upon an account, that ought on the contrary to draw from them all their eſteem and Love toward us.</p>
               <p>It is then about this, that we intreat that they would calmly hear us, and judge us without paſſion, and without intereſt, in the fear of that God, whom we all acknowledge for our Soveraign Judge. Thoſe who always act againſt us with a pride that hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them away, and who have reſolved to condemn us, and to the uttermoſt of their power to deſtroy us what ever we ſay, will not poſſibly take our requeſt to be juſt, and in that Caſe we ſhall content our ſelves as to them, with the Teſtimony of our Conſciences, which perſwades us not only that God will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us for having been Reformed, but alſo that he <hi>certainly</hi> will, if we do not in that follow the ſence of our hearts. But there
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97749:11"/>
are yet enough perſons in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of too much equity to follow the Examples of ſuch a ſort of People; theſe equitable perſons are thoſe of whom we demand that hearing, and that ſame equity, and moderation, of which they make ſuch profeſſion, and which the importance of the ſubject treated on, challenges them to yield us. We ſhall tell them nothing which ſhall not be founded, either on matters of fact known to all, or upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable principles of Religion, or upon the light of Common ſence.</p>
               <p>To ſet down this matter in ſome order, I propoſe to my ſelf to make evident theſe four Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our Fathers, had both right and obligation to examine the State of Religion, and the Latin Church, ſuch as it was in their days.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Reformation which they made was juſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in Reforming themſelves they had right, and were bound to ſeparate themſelves from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That in Reforming and Separating themſelves they had right, and obligation to maintain among themſelves a Chriſtian Society by publick Aſſemblies, and the exerciſe of the Miniſtry. I do not pretend that in Treating of theſe four Propoſitions I have exhauſted all my ſubject, but yet I hope that there will be few Queſtions that have ſome Relation to it, which I do not ſufficiently touch upon, and few Objections which I do not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anſwer. I will particularly anſwer to all thoſe that are contained in that Book of Prejudices, as the order of the matters that I Treat of, ſhall preſent them to me; none of which will begin to oppoſe themſelves till the ſeventh Chapter, becauſe that Author having paſſed by in ſilence a great many things that belong to the Foundation of this Controverſy, it will be neceſſary to touch upon them before we go any farther.</p>

                     <hi>That the State of the Government of the Latin Church ſome Ages ago, gave to our Fathers Prejudices, of its Corruption in Doctrine and Worſhip, ſufficient to drive them more nearly to Examine their Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS our Fathers did not Reform themſelves, but by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Examination which they made of Religion, ſuch as it was in their days, and as they did not enter upon that Examination but by the Prejudices which they received that its ſtate was extreamly corrupted, it is neceſſary to our judging of their Conduct, to conſider in the firſt place, of what nature and force thoſe Prejudices were, whether they were juſt, or unjuſt, raſh or reaſonable, and whether they juſtly led our Fathers to make a more particular Reflection upon that which they taught them. It ſhall be then by this Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Queſtion that we will begin, and firſt propoſe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices that the corrupted eſtate of the Eccleſiaſtical Government gave them ſome Ages before; and afterwards we ſhall conſider thoſe that the ſame External State of Religion furniſht them with.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this matter will engage us to declare thoſe Truths, which it may be will not be agreeable to all the World, they ought to remember that we are within the bounds of a juſt and natural defence, having been publickly provoked to it, by a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Book, which is alledged on all occaſions with great boaſting; and that that Book in aſſaulting us with Prejudices has furniſht us with the very ſame Example, to defend our Anceſtours likewiſe by Prejudices, and that it will be a ſtrange injuſtice, if while on the one ſide they charge us with ſuch foul accuſations, they will not allow us on the other ſide to declare thoſe things that are eſſential to our juſtification. We will declare them then, but no otherwiſe then Hiſtorically, and upon the proper Teſtimony of thoſe Authors which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> approves, with a deſign rather [nakedly] to ſhew them, then [ſubtilly] to repreſent or exaggerate them.</p>

In the firſt place, Our Fathers beheld, that inſtead of having kept that Evangelical ſimplicity which Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles had ſo much recommended by their Sermons, and their Examples, they had on the contrary framed the Government of the Church, according to the Platform and Model of Secular Empires: They ſaw an almoſt innumerable Company of Dignities, elevated by Pompous Titles, Canons, Honours, Preeminencies and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, upheld by the vaſt Riches and the Splendor of the World, and all of them together depending on a Soveraign High-Prieſt who had lifted himſelf up above the whole Church, as its rightful Monarch, yea as a Divine Monarch, whoſe words muſt be Laws, and whoſe Laws Oracles, who pretended to reign not only over the external Actions of men, but to Lord it alſo over their Souls, and their Conſciences, and who left nothing ſo reſerved in the deepeſt and moſt inward motions of the Soul, of which he did not demand its Subjection. It had been very hard, if our Fathers had not found in the midſt of the Grandeur of this Body ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, ſomthing very much alien to the natural Aſpect of the Church of Jeſus Chriſt, which is much rather a Miniſtry, then an Empire, in reſpect of its External Government. Indeed, if Jeſus Chriſt had had a deſign to have eſtabliſhed ſuch a Dominion as our Fathers beheld eſtabliſhed, he had never told his Diſciples that which he ſaid to them, <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe Lordſhip over them; and they that exerciſe Authority upon them</hi>

                  <hi>are called Benefactours. But it ſhall not be ſo with you: but he that is great among you let him be as the leſs, and he that is chief, as he that doth ſerve.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> would never have ſaid to the Paſtors of the Church that which he told them, <hi>Feed the ſtock of Jeſus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt which is committed to you, not as being Lords over God's Heritage.</hi> It had then already from thence, in that very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, a great ſign of its Corruption. It was an evil, but an evil that diſcover'd divers others. For it had this appearance with it, that the Spirit of the World had got poſſeſſion of the Miniſters of the Church, till it made them forget what they were in their firſt Inſtitution, beyond which it had made them often commit many outrages.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They had not contented themſelves to eſtabliſh a Spiritual Dominion upon the plat-from of Secular ones, unleſs they joyned the very Temporal one it ſelf to it. The greater part of the Biſhops were become Lords properly ſo called, and even ſome of them had got to be Soveraign Princes, with the Titles and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regatives
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97749:13"/>
of other Princes and Lords, without any difference: had not the <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves done far better, if they had put themſelves in poſſeſſion of that which they now call the State of the Church under the quality of Temporal Lords and Monarchs? I will not mention by piece-meal the Diſorders the Complaints, the Contentions, the Wars that this Spirit of Temporal Dominion has raiſed: This is not my deſign. It is ſufficient for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that one can ſcarce give a more certain Character of the Corruption of a Church, then that. For where that Spirit reigns, it is by that, that men will eaſily bring in Errors and Superſtitions, at leaſt thoſe that can bring them any advantage, and thoſe that have a tendency to adjuſt the Crown with the Miter, and the worldly Grandeur with the Dignities of the Church. It is not very eaſy in ſuch a ſtate to be ſtudiouſly watchful over the Flock, and much leſs to repel the Doctrines, the Cuſtomes, and the Maximes that can any ways advance or favour that Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Covetouſneſs is almoſt always inſeparable from Ambition. They are thoſe two things that nouriſh and mutually ſuſtain one another. So, our Fathers ſaw them reigning together through a long tract of time among the Church-men. I will not here ſpeak of the complaints which they made many Ages ago of the Avarice of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe I ſhall mention ſomething about them hereafter in this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I will only ſay, that thoſe Complaints were univerſally extended to all the Clergy, whom they reproacht with an inſatiable greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heaping up of Riches. The vaſt ſtocks they had gained, the great Cares they took to hinder an Alienation, and procure an increaſe, would not poſſibly be the worſt proofs. But as that evil ſpread it ſelf very far, ſo it was lamented for a long time after, <hi>They feed on the ſins of my people,</hi> ſaid St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who lived <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bernard</hi> in <hi>Cant. Serm.</hi> 77. Item, <hi>Serm.</hi> 33. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col. Cuſan.</hi> lib. 3. de <hi>Concord. Cath.</hi> c. 29.</note> in the twelfth Century, <hi>that is to ſay, they require money for their ſins, without making any other account of the Sinuers, Who of the Clergy may you not obſerve far more careful to empty the Purſes of thoſe ſet under them, then to deſtroy their Vices? A diſorderly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of thoſe Lands that are annexed to the Churches, ſaid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> Cuſanus, <hi>dwells at this day in the hearts of the aſpiring Biſhops, ſo that we ſee them do that openly after their promotion, which they ſecretly coveted before. All their Care is for the Temporal, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the Spiritual. But this was never the mind of the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. They did not then think that the Spiritual affairs would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulpht</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97749:13"/>
                  <hi>in the Temporal, when they gave thoſe goods to the Churches.</hi> So, our Fathers were but too well acquainted with that Spirit of Avarice with animated the Governours of the Church in their Days, and every one knows that one of the matters that very much Scandalized them, and made them deliberately examine the ſtate of Religion, was the Traffick of Indulgences. In effect what likelyhood was there, that a Vice that corrupts all things, and which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the root of all evil,</hi> and elſewhere a kind <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10, 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 5.</note> of Idolatry being as it was for many Ages ſo univerſally ſpread over the Clergy, over the Head, and the Members, even to the Monks themſelves, what likelyhood I ſay was there, that this Vice, which was found to be ſo much increaſed by their Superſtitions, ſhould have left Religion in its natural purity?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our Fathers diſcern'd a prodigious neglect of the Functions of the Miniſtry joyn'd with that Covetouſneſs. For a Preaching Biſhop was for a long time ſo rare, that it was altogether unuſual. The Care of the poor, the viſiting of the ſick, the comforting the Afflicted, the correcting the Ignorant, the ſtudying of the Scriptures, and all the other offices belonging to the Paſtoral Croſier, were, if not quite quite abandoned, yet at leaſt extremly neglected, All was may almoſt reduc't to ſaying of the ſervice as one ſpeak, and to reading of the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, &amp; the Formularies of a Liturgy, which a very few of the People under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and neither he himſelf ſometimes who read it before them. It was this that made <hi>Nicholas de Clemangis</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> who flouriſhed in the beginning of the fifteenth Centuary, to ſay, that <hi>the ſtudy of the Holy Scriptures, and thoſe who taught them were derided by all, and that which is yet more amazing, is that it is chiefly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nicolaus de Clemangis de corrupto Statit. Eccleſiae.</note> 
                  <hi>the Biſhops that ſcoff at them, preferring their own Traditions to the Ordinances of God. Now a days, the charge of Preaching which is an Office ſo admirable and ſo glorious, and which heretofore belonged to the Paſtours only, is now thought ſo vile by them, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which they judge more unworthy of their Grandeur, and to bring more reproach to their Dignity.</hi> He adjoyns, that they made no difficulty openly to profeſs, <hi>that it belonged only to the begging Fryars to Preach, and not to them.</hi> But this Negligence did not ſpring up in that Age of the Reformation, nor in that, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly preceded it, for ſince the ninth Century the Paſtors of the Church have been extream ſlack in dreſſing the Vineyard of our Lord. Which could not but have made way for falſe Doctrines and Superſtitions, and have cauſed a very great alteration in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

5. Ignorance was one inevitable Conſequence of that care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs of the Miniſters of the Church, that is to ſay, that which of all things in the world was the moſt improper to engage any to have relied on their Conduct, and to have reſted aſſured of the ſincerity of their inſtructions. This Ignorance was very great and very general, in the time of our Fathers, and the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced of our Adverſaries will not deny it. But it had began a great while before their days, as it appears, from the Barbariſm of the Schools, and from the matter and ſtile of the greateſt part of the Books that the preceding Age had produced, and from the expreſs Teſtimony of divers Authours. <hi>The Church of God,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Bernard, every day in divers manners finds by ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>in what great danger ſhe is, when the Shepheard knows not where the Paſtures are, nor the Guide, where the right way is, and when, that very man who ſhould ſpeak for God, and on his ſide, is ignorant what is the will of his Maſter. In theſe days,</hi> ſaid <hi>Marſilius</hi> of <hi>Padoua</hi> in the fourteenth Century, <hi>in theſe days wherein the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church is corrupted, the greateſt part of the Prieſts and Biſhops are but meanly inſtructed in the Holy Scriptures, and I dare ſay they are uncapable of deciding the doubts of their Faith. For Ambition, Covetouſneſs, and Canvaſſings obtain the Temporal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and they purchaſe in effect by their ſervices, or by their prayers, by their Gold or by their Favour, all the Dignities of the Age. God is my witneſs, and a great number of his faithful alſo, that I remember I have ſeen many Prieſts, many Abbots, and many Prelats ſo void of knowledge, that they have not known how to ſpeak even according to the Rules of Grammar.</hi> Is it not very natural to conclude that a number of Errors and Superſtitions would infallibly accrew from the favouring of this Ignorance, and thereby be eſtabliſhed in the Church, and that that, would produce Novelties, and that thoſe which formerly were but private opinions, or which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted but in ſome firſt diſpoſitions and [tendencies] to Errors, would become general, and be changed into habits?</p>
               <p n="6">6. But, might not our Fathers very well conclude the ſame thing from that dreadful depravation of manners, which they and their Fathers had ſeen reign for ſo long a time among the Church-men? Thoſe who have any knowledge of Hiſtory are not ignorant of the Lamentations that all honeſt men made then, and the mournful deſcriptions that they have left of thoſe times in their writings. One may read for the twelfth Century, only St. <hi>Bernard;</hi> for the thirteenth, Cardinal <hi>Hugo;</hi> for the fourteenth,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97749:14"/>
                  <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mende;</hi> for the fifteenth, <hi>Werner Rollewink</hi> a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſian Monk</hi> of <hi>Cologne;</hi> for they ſay but too much for the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of theſe Articles; and for the ſixteenth, which was the Age of the Reformation, who does not know that it was extremely corrupted? One of the matters of which the Ambaſſadour of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſo vehemently complain'd before the Council of Trent, on the behalf of his Maſter, and upon which he ſo much inſiſted, was, the wicked lives of the Clergy, where he ſaid, <hi>that he could not deſcribe their horrible wickedneſſes without offending</hi>

That the Clergy was defamed by reaſon of their Luxury. That the Civil Magiſtrate did not ſuffer any Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to have a Concubine, that notwithſtanding amongſt the Clergy it was ſo common a thing to have them, that amidſt a hundred Prieſts one could not find above three or four who either kept not Whores, or were not Married, the one ſecretly, and the others publickly.

I acknowledge, the ill life of the Paſtour is not of its ſelf a ſufficient reaſon to ſeparate from him; but I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97749:15"/>
affirm, that when that wicked life is found to be ſo general in the Clergy, and remains there for ſome Ages without amendment, it gives a prejudice exceeding reaſonable of ſome great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that very Religion it ſelf: For Men of ſuch impure man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners can be but very ill Guardians of Faith and Piety.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Corruption of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in particular, that is to ſay, of that Church which calls her ſelf <hi>the Mother and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs</hi> of all others, and which had in poſſeſſion the Government of them according to her own will, confirmed our Fathers in this prejudice. For by this means they ſaw the Evil did not confine it ſelf only to the borders, but that it was got into the very heart it ſelf, that is, into that Church which as the Chief, ſhed its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the others. Further, I think I need not prove that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, where every one will yield it as a thing that cannot be conteſted. Thoſe who have read the Hiſtories of <hi>Luitprand,</hi> of <hi>Glaber,</hi> of <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> of <hi>Platina,</hi> of <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> and of many others, cannot deny that ſince the ninth Century, the See of <hi>Rome</hi> has been moſt frequently filled with Popes, whoſe Lives and Government have not very much edified the World. Every one knows the Complaints that all the Earth had made, and which it made yet in the days of our Fathers, not only againſt the <hi>Popes,</hi> but againſt all that they call the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Corruption whereof, was looked on as the Cauſe of that in all the other Churches. I ſhall not urge this matter further, but it ſeems to me that our Fathers did not deſerve the leaſt blame, if they could not believe that ſuch a ſort of men, could have a great zeal for the glory of God, and the Salvation of men, or that they were ſo fit and likely to preſerve Chriſtianity intire amongſt them, nor in fine, that whereas it was for ſo many Ages accuſed to be the very Center of all Vices, it could be the Centre of all the Doctrines of Faith and Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But altho' our Fathers ſhould not have reflected on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch men, yet it is very certain that they found enough Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Irregularity in the Maxims, in the pretenſions, and the Government of the <hi>Popes,</hi> to make them juſtly conclude, That they could not but be very ill Conſervators of the purity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. What elſe could they gather from that exceſſive Pride ſo intolerable to all Chriſtians, that conſiſted in making their Feet to be Kiſſed with a ſubmiſſion far beyond what was yeilded to Kings, in making themſelves to be born on the ſhoulders of men, and to be ſerved by the greateſt Princes, or by their Ambaſſadors,

I could add to all that I have ſaid, a multitude of other things, that could not but have been very proper to have raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe prejudices in the minds of our Fathers, whereof we have ſpoken. For thoſe unjuſt ways which <hi>Rome</hi> has made uſe of to draw all affairs to it ſelf, with all the Riches of the Weſt, all the underhand Canvaſſings, and ſtrange Practices it has uſed in the Elections of <hi>Popes,</hi> the Scandalous Schiſms that have ſprung from the Diviſions of Parties, and Differences of Elections, The Bloody Wars that the <hi>Popes</hi> are accuſed to have divers times kindled among Chriſtian Princes, the Intrigues, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt ways whereby they are ſaid to have ſerved themſelves, to engage the Kings and Grandees of the World in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, the endeavours they have always uſed to elude the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of a Reformation; all theſe things ſufficiently diſcover more of the Spirit of the World, then of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, and will eaſily perſwade all thoſe who are not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their Reaſon, that there muſt needs have been latent at the bottom an extream Coruption.</p>
               <p>But we ought to make an end of this Chapter, and to leave a matter ſo ungrateful, into which we had not at all entred, if we had not been obliged by the neceſſity of a juſt defence, as I have before declared.

that they cannot, at leaſt without renouncing all equity, any more condemn our Fathers, either of raſhneſs or preſumption, if they durſt perſwade themſelves, that the Church and Religion were fallen into the very worſt hands, and if they judged from thence that they ought to enter upon a more particular ſcrutiny of thoſe Doctrines that they taught, and of thoſe Laws where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they would bind their Conſciences.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALthough theſe Reflections that I have already ſet down, drawn from the Government of the Church, were very weighty, and by themſelves capable of making the moſt juſt impreſſions on the Minds and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of thoſe who would ſet themſelves to work out their own Salvation, according to the Exhortation of the Apoſtle with fear and trembling, yet we ought not to imagine that our Fathers were determined by thoſe conſiderations alone. They yet made others which they had, that we may yet be more ſenſibly touched by them, ſince they had for their object not the outward Form or State of the Miniſtry, nor the perſons who poſſeſſed the Offices and Dignities of the Church, but their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ſelf, in that State in which it was in their days. For it is moſt true, that it was ſcarce poſſible for thoſe who did the leaſt in the World fix their Eyes on that Religion, to conſider its Draught and its External Form, without diſcovering, or at leaſt without diſcerning infinite Characters of its Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this is that which I deſign to treat of in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One of the chief Objects that preſented it ſelf to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, was that of the great Number of Ceremonies, with which they beheld that Religion either ſhrowded or overwhelmed: It matters little which of the two we affirm, for which way ſoever we take it, it was always a true Pourtrait of the old Oeconomy of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which ſeem'd to be reviv'd in the World. They took ſpecial notice of their external ſacrifices, their ſolemn Feaſts, diſtinction of Meats, of their Altars, of their Tapers, of their ſacred Veſſels, of their Cenſings, of their ſet Faſts throughout the Year, of their myſtical Figures, and a multitude of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things altogether reſembling thoſe that were enjoin'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and in general, a great Conformity to that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient-Worſhip conſiſting in ſuch a Love and Exceſſive uſage of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97749:20"/>
Ceremonies. This was without doubt a Character very oppoſite to that of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, where the Spirit Rules, and not the Letter, and which is made free from all that great cumbrance of External Obſervations. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances, <hi>weak and beggerly Elements, a Yoak of bondage, the</hi>

                  <hi>rudiments of the World, the ſhadow of things to come, whereof the body is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> and St. <hi>Peter, a Yoak which neither the</hi> Jews <hi>in his days nor their Fathers were able to bear.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf told the woman of <hi>Samaria, That the time was come, when the true worſhippers of his Father, ſhould worſhip him in Spirit and in truth.</hi> What likelyhood was there that they would have ſpoke after that manner if the Church of Chriſt her ſelf ſhould be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with as many or more Ceremonies then the <hi>Synagogue;</hi> And, if as <hi>Tertulian</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>God had not removed the difficulties of the Law, to ſubſtitute in their places the eaſy Rules of the Goſpel?</hi> They would have Preached to us the Spirit and Liberty, only to have us ſubjected again to the <hi>Letter,</hi> and to have placed us under a ſervitude far more inſupportable then the Former.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover, as our Fathers ſaw one part of thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies taken from the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo they preceiv'd a multitude of others that were drawn from, or imitated, the Heathens, by their approving of the ſame which they either Authoriſed, or practiſed. For we might put into this rank the uſe of holy water, or water Conſecrated for ſprinkling, in the entrance into Churches as well as private Houſes, and the Funerals of the dead, the bleſſings and the ſprinklings, the uſing of Spittle in the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of little Children, the Invocation of Saints, their Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization, their Patronages, and ordering of their Charges and Imployments; Their Images and Pictures, their <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> their Feaſts for all the Saints, for the deaths of St. <hi>John,</hi> and many others, their uſage of Proceſſions, of Rogations, their viſiting the Shrines or Reliques of Saints, of ſetting up the ſign of the Croſs where four ways met, of Anniverſaries for the dead, of ſwearing by their Reliques, and I know not how many others, that were evidently either the Remnants, or Imitations of Antient Paganiſm. Who would think it ſtrange that an <hi>Idea</hi> of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that plainly appear'd to be ſo little advantagious to it, or to ſay better, which was ſo contrary to the Spirit and the true deſign of Chriſtianity, ſhould have touched our Fathers, and inſpir'd into them a deſire of knowing thoſe things a little more particularly then they had as yet done?</p>

3. They were yet further carri'd out with that deſire, when they conſidered the ill Effects that thoſe Ceremonies borrow'd from the <hi>Pagans</hi> had produc'd, and ſome others that were annexed to them, as Roſaries, Chaplets, holy Salt, their Pilgrimages, and and Monaſtick Vows, and ſuch like things. For they manifeſtly fill'd the minds of men with ſuperſtition, they cauſed a thouſand abuſes among the people, they ordinarily made way for lying Forgeries, and, which rendred them yet far more odious, they fomented a too natural negligence which every one has, for works of true and ſolid Piety, whether, by buſying the minds of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans too much, or perſwading them, that they had very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted themſelves of their duty by doing theſe External things, or laſtly, whether it was by infuſing into them a falſe <hi>Idea</hi> of Divinity, as if all its worſhip did conſiſt in ſuch Trumpery. Who is it that ſees not what a great prejudice this was againſt a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that taught ſuch things, and ſo ſolemnly enjoyned them to be practiſed?</p>
               <p n="4">4. It had been yet very hard, if our Fathers had not been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by that worldly Pomp, wherewith they ſaw Religion ſo exceſſively cloathed. For they very well knew, that true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity was contented to gain the Hearts and Souls of men by the Majeſty of its Doctrines and Holineſs of its Precepts. And that for the reſt, it profeſſed to retain its ſimplicity, notwithſtanding which they obſerved a clean contrary Character in the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of their Tenples, in the Gold of their Tabernacles, in the Pride of their Sacrifices, in the Riches of their Ornaments, and in general in all that external ſplendour, which ſeem'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd only to ſtrike extraordinarily the ſences, and by this means to raiſe an ill grounded Admiration, that which is proper to only corrupt Religions, which as <hi>Tertullian</hi> takes notice, <hi>labour to gain their Authority, and to obtain the belief of the People, by their</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tertul. de Baptiſmo.</note> 
                  <hi>Pomp, and their profuſeneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Natural Effect of the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, when they are receiv'd with Faith, and when its worſhip is practiſed with Devotion, is to comfort the Conſcience, and to give it a certain ſatisfaction and calm, which is better felt, then it can be expreſt. But our Fathers were ſo far from receiving that Effect from the Doctrines and worſhip wherein they made in their days almoſt the Fundamentals of Religion to conſiſt, as in the Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints, the abſolute Obedience to the <hi>Pope</hi> or to his Councils, the conceit of Mens ſatisfactions, the Adoration of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97749:21"/>
Reliques, the Pilgrimages and other things of the like nature; they were I ſay, ſo far from receiving it from theſe Doctrines, that on the contrary they could not but feel ſecret remorſes after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving practiſed them. For the Conſciences of Chriſtians are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally carried out to none but God alone, and cannot endure that that which is due to him, ſhould be divided between him and the Creatures. They have naturally a reluctance, to call upon any other Being then the firſt Cauſe of all, to pay a Religious ſervice to lifeleſs Images, to ſubject themſelves to any other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle, then that of God, to attribute any part of their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any others beſides Jeſus Chriſt, who has acquired for them a fullneſs of Salvation; And in a word, to lay hold on any Creature as the object of their Confidence or Piety; ſo our Fathers knowing from their own Experience, that theſe Tenets and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions were, not only barren of all that quiet, but at the ſame time contrary to the peace of their Souls, they could not but receive a great prejudice againſt thoſe Tenets, and againſt thoſe Devotions themſelves, and againſt that Religion that propoſed them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But that was not all, they ſaw yet many things in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion moſt formally oppoſite to many plain and expreſs paſſages of Scripture; As the point of Images, to the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image, &amp;c.</hi> That of Communion only in one kind, to that Command of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> That of Praying in an unknown Tongue, to the Prohibition of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the fourteenth of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians: Elſe, if thou ſhalt bleſs with the Spirit, how ſhall he that occupieth the Room of the unlearned, ſay Amen at thy giving of thanks, ſeeing he uuderſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt? For thou verily giveſt thanks well, but the other is not Edified.</hi> And the buſineſs of blind Subjection to the Miniſters of the Church, to that ſtrict Declaration of the Apoſtle, <hi>We have not Dominion over your Faith.</hi> That of the <hi>Papal Monarchy,</hi> to theſe words of our Saviour, <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe Lordſhip,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but it ſhall not be ſo with you,</hi> That of humane ſatisfactions, to the words of St. <hi>John, The blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> And that of the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> to that Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews, That Jeſus Chriſt has once offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us.</hi> I do not at all enquire, whether the force of theſe paſſages may be eluded, and diſtorted to a ſence that may agree with thoſe points which I have mentioned, I do not enter upon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97749:21"/>
that. It is enough if any ſee that oppoſition of which I ſpeak to appear at 1 ſight, that it likewiſe ſtrikes the Soul, and ſeems at leaſt ſtrong enough to Create great ſcruples, and to form a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice that carri'd our Fathers on to examine thoſe things a little more narrowly.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To which they were yet further urg'd by the Conſideration that they made of ſome Maxims and Diſtinctions which they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily made uſe of to uphold the worſhipping of Creatures, for they diſcovered in them ſomething that was extremly Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous. For Example, where they maintained the Worſhipping of Angels, and that of the Saints, by ſaying, that they did not adore them, but by a lower ſort of Adoration, proportioned to the excellency they acknowledged to be in them, not, that they gave them that ſupream Adoration which is due to none but God alone. I do not here put it in Queſtion, whether this diſtinction be good or bad, it is ſufficient that it had the ill luck to fall in with that which the Antient Heathens made uſe of for the defence of thoſe Adorations which they paid to their Genius's, to their Heroes, to their Demy, and inferiour Gods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Pagans ſaid the ſame, that men did them great wrong in laying it to their charge, that they worſhipped their Genius's and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Gods with that Soveraign Worſhip, which they gave to none but the chief and greateſt of the Gods. And that that worſhip about which the Queſtion was, was only an inferiour and lower kind of Worſhip. So they defended their worſhipping of Images by that Diſtinction of Abſolute and Relative Worſhip; but that was the very ſame diſtinction which the Pagans ſerv'd themſelves of, to excuſe the Worſhip they rendred to the Statues of their Gods, alledging, that any one very much wrong'd them, in imagining that they ſerv'd Stocks of Wood, or Stones, but their Devotion was carried out only to thoſe objects that thoſe Statues repreſented. They defended the Invocation of Saints by that diſtinction, That they did not pray to them, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of thoſe graces which they deſired, but only as they were meer Interceſſours before God. But yet the very Heathens ſaid the ſame as to thoſe Prayers which they offered up to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Gods, whom they acknowledg'd to be but as the Friends and Favourites of the great God, whom they made uſe of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him to obtain bleſſings for themſelves. They defended a Company of Opinions and Cuſtoms in their Religion, by ſaying, that they were the Traditions which they had received from the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97749:22"/>
hands of their Fathers; but that defence had yet this unhappineſs; that it favoured the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt thoſe cenſures of Jeſus Chriſt, and that which Jeſus Chriſt had wholly beaten down by thoſe words, <hi>in vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of men.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. We might here very well joyn to what has been ſaid, the ſcandal our Fathers muſt needs have taken at that School-Divinity, which for a long time had fill'd the World with Queſtions not only vain and frivolous, but pernicious alſo, and leading men to wickedneſs; we could make a long Catalogue of thoſe Queſtions, if the common intereſt of Chriſtianity did not oblige us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them from the Publick, but becauſe we fear the ignorant or the malicious will lay it to our charge that we would impoſe on the World under a pretence of an affected modeſty, we will ſend our Readers to that Collection which Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has made in his Treatiſe of the Euchariſt. <hi>Page</hi> 920. where I aſſure my ſelf they will find on one only Article, which is that of the Incarnation of the Word, more then enough to juſtify that which I have ſaid. What can any one think of ſuch a manner of treating of the Myſteries of Religion, and of that Art they had joyn'd with it, to defend all things by, and that even the moſt remote from ſence, and by diſtinctions crude and ſenceleſs, if it were not, that all that was very likely to raiſe an abundance of Errors, and excellently contrived for the maintaining of all ſuch, as Ignorance, Paſſion, Engagements or Intereſts would yet have produced? I know that the wiſer ſort among our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, are themſelves aſhamed of it, but they cannot deny that it was almoſt the only way of Teaching the Divinity of <hi>Rome</hi> for a long time before the Reformation, and that it was but a very juſt prejudice againſt the State of Religion, that depended ſo abſolutely on that of the Schools.</p>
               <p n="9">9. One of the Effects of that diſorder of the Schools, was the depraving of Chriſtian Morality, by the introduction of divers deſtructive Maxims, which tended only to corrupt men's minds and hearts, as well in reſpect of Piety towards God, as of Juſtice and common Charity toward men, and of that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance that every man ought to maintain in his Actions. It would be too long to relate in this place all the proofs that make good this Charge, I ſhall content my ſelf to alleadge only ſome Pieces that have made too much noiſe in the World to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, They are on one ſide the Provincial Letters aſcribed to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97749:22"/>
Mr. <hi>Paſchal,</hi> and ſome other Treatiſes which we have ſeen Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd againſt the Moral Divinity of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> And on the other ſide, The Apology for the <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> and the Book of <hi>Amedeus Guimenius.</hi> Thoſe former pieces accuſe the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of Teaching and eſtabliſhing Maxims, Raſh, Erroneous, Scandalous, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together contrary to good manners, and the others let us ſee, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in that reſpect, is wholly like to that of the Antient School-men, and that one cannot condemn the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> without condemning at the ſame time the whole An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient School of the Roman Church. For Example, The one ſort accuſes the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of Teaching, That it is lawful for one man to rejoyce within himſelf at the death of another, and to deſire it, not only when it is an evil to him who ſuffers it, but alſo when it is advantageous to him who deſires it. But <hi>Guimenius</hi> ſhews us, that, that is exactly the Doctrine of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> of <hi>Cajetan</hi> and divers others, who all maintain the ſame. The one accuſes the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> for Teaching, That it is but a Venial ſin, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to Divine Inſpirations. But <hi>Guimenius</hi> ſhews, that that is alſo the Doctrine of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Cajetan.</hi> They accuſe the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of Teaching, That it is lawful to adviſe and at the ſame time to draw in a man to commit a leſſer Sin, to avoid a greater Evil; As to perſwade a Laſcivious man to meer Fornication, that he may avoid committing Adultery. But <hi>Guimenius</hi> proves this to be the Doctrine of <hi>Cajetan, Sotus,</hi> and <hi>Sylveſter Prierias.</hi> They accuſe the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of maintaining, that a man may, not only not remove an occaſion or ground of ſin from another whom they know will abuſe it to that end, but that they may at the ſame time preſent it to him, and by that means lay a ſnare for him to make him fall into Sin, provided, they do it with a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either to correct his Viciouſneſs, or to make him ſhun ſome other inconvenience; ſo that a Husband who is jealous of his Wives committing Adultery, may preſent her with an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity or occaſion to commit it, and a Father may lay an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his Childrens way to ſteal from him. But <hi>Guimenius</hi> lets us ſee that this is the very opinion of <hi>Aquinas, Sotus, Navarr,</hi> and of <hi>Cajetan.</hi> I omit an abundance of other beaſtly caſes, which no one can propoſe without wounding his modeſty. They will ſay to this, it may be, that the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> has cenſured that Book of <hi>Guimenius:</hi> but this Anſwer ſignifies nothing, for we are not concerned to know what the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> holds in theſe days, nor what it approves or condemns, but to know, whether thoſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97749:23"/>
Authors that <hi>Guimenius</hi> has alledged, are well or ill quoted, whether it were not true, That thoſe Scandalous and Pernicious Maxims were taught in the School in the days of our Fathers, and whether our Fathers ought not to have looked on them as evident and certain proofs of a great corruption?</p>
               <p n="10">10. I know not whether we might not here make a particular Reflexion on the procedure of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which notwithſtanding the ſafe conduct granted by the Emperor <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> to <hi>John Huſs,</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> made no ſcruple to condemn them to be burnt alive, and to Cauſe that Sentence of their Condemnation to be executed. For ſo that Council vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the publick Faith, by a moſt Solemn and reſplendent Action. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Conſtant. Seſſ.</hi> 19.</note> But it was not contented with that, unleſs it did at the ſame time add a Decree that it expreſly made on that Subject, bearing this with it, that all Letters of ſafe Conduct granted to Hereticks by any Emperors, Kings or Princes, ought not to hinder the Judges [to whom it ſhould appertain to take Cogniſance of their Crimes, whether they were Lay-men or Church-men,] from proceeding againſt them, and puniſhing them with the greateſt ſeverity. <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> relates that that ſentence, through the force of which they were expoſed to the Fire, was given in Full Council, <hi>Lata eſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in conceſſu Patrum adverſus contumaces ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia, CREMANDOS eſſe qui Doctrinam Eccleſiae reſpuerent,</hi>

                  <hi>prior igitur Joannes combuſtus eſt, Hieronimus diu poſtea in vinculis habitus, cum reſipiſcere nollet, pari ſupplicio affectus.</hi> He adds, that thoſe two men ſuffered that Torment, with and admirable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſinging of Hymns in the midſt of the Flames. This was in that time very aſtoniſhing, to ſee a Council gathered in a Body, wholly intent upon the cauſing the death of two Chriſtians; ſince it is certain amongſt Chriſtians, that the Church has no power over the Temporal Lives of men. But that Scandal was yet made greater by the way they carried it on, for to come to that, they made no difficulty of violating all that was the moſt ſacred and inviolable in humane Society, I would ſay, the publick Faith given by the Authentick Authority of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Magiſtrate, and given, with all the appearances of their own conſents, as one may collect from the Words of <hi>Aeneas Sylvius.</hi> For he ſays as that Council was labouring in the affairs of <hi>Bohemia, Placuit tandem, Sigiſmundo Imperatore ſuadente, Joannem &amp; Hieronymuus ad Synodum vocari. They thought good through the Entreaties of the Emperor</hi> Sigiſmond, <hi>that</hi> John <hi>and</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:97749:23"/>
Jerome <hi>ſhould be called to the Council.</hi> They then made no ſcruple of violating that Faith, to which they had conſented, and not only to break it by that Action, and in that Practiſe, but fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at the ſame time a Decree to authoriſe that breach of Faith, and made it a lawful Rule for Poſterity to go by. Who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that our Fathers had not here a juſt cauſe to be ſhaken at that management of affairs which had violently born down all that wiſe and moderate men ſince have conceived, and that they had not reaſon to joyn that to all thoſe other things I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as a moſt powerful prejudice againſt a Religion that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it ſelf, by ſuch ſtrange proceedings?</p>
               <p n="11">11. They might have added alſo to the reſt, methinks, the eſtabliſhment of Inquiſitions, and uſage of <hi>Croiſado</hi>'s againſt thoſe who were pretended to be Hereticks. For it is moſt true that ſuch a way of maintaining Religion by Torments and Armies raiſed by the Clergy, as the Popes had uſed ſome ages ſince againſt the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> the <hi>Wicklifiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Huſſites,</hi> was not at all proper to make it be beloved, or to inſtil into mens minds an extream good opinion of it. There where they would introduce the Faith by force, they ſhut up peoples hearts inſtead of gaining them. That courſe is good no farther then for Temporal Monarchies, or Mundane Religions, where men are not much concerned whether they reign over the Spirits of men, provided they reign over their Bodies. But that is not at all the way that Jeſus Chriſt uſes, who ſets up his throne in their Conſciences, and who knows no other conqueſts but thoſe, which the ſword that comes from his mouth, gains.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But beſides thoſe cruel ways which they made uſe of for the upholding their Religion, they employed yet others, as well as thoſe, which tho' they were not ſo ſevere, did not fail of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as odious, and of raiſing as ſtrong ſuſpitions againſt that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ſelf. I might rank in this place, thoſe falſe Miracles which they invented every day to gain credit to ſome Doctrines and Devotions, which of themſelves had no foundation at all in the word of God. For every own knows how much theſe ſort of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were in uſe in the days of our Fathers, and ſome Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with what care they ſpread them among the people, in Preaching them up with Zeal, and defending them with heat, and in ſtuffing their Legends with them, and other Books of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But every own knows likewiſe that the greateſt part of them were ſo groſly invented, that a very mean underſtanding
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97749:24"/>
could eaſily detect their falſneſs. We might joyn with thoſe falſe Miracles, thoſe ſtories of Viſions, or Apparitions of the Bleſſed Virgin, or ſome other Saint, to the Religious men or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which were ſo frequent that one can find nothing elſe in the Books of the Monks of thoſe Ages. We might Place here alſo thoſe ſo often deviſed Tales of the returns of Souls out of Purgatory, of their Apparitions, their Complaints, and pitiful Groans, of their requeſts to be eaſed of their pains by their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Foundations, and of the outcries and terrible din that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made upon Mens leaſt neglect to perform what they beg'd of them. I do not now examine whether thoſe Doctrines which gave ground to thoſe pretended Miracles, to thoſe Viſions, and Apparitions, were Evangelical or not; it is enough for me to note that, that falſeneſs that appear'd in the greateſt part of thoſe groſs, Inventions, which were ſo often publickly detected, rendred that Religion juſtly ſuſpected, not only in reſpect of thoſe Opinions and Devotions which they pretended to authoriſe by thoſe frauds, but alſo in general, as to all that which came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Traditions.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Might we not ſay the ſame thing of ſo many forged and ſuppoſititious Books, the making and uſe of which had been ſo frequent in the Ages that preceeded the Reformation; not to meddle with what is reported of the Monks, that they did not ſcruple to ſerve themſelves by forged Deeds, to enrich their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and gain Priviledges to them. Without touching upon that, there are few Perſons that are ignorant of what Character the Decretal Epiſtles of the Antient Popes are, collected under the name of one <hi>Iſidore Mercator,</hi> whereof the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> has made ſo advantagious a uſe for the eſtabliſhing of its Authority, and of the pretended donation of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> by which that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is ſaid to have given away the Roman Empire, and all its rights to the Pope. Every own knows alſo how they had forg'd whole Books and Treatiſes under the moſt Antient and Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble names, as the Epiſtle of the Bleſſed Virgin to Saint <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the Works of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Martial,</hi> the Acts of the Paſſion of Saint <hi>Andrew,</hi> by the Prieſts of <hi>Achaia,</hi> the Liturgies of Saint <hi>James,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> and divers others of the ſame nature: None are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how they had mingled ſome falſe pieces into the true Works of the Fathers, as in thoſe of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> of <hi>Origen,</hi> of Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> of Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> of Saint <hi>Hilary,</hi> of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:97749:24"/>
of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> of Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> of Saint <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt generally of all the Fathers, whoſe names they have made uſe of to authoriſe their forgeries. None are ignorant what alterations they had made in the true writings of the Fathers, whether by changing their words, or adding to them, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in cutting off conſiderable clauſes and whole paſſages en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. Who ſees not that theſe ill practiſes, which of themſelves are ſo odious in all ſorts of matters, and eſpecially in thoſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, could not but encreaſe the juſt ſuſpitions that our Fathers had of all that which they named Tradition?</p>
               <p n="14">14. We might make the ſame judgment of that viſible abuſe about Reliques which was brought into the Church. For on the one ſide, the devotion of the people was ſo hot as to that point, that it could not keep it ſelf within any meaſure, and on the other, the Cheats about them were ſo multiplied, that even thoſe of the weakeſt underſtandings could not behold them without being aſhamed of them. That prodigious quantity of the wood of the true Croſs which is ſcattered over the World, witneſſes this; as likewiſe the Slippers and Hoſe of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Shift of the Bleſſed Virgin, her Coifs, her Fillets, her Girdles, her two Combs, her Cloaths, her Wedding-Ring, the Sword wherewith Saint <hi>Michael</hi> fought with the Devil, the twelve Combs of the Apoſtles, ſome of the Stones wherewith Saint <hi>Steven</hi> was ſtoned, the Skin of Saint <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> the Coals that broiled Saint <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Aarons</hi> Rod, the Bones of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> And beyond all that, the multiplication of one and the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, which is to be found in divers places; for there is nothing more ordinary then for one to ſee two, three, or four Bodies of the ſame Saint, as of Saint <hi>Gervaſe,</hi> Saint <hi>Protais,</hi> Saint <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> of Saint <hi>Pretonilla,</hi> Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> and ſome others. All which being very much recommended to the People as the true objects of their Devotion, not only without any certain grounds, but very often with all the appearances of falſneſs, could not but create a vaſt prejudice of corruption in that Church and Religion.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Moreover, when our Fathers caſt their eyes upon the four chief means that God has eſtabliſhed in his Church for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of true Faith and Piety in it, which are, the Scriptures, the publick Worſhip, Preaching, and the Sacraments, and when they conſidered after what manner they were altered, and the uſe of all thoſe means almoſt brought to nothing, it was not poſſible they could do otherwiſe than conclude that corruption whereof we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97749:25"/>
diſpute. For as to the Scripture, inſtead of making that the only Rule of Faith, they had joyn'd Traditions with them, that is to ſay, the moſt uncertain thing in the World, the moſt ſubject to Impoſtures, and the moſt mixed with humane inventions and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Inſtead of recommending the reading of that Divine word, to the Faithful, for their Inſtruction and their Comfort, it could ſcarce be found even in the hands of ſome Church-men. And as for the Schools, they knew far better how to quote <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the Maſter of the Sentences, <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> then the Prophets and Apoſtles. As for the publick Service, they performed it ſome Ages ago in a ſtrange Tongue unknown to the people, who by this means were depriv'd of that benefit which they might juſtly expect. So that the Aſſemblies were become in that reſpect, Springs ſtopt up for any publick edification, and their little Prayers themſelves, the Lords Prayer and the Creed, were then read almoſt only in <hi>Latin,</hi> and the Women, and Children, and People, ſeemed to know God only by the Idea that was given them of that Tongue, in which notwithſtanding they underſtood nothing. As for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beſides that the Pulpit in the greateſt part of that time was abandoned, we have yet ſome Books of the Sermons which they made in thoſe days, as of <hi>Jacobus de Voragine,</hi> of a <hi>Menot,</hi> a <hi>Maillard,</hi> a <hi>Barelette,</hi> a <hi>Diſcipulus de Tempore,</hi> which did no very great honour to their Age. They treat there far oftner of the Legends of the Saints, then the truths of Religion; and that which was yet more deplorable, inſtead of the Word of God, they Preached, almoſt nothing elſe but ſcandalouſly extravagant Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, raw Parallels of a Saint with Jeſus Chriſt, ridiculous ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, pleaſant buffooneries, and ſuch like things, which to ſpeak moderatly, were exceedingly remote from the natural deſign of the Pulpit, and rendred it not only deſpiſed, but after a ſort odious.</p>
               <p>For that which reſpects the Sacraments, [not to touch on thoſe multitudes of unprofitable ceremonies wherewith they had load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them,] we muſt confeſs, that that opinion of the neceſſity of the intention of the Prieſt which was ſo generally taught in the School, and which <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth had defin'd in his Inſtruction to the <hi>Armenians</hi> in the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> it deſtroy'd almoſt all the benefit of thoſe ſacred Myſteries, and caſt mens Conſciences into perpetual ſcruples and uncertainties. For unleſs they could eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a revelation for every particular Chriſtian, what aſſurance
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97749:25"/>
could we have, that he who adminiſters the Sacrament to us, had an intention to do that which the Church enjoyns him to do, or that he had not an intention contrary to that of the Church? What aſſurance could be given, that in all that long Train of Prieſts, Biſhops, and Popes, that is to ſay the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had been from the beginning of Chriſtianity down to this preſent time, there had not been any in whom that intention, which they make ſo neceſſary to the operation of the Sacrament, had been defective? Yet if one only Prieſt that ſhall happen to Baptiſe a <hi>Pope,</hi> had not had an intention to Baptize him, or if he himſelf was not truly a Prieſt, by the default of the intention of him who gave him Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or him who Baptized him; If one only Biſhop who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Orders on a <hi>Pope</hi> then when he is made Prieſt, had not an intention to do what the Church pretends to do, all that which would come in conſequence of that default would be ſpoiled, the Biſhops that that <hi>Pope</hi> afterwards ſhould promote, would not be lawful Biſhops, the Prieſts on whom thoſe Biſhops had conferred Orders, would be no lawful Prieſts, and the Sacraments that thoſe Prieſts ſhould adminiſter, would not be lawfully adminiſtred. What could our Fathers think of ſuch a dreadful confuſion, which they knew not how to undo, unleſs by ſuppoſing a perpetual Miracle? Which is, that God ſhould have ſo over-rul'd the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of all thoſe men, that howſoever Wicked, Atheſtical, Hypocritical or Profane they ſhould have been, yet that not one of them nevertheleſs ſhould fail in having an intention to do that which the Church enjoyns. But what aſſurance have we of ſuch a Miracle, or what promiſe can we find of it in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Not to inſiſt here, that it very ill agrees with the Doctrine of thoſe among them, who make the will of man ſo much Lord of all his Actions, that whatſoever Grace God ſhall manifeſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, it remains always indifferent and free to follow that Grace, or to reject it. It is then very certain that hitherto our Fathers could not be very much edified in the point of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in general; but they were yet far leſs in the matter of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt in particular. For if we look only on one ſide, they were plung'd into that perplexity about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, where they taught one another that the Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bread into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt was the effect of that Conſecration, and that they were bound to Worſhip the Hoſt after the words of Conſecration, as being Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; What aſſurance could they have of ſo important a change? Since
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97749:26"/>
it alſo depended upon ſo impenetrable a ſecret, as that of the intention of the Prieſt, which could only be known by God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, what aſſurance could they have that they were not deceived? What ground had they to give a ſupream Worſhip to an Object of which none could have any certainty of Faith, what likelihood they ſhould believe it to be, that which it was pretended to be, and that it ought to be reckoned an adorable Object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood that God would have given to his Church ſo doubtful an object to be the object of perpetual adoration? Which on one ſide, is ſo viſible and ſo determinate that one may always ſay, <hi>Behold it,</hi> but of which notwithſtanding no one can be aſſur'd that it is that indeed? Is it any ways agreeable to his goodneſs and his wiſdom, to leave the Church to be perpetually held in ſuſpence in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable doubt, and expoſed to the danger of taking the Bread for the true Son of God, and the Wine for his real Blood, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the neceſſity of putting that adoration daily to a hazard upon the credit of one man?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That ſuch a Corruption of the Latin Church as our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had conceived, was no ways an impoſſible thing.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THeſe things, were well nigh, the chief Objects that ſtroke the minds of our Fathers, and cain'd them to a more ſtrict examination of the matters of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Whether thoſe motives were weak or ſtrong, juſt or unjuſt, I leave to the judgment of every ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man to determine.</p>
               <p>But, ſome may ſay, what, did your Fathers never call to mind that ſo ordinary Maxim, and ſo generally receiv'd in their days, That the Church could not err, at leaſt in matters relating to Faith, and the general Rules of manners? and if they had ſo call'd it to mind, could they not by that very thing eaſily have repell'd all thoſe importunate prejudices of corruption which you have ſet before us?</p>
               <p>It cannot be doubted but our Fathers did often think of it, but it cannot likewiſe be imagined, that they would not have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſearch a little more narrowly upon what that Maxim was founded, what conſtruction they ought to make of it, if in a word that Corruption, whereof they ſaw ſuch great ſigns had been a thing abſolutely impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay then, in the firſt place, that one of the thoughts that moſt naturally fell into their minds, upon this matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was this, That the ſame thing which has happened almoſt in all human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, might very well befall the Chriſtian Religion in the ſpace of about five hundred Years, wherein it had been in the hands of the <note n="†" place="margin">Latins.</note> Romans. Every one might obſerve it to be chang'd by the ſucceeding Age, to be rendred ſo as it could not be known, and to become quite another thing, than it was at firſt, according as they degenerated from their Original. That inclination that men had to alter the firſt inſtitutions of things, to add to them, or diminiſh from them, to give to them new Forms and new Cuſtoms, Reigned at leaſt as much in our Weſtern Parts, as among other Nations. It Reigned alſo ſo univerſally, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſerved from its Dominion, either in their Languages, or their Diſcipline, or their Profeſſions, or in the Governments of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97749:27"/>
the People, or in their Laws, or in the Diſtribution of Juſtice, or in one word in any of thoſe things that depend in any manner whatſoever, on the management of men. It had been then a kind of Miracle, if Religion had been ſpared, and its Truth, its Worſhip and Cuſtoms regarded and kept with ſo great care, that nothing ſhould be altered in that, either by additions or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutions. And we cannot ſay that Religion being ſo Heavenly and Divine a thing, is alſo above all thoſe accidents. For it is moſt true that it is Divine in it ſelf, and conſequently inviolable <hi>de jure,</hi> and of right; but there is none that ſees it not in effect too often violated through the raſhneſs of men; and our Fathers were not ignorant, that as perfectly holy as it was, yet it was found to be as much or more expoſed to the paſſions and diſorders of the Soul of man, in all other things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But beſides that general Inclination which never fails to change things from their natural ſtate, our Fathers could not but know alſo, that all men did very much lean towards ſuperſtitions and errours in the matters of Religion; They ſaw the proofs of this in thoſe <hi>Chimaera's</hi> wherewith the falſe Religions had filled the World. <hi>Chimaera's</hi> that were yet ſo much the more ſtrange, as thoſe people who believed and authoriſed them, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> did appear, as to every thing elſe to have minds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly inlightened [and refin'd] which made our Fathers clearly ſee that blinde love that men always had for errours in the matters of Religion. And without doubt that very thing carri'd them out to ſuſpect that that pretention to Infallibility was <hi>null</hi> and vain, and that there might very well be Corruptions in the State of the Church of thoſe times; for what likelihood was there, that that ill inclination ſhould have had no place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe of the Latin Church, that it was wholly extinguiſh't beyond a poſſibility of returning, or that the Enemy of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation would not make uſe of it for our deſtruction, or that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made uſe of it, it ſhould remain ſo long without any effect du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the courſe of ſo many Ages?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The example of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whereof the Bible teacheth us the Hiſtory, confirm'd our Fathers in thoſe thoughts. That was the very Church of God, as well as that of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; That Church was purchaſed by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, as well as ours, altho' that Blood had not yet been ſhed. God not only kept his Choſen and his truly Faithful under that Miniſtration, but he had not any other Church, nor any other Miniſtry in all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97749:27"/>
the World, for the Salvation of his Children. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not only that God had the ſame concern in the preſervation of the purity of that Church, as of that of the Latin Church, but that he had yet a far greater. For above this, that Church had external help for the Converſation of its purity, far greater than the Latin Church ever had. For it was ſhut up in one only people, and in one Country only. It had one Language only, one only Tabernacle, one only Temple, but one civil Government, but one only Political Law, and but one King; where the Weſtern Church had all thoſe apart in many places. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that, it could not be kept from Corruptions, not only at one, but divers times: not only in matters of ſmall Conſequence, but after a ſtrange manner, by a heap of depraved Traditions, by falſe gloſſes on the Law, by open Idolatries, and by a multitude of other things, wherewith their Prophets reproached them. Had they not then very great reaſon to think that the Latin Church, which had no peculiar promiſes that it ſhould be kept from Corruption, in being diſtinguiſht from that of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was not more happy then that in the Conſervation of its Purity?</p>
               <p n="4">4. To this example of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> our Fathers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd that of the <hi>Greek</hi> and other Eaſtern Churches, which God had at firſt honour'd with Chriſtianity, as well as the Latin; and that the times had nevertheleſs ſo disſigur'd them, that they did not any farther appear to be what they were heretofore. Indeed into what errours and ſuperſtitions did not thoſe Churches fall? And in how many points does not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> find it ſelf to differ at this day from them? Some of them obſerve Circumciſion with Baptiſm, others keep up the ſacrificing of living creatures, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the Jews; ſome ſolemnly every Year Baptize their Rivers, and their Horſes; others believe that the ſmoke of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe takes away their ſins; others hold, that the Prayers of the Faithful deliver from the pains of Damnation thoſe Souls that are then in Hell; others give Paſs-ports in due Form to the dying, to carry them to Paradiſe; and a thouſand other ſuch-like imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies that are found to be eſtabliſht among thoſe People: Why might it not be poſſible that the Latin Church ſhould have degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated as well as thoſe Churches? Is it, that their Chriſtianity was from the beginning, different from that of the Latin's? or is it becauſe the Latin Church had ſome peculiar priviledges beyond all others? No, certainly, their Vocation was equal on one part, and on the other; and the nature of things being ſo, if thoſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97749:28"/>
Nations had corrupted themſelves, thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> might corrupt themſelves as well as they.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our Fathers who were not ignorant of thoſe Examples, could not but repreſent all to themſelves alſo in my judgment, the times paſt, wherein errours and corruption had viſibly prevail'd over the Truth, even then when thoſe very Churches of the Eaſt and Weſt were joyn'd together in one Body. They knew that that had paſt in the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> in the Councils of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> at <hi>Selucia,</hi> and at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in favour of the <hi>Arrians;</hi> and in a Council at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Eutychians;</hi> without thinking of that which they ſaid of thoſe two Councils held at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in favour of the <hi>Iconoclaſtes</hi> [or aboliſhers of Images] the one under the Emperour <hi>Leo Iſaurious,</hi> the other under <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Copronimus.</hi> That very thing was an evident token to them, that the Latin Church might be very likely in their times fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other corruptions, and that errour had triumpht over truth. For it was not at all impoſſible, that that which had hapned fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in reſpect of ſome errours, might not yet with greater ſucceſs and longer duration happen in reſpect of other errours.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Moreover, They obſerved that Councils of a great name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Latins, as thoſe of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and oppoſed by other Councils, and that in the moſt weighty points of Religion, to wit, in the Caſe of the Supreme Authority that ought to govern the Church upon Earth. For ſome rais'd the Authority of the Councils above that of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and others would have it, that the <hi>Popes</hi> ſhould have an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and an independent, and perfectly Monarchical Rule over the Church; what could our Fathers conclude from ſo manifeſt a conteſt, if not, that it had a vaſt confuſion in it, and that it was exceeding neceſſary to the quiet ſetling of their Minds and Conſciences, to enter on an examination of that which thoſe men taught in the buſineſs of Religion?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Our Fathers were confirmed in that deſign, when they ſet before their eyes, thoſe obſcure Ages through which the Latin Church had paſt. For who knows not what the ninth, tenth, and eleventh Centuries were, not to ſpeak of thoſe that followed them? As for the ninth, <hi>Baronius</hi> is forc't to conclude the Hiſtory of it with ſaying; <q>
                     <hi>That it was an Age of affliction to the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and chiefly to the Church of Rome; as well by reaſon of the complaints it had againſt the Princes of the</hi> Weſt <hi>and</hi> Eaſt, <hi>and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron, ad Ann.</hi> 899.</note>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:97749:28"/>
                     <hi>the Schiſm of Photius, as by reaſon of inteſtine and implacable Wars, which had began then to be formed within the very Boſom of that Church. That this Age was the moſt deplorable, and diſmal, above all the reſt, becauſe thoſe who ought to have been watchful in the Government of the Church, not only ſlept profoundly, but the very ſame Perſons laboured all they could intirely to drown the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-Ship.</hi>
                  </q> For the Tenth, as there are very few Perſons but will acknowledge that it was buried in darkneſs more groſs then that of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſo it will be needleſs here to produce the proofs. The eleventh was ſcarce happier, and <hi>Baronius</hi> begins the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it with a remark of ſo univerſal a Corruption of manners, cheifly among the Church-men, <hi>that it had made way,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for the common beleif of the near approach of Antichriſt, and of the end</hi>

                  <hi>of the world.</hi> How could it be poſſible, that during ſuch gloomy times, Religion, Faith and Worſhip, ſhould be preſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> has joyn'd together Faith and a good Conſcience as two things that mutually ſuſtain one another, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.</note> and has taken notice that thoſe who caſt off a good Conſcience; make Shipwrack of the Faith. <hi>In effect,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome; then when men lead corrupted Lives, it is impoſſible they ſhould keep</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chriſoſt, in</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>hom.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>themſelves from falling into perverſe Doctrines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. To theſe conſiderations, we might joyn that of the two ſorts of Philoſophies which ſucceſſively had reign'd in the Church, to wit, that of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the other of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they had ſtrove to accomodate the Chriſtian Religion. For it is ſcarce to be conceiv'd but that mixture of <hi>Platonic</hi> and <hi>Peripatetic</hi> Opinions with the Doctrines of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould have defaced the Faith, and quite alter'd his true Worſhip. It was for this Reaſon that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had caution'd the Faithful, <hi>to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>take heed that no one ſeduc'd them through Philoſophy, and vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful reaſonings, after the Traditions of men, after the rudiments of the Wiſdom of the World, and not after Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. They will ſay, without doubt, that all theſe conſiderations; how ſtrong ſoever they appear, do yet make no more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures and likelihoods, which ought to have been immediatly ſtifled by the only name of the Church, which improves ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a reſpect for it ſelf in the Souls of all true Beleivers. But that very thing ſerv'd but to increaſe the juſt ſuſpitions of our Fathers; They underſtood what reſpect they ow'd to the Church; but they were not alſo ignorant how eaſie it was to be deceiv'd by ſo ſpecious a Name. That viſible ſociety of men who profeſs
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97749:29"/>
Chriſtianity, which we call the Church, is not wholly compoſed of true Believers, it takes into its Boſome a great number of falſe Chriſtians, of wicked, Worldly and Hypocritical men, who are mingled with the good, as chaff amongſt the Wheat, or as the mud of the Stream is, with the Water of the Fountain. And as on the one ſide, the falſe Chriſtians are not all ſo, after the ſame manner, for ſome are full of light and knowledge, others of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſome are prophane, others ſuperſtitious, one ſort are full of contrivances and intrigues in the affairs of Religion, others take little care of its intereſts; ſome are ambitious, others cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, others fierce and inflexible, others full of impoſtures and deceits, according as we ſee thoſe different humours ordinarily reign among the men of the world; ſo on the other ſide, the true Beleivers who are in the ſame viſible Society, have not all of them the ſame Degree either of knowledge, or ſanctification, that they have more or leſs of natural light, more or leſs of ſupernatural grace, more or leſs of zeal, of courage, or of vigour, according to the meaſure of the Spirit that is communicated to them; it is now almoſt ſcarce conceivable, that that Medley ſhould not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Religion in a long Train of Ages, and that it ſhould not cauſe to enter in, Maxims, Doctrines, Services and Cuſtoms far more conformable to the Spirit of the World, then to that of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>There needs but a little leven,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>corrupt the whole Maſs.</hi> From thence, that two Parties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one is good, the other is evil, are joyned together, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience always inſtructs us, that the ill does far more eaſily deprave the good, then the good better the bad. And we cannot ſay, that God is bound to hinder that Corruption, and that otherwiſe his Church would Periſh from the Earth: For beſides, that it no way belongs to us to order ſo boldly what God is bound to do, or not to do, for the execution of his deſigns; it is certain that he has not hindred it, as we have but juſt before ſeen in the Church of the Jews, nor in the Eaſtern Chriſtian Churches, nor in the the whole Body of the Church in the time of the <hi>Arians.</hi> He has other ways to preſerve his Elect, and his ſincerely Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones, who only are, to ſpeak properly, his Church; he can preſerve them in the midſt of a corrupted Miniſtry, and when that is become impoſſible, he knows how to ſeparate them from the wicked, and to draw them away from their Communion. But we will ſpeak to that more largely at the end of this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:97749:29"/>
10. To go on with our Remarks, That which I have ſaid ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies us with another, which is not leſs conſiderable than the reſt. It is in conſequence of that mixture of the good and the wicked in the ſame viſible Church, that it might fall out, and it has very frequently hapened, that the far greateſt Number, the external Splendour, Force, and Authority, is found among the Party of the wicked, and that they are cheifly thoſe who fill up the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt places in the Church. For as thoſe higheſt places yeild them honour, and the goods of the World in a very great meaſure, ſo it is very natural, that they ſhould be more hunted after and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the men of the World, then by the truly Faithful, who ordinarily are not ſo violently carried out to thoſe things. After that manner, one may very often ſee the Government of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church to fall into exceedingly wicked hands, and then there needs but a capricious Humour, but a Paſſion, but an Intereſt, but a Whimſey, but ſome neglect or ſome other thing of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which it is not hard to conceive to be in ſuch Perſons as we ſuppoſe, to bring into the Church falſe Doctrines, and falſe Worſhip, to which thoſe of the beſt minds ſhall no ſooner oppoſe themſelves, but they ſhall be immediatly quell'd, which often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them to keep ſilence, and to give way for a ſeaſon, till it ſhall pleaſe God to deliver them from that oppreſſion.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Could it not in the leaſt happen, that thoſe errours and ſuperſtitions that were but little taken notice of at firſt, ſprung up in the Schools, or among ſome other ſort of men, ſhould be by little and little, and inſenſibly ſpread over the Body of the Church, by the means of ignorance and negligence of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours? And might not the ſame thing fall out according to the pleaſure and intereſt that the Paſtors might take to ſee them eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh't? that in the end being found to be rooted in mens minds, and as I may ſo ſay, incorporated into Religion, they might be lookt upon as Traditions, or as Cuſtoms that for the future ought to be obſerv'd as Laws. No one can deny that a multitude of things had crept after that manner into the Latin Church; as the keeping back the Cup, which the Concil of <hi>Conſtance</hi> had taken <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Constan. Seſſ.</hi> 13.</note> up in expreſs terms, as <hi>a Cuſtome that had been,</hi> ſays it, <hi>rationally introduc'd, and which ought to be kept as a Law.</hi> It was after the ſame manner that the Celibacy of Prieſts, the Worſhipping of Images, the Diſtinction of Meats, and many other things, which how par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular [and private] ſoever they were at firſt, came after to be made publick, and in the end, to be changed into Articles of Religion.</p>

All theſe Reflexions might ſerve to let our Fathers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that it was no ways impoſſible for the ſtate of the Latin Church to be corrupted; but beſides that Reaſon, thoſe examples, and that experience, which convinc't them of it, they yet farther ſaw the plain proofs of it in the Declarations of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For after whatſoever manner they expounded that <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to the <hi>Theſſalonians, which in his days had began to work,</hi> and that Captivity of God's People, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 18.</note> whom God commanded to <hi>go out of</hi> Babylon, <hi>leſt in partaking of its ſins, it partook alſo of its plagues,</hi> no one could avoid acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging from thoſe two places, but that a great Corruption muſt needs fall out in the viſible Church. <hi>The Myſtery of Iniquity which had began to work,</hi> or to form it ſelf, could not be conceiv'd of but under the Idea of a ſecret Plot, whoſe loweſt Foundations were laid in the very days of the Apoſtles, and which muſt at length after a long Train of Ages have come to its utmoſt pitch, and be manifeſted. And as to that other Paſſage, it ſuppoſes in the firſt place a Captivity of the People of God; <hi>Go out,</hi> ſays it, <hi>of Babylon.</hi> Secondly, a Captivity of that People, who did not yet fail to be the People of God, <hi>Go out of her,</hi> ſays it, <hi>my People.</hi> And in the third place, a Captivity, in which, while they abode, they were in danger of partaking of the ſins of their Oppreſſours, <hi>Leaſt,</hi> it adds, <hi>in partaking of its ſins, Yee partake alſo of its plagues.</hi> All that formed an Idea of a Church that groan'd under the weight of a great Corruption, which eaſily gave way to that thought, that it might poſſibly be the Latin Church as ſoon as any other, and that it might as well fall out in the times of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as in any other ſeaſon.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ANy one may now ſee methinks, from what I have laid down, what Judgment ought to be made of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Infallibility that the Latin Church aſcribed to it ſelf, and by what means they would ſhut our eyes, and reduce us to a ſlaviſh Obedience. We ſhall yet nevertheleſs make here ſome reflexions upon it, and ſee whether it has any ſolid Foundation, and any Juſtice in that claim.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But before we proceed farther, it will be neceſſary to know what they underſtand by that Infallible Church, and examine all the Sences that may be given to this Propoſition, that the Church cannot err. For our Adverſaries themſelves very differently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. In the firſt place then, if they would plainly ſay, That that which has been believ'd, and univerſally practis'd by all thoſe who have compos'd the Body of the viſible Church, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the extent of all Ages, is Infallibly true: I ſay that it is a very uſeleſs Principle, ſince, to ſpeak according to men, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to know that which has been ſo believ'd, and univerſally practis'd. So that one need ſay no more againſt it, but to ſend back thoſe men to an Infallibility of that nature. Who could make a ſearch ſo juſt, ſo clear, and ſo general as he ought, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelf of the unanimous conſent of all the particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, unleſs he could raiſe all that were dead, and underſtand them one after another? I acknowledge that we have the Books of the Antients; but all have not wrote, and who can warrant us that thoſe who have not wrote had the ſame Sentiments with thoſe that have? Who can warrant that the many Books that are loſt were not in very many points contrary to thoſe that are extant? Who can teach us nicely to diſtinguſh what thoſe Authors have wrote in Copying out of, or in imitating one another, from their true and natural Sentiments; and that which they have wrote on their own heads, from that which they have wrote as Witneſſes of the general Belief of their Ages? Who can aſſure us that they were not ſometimes deceived in taking for the general Belief or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97749:31"/>
Practiſe of the Church, thoſe things which were not ſo? For the ſame Caſe happens in theſe very days, that as to thoſe things that ſeem ſo exceeding clear, there are yet a ſort of men who would perſwade us, that we do not very well and perfectly know, what the General belief of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, and that we may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſily deceive our ſelves, and deceive others; how much more then heretofore, when thoſe things were by nothing near ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decided, and ſo manifeſt as they are now at this day? Who can exactly enough tell us what thoſe Articles were wherein all the Antients were univerſally agreed, and thoſe wherein they did not agree, ſince it has very often fell out that one and the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has wrote things very contrary upon one and the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? Who can aſſure us that what three or four Antient Authors had wrote after an agreeable manner, was not one of thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deviations from the Truth, which one may often diſcover in them, which does not at all hinder, but that the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion may be more received, and more general? In fine, there is nothing ſo vain and ſo fallacious, as that pretended Infallibility of the Church, if they reſtrain it to thoſe Doctrines which ſhall be found eſtabliſhed by the unanimous conſent of all Perſons and of all Ages.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Such a kind of Infallibility, would not only have been no hindrance to our Fathers from entring on an examination of the matters of Religion; but it would alſo have obliged them to it. For they muſt always have known whether that which was taught and practis'd in the Church in their days, concerning Faith and Worſhip, had been confirm'd by the conſent of all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Ages, which they could never have known but by ſuch an examination. So that thoſe who in theſe days diſpute with us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the right of the Reformation, will never find any reaſon on their ſide. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt needs be very Infallible with them, but it can be ſo but in one reſpect; I would ſay, in thoſe matters wherein She agrees with the Church throughout all Ages, and with all thoſe Perſons who Compoſe it, which could not in the leaſt have taken away her poſſibility of erring in thoſe matters wherein ſhe ſhould withdraw her ſelf from the Antient Church, and by conſequence ſhe muſt ſubmit her ſelf, her deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, her Doctrines, and her Cuſtoms, to a Rule and an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that was ſuperiour, according to which they ought to be examined.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:97749:31"/>
2. If they underſtand by it, That the Church in every Age cannot err, that is to ſay, for Example, That that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and generally practis'd, and beyond all controverſy, in the Church in the days of our Fathers could not be otherwiſe then true and good, I ſay that they make this a Principle which cannot be to any purpoſe, and from which they cannot draw any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. For how could they aſſure themſelves that all thoſe who made up the Body of the Viſible Church a little before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, did well approve of the Doctrines that they then taught, and the Worſhip that was then practis'd, and how could they diſtinctly and preciſely affirm, that any ſuch thing had been generally received? For it cannot be imagin'd, under a pretence that ſome certain Opinions had been ordinarily taught in the Schools, or that certain Devotions had been commonly uſed, that they ſhould be brought into the publick Service, and ſpread over their Books under that ſame pretence; It cannot I ſay be imagin'd, that there had not been many in the World who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approv'd them, and look'd on them as errours and abuſes, altho' they did not forbear as yet to abide with the reſt in the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And it was certainly from thence, that as ſoon as our firſt Reformers had began to ſpeak openly againſt ſuch kind of things, their voice was heard, and their words receiv'd with the applauſes of, and being follow'd by a great part of <hi>Europe.</hi> For that was from no other reaſon, but becauſe they found all matters ordered ſo readily, and that for a long time they had vehemently breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after Reformation. There is then nothing more ridiculous, then when they would ſend us back to an Infallibility which could never be found there, and of which they can give us no marks or ſure characters that may be had there. Beſides which, if the Church is not Infallible, but only in thoſe things that are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believed and approved of without all diſputes, and if it may err in other matters, none can blame our Fathers for having entred on an examination of them, ſince it had formal oppoſitions to one part of the Church in a great many points, as in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Berengarians,</hi> the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> the <hi>Wicklefiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Huſſites.</hi> They will ſay that theſe were ſuch Hereticks as the Church had condemned. But this anſwer will be but a meer Fallacy; For if then when the Church was divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Parties, and that which was the weaker ſhould have been condemn'd by the ſtronger Part; they would treat all thoſe as Hereticks who ſhould have been condemn'd, to elude, under that
<pb facs="tcp:97749:32"/>
pretence the weight of their oppoſition, and that they might ſtill attribute Infallibility to the ſtronger Party, in reſpect of thoſe very things that are conteſted, this is but to deceive our ſelves, to ſay at the ſame time, That the Church is not Infallible, but only in regard of thoſe things that all generally hold without Controverſie. They ought to change their Principle and to ſay the ſame of it that they affirm in the caſe of that Conteſtation, That their Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility follows the ſtronger ſide, and that thoſe who oppreſs the other by their Intrigues, by their Authority, by the force of their Arms, or otherwiſe, are the truly Infallible, ſince the oppoſition of the others ought not to be looked on but as the Inſurrection of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and not as juſt oppoſition. It will always depend on the moſt powerful to make themſelves Infallible, by beating down all that oppoſe themſelves; for there will need no more for that purpoſe than to condemn them, and they are preſently Hereticks, excluded from all right in their oppoſitions; either this is that which I call a Fallacy, or there never was any ſuch thing in the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if they will indeed change their Principle, and ſay, that that Infallibility is to be placed in the greater number, in the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling party, any one may convince them of the contrary, by the example of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who had made themſelves Maſters of the Church, under the Succeſſors of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> The greater part in the Council, were for them, the Pulpits were for them, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple followed them as they were lead either by their own humours, or by Conſtraint and Force, they Perſecuted the Orthodox, which evidently ſhews the falſneſs of this Propoſition, That the greater number, or that ſide that finds it ſelf the ſtronger, can never err. Jeſus Chriſt had never had any Defenders, if in the days of his fleſh, all had been perſuaded of the Truth of this Maxim.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Experience of the <hi>Arrians</hi> makes it appear more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that Infallibility could not be attributed to that which they call the Church repreſentative, that is to ſay, to the whole Body of Paſtors, or as they ſpeak, to all the Clergy: For it is but too true, that the whole Body of Paſtors aſſembled in a very great number at the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> gave way to the <hi>Arrian</hi> Infidelity, by rejecting the word of <hi>Conſubſtantial,</hi> which ſignified that the Son of God was of the ſame Eſſence with his Father, and declared only, <hi>That he was like to the Father, and that he was not a creature, as other creatures were,</hi> which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he was a creature, altho different from others. They will ſay that it was not of their own motion that theſe Biſhops
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97749:32"/>
made that <hi>Arrian</hi> Confeſſion, but that they were forced to it by the Emperours Miniſters: That moreover, they were deceived by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> not taking notice that that clauſe that the Son was not a Creature as other Creatures, made him always a Creature, and in fine that they rejected the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe they did not throughly underſtand it. But all that is not of any advantage to their Cauſe, for if the whole Body of Paſtors, aſſembled in Council to decide matters of Faith, did determine of Hereſie, either out of weakneſs, or through ſurpriſe or ignorance, ſince they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of it in effect, what does it ſignifie in what manner, or in what reſpect they determined it? Could they call thoſe men In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible who were capable of making a Wicked and Infidel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, in an Article ſo Fundamental as that of the Eternity of the Perſon of the Son of God is, in ſuch a manner, and by ſuch Principles as that came to paſs? We can never commit any faults, but that they muſt have ſome cauſe, but what cauſe ſoever they have, our faults are always faults, and certain Arguments that we are not Infallible.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There are ſome of them that ſay, that Councils are not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible but when they are approved by the Popes. But that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has any ſolid ground, for how can an approbation which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily paſſes after the ſeparation of a Council, poſſibly confer any Infallibility on it? has that any Retroactive vertue, and can that change the ſtate of a thing already paſt? They will ſay, that the Pope does not confer any Infallibility on it, but only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges it, and makes it to be acknowledged by others, and that his approbation is as the Seal and Impreſſion that denotes that ſuch a Council ought to be held Infallible. But if the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is not Infallible, as the ſounder part of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church holds that he is not, what certainty can his approbation give us? May he not err in approving thoſe things which he ought not to approve, and in taking for Infallible a Council, which was really deceived? And let not any one ſay that I produce the opinion of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church to the prejudice of all the others, for after what manner ſoever it be, it ſeems to me that one may very well affirm, without offending any perſon, that it is not an Article of the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to believe that the Pope muſt needs be Infallible, for otherwiſe the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church would be guilty of Hereſie. And from that only it follows, that one could have no ſuch aſſurance as one ought to have to ſettle the Mind and Conſcience in quiet, if it were poſſible for him to err in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97749:33"/>
approving a Council, and by Conſequence, his approbation could not be a certain character of the Infallibility of that Council.</p>
               <p>But why do we uſe Arguments in a matter, in which experience has ſufficiently inſtructed us? The Fifth Council aſſembled at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> on occaſion of three Books publiſhed, the one of <hi>Ibas</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> Biſhop of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> the other of <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Mopſueſta,</hi> and the other of <hi>Theodoret</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> was it not held in ſpight of all the oppoſitions of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> did not that Council condemn thoſe Writings as Heretical, againſt the expreſs prohibitions that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had made, by a publick Decree to Condemn them, and yet notwithſtanding was not that very Council in the end approved by the Succeſſours of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and in fine received throughout all the Church for a True and Holy <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Council? Thoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations therefore are only a juggle, which wholly depend on the capricious humours of the Popes, on their different Intereſts, on their good or ill humours. One Pope diſapproves of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and makes it void, to advance all that he does; by that the Council is remote enough from Infallibility, and ought not to be held for Infallible: another Pope comes, and receives and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of it, and behold on a ſudden that Council changes its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and becomes Infallible.</p>
               <p>Beſides that, did not Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> approve an <hi>Arian</hi> Council held at <hi>Sirmium,</hi> in ſubſcribing an Heretical Confeſſion that had been drawn up, and which Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> calls the <hi>Arian</hi> perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Hereſie ſprung from <hi>Sirmium,</hi> for which he pronounced an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt <hi>Liberius.</hi> For what elſe was that Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Hilar. In frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> in Conſequence of which <hi>Liberius</hi> embraced the Communion of the <hi>Arians,</hi> but a Ratification and real Approbation of the Act of an Erroneous Council? and it ſignifies nothing to ſay, That <hi>Liberius</hi> was in Exile when he committed that Error, for without alledging here what he himſelf declared to the Eaſtern <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Biſhops, That he was in Peace and Unanimity with them, and all their Provinces, in good earneſt, and that he had received that Catholick Faith with all his heart, that he had never in the <note place="margin">Apud Hilar. ibid.</note> leaſt contradicted it, that he had readily given his conſent, that he followed and held it; his Exile and Concern to get away from them, does not hinder but that it ſhould be true, That he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove an Infidel Confeſſion, nor by Conſequence, letting us ſee, that it might very well happen, That the Popes did Authorize the Acts of wicked Councils, and that it ought not to be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that their Approbation makes Councils Infallible, nor that it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97749:33"/>
has any certain ground for declaring them to be ſuch.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That Example of <hi>Liberius</hi> encounters alſo all thoſe who aſcribe that Infallibility to the Popes; for behold one in whom by the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> that Priviledge had no effect. But as that Opinion is not generally received in this <note place="margin">Hilar. ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> Kingdom, and we need not to fear objections from any here, ſo it is needleſs to refute them. I ſhall only ſay, that that Diſpute that <note place="margin">Hieron. in Chron.</note> is in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about thoſe to whom this Infallibility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, whether to the Pope only, or a Council only, or to a Council approved by the Pope, or to the Pope as the Head of the Council, lets us ſee that that pretence in general has no ground; for if in truth the Latine Church had that Priviledge, it would never be ſo uncertain as they have made it, but it would have been known a little more clearly where it reſided.</p>
               <p>However it be, it plainly appears that the Latine Church does not pretend to it, as a Law of Nature, for ſhe is compoſed of no different blood from the reſt of men, nor as a right joyned to the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, nor as a meer quality of a Church, for in that caſe the Greek and other Churches would have the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but that ſhe pretends to it as a peculiar priviledge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were diſtinguiſhed from other Churches, as the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Armenian, &amp;c.</hi> It appears that they would not ſet this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive before us, as a firſt Principle, which is evident of it ſelf, without needing any proof: for in fine, it is not ſo clear that the <hi>Latin</hi> Church ſhould be Infallible, as it is that one and one make two, and that the whole is greater than any of its parts. It is then, certainly, but very reaſonable to demand that they would give us the proofs and grounds of ſo important a right. I mean other proofs than thoſe that are commonly taken from the ſame Authority of that Church. For it will not be enough to confirm that Infallibility, for her only to ſay, I am ſo; every Church may ſay the ſame, and yet not be believed. They ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce proofs, and proofs that come from Heaven, ſince there is none beſides God that can confer ſo great a Right, and they ought to ſhew them to us, to the end we may judge of them and weigh their Cogency and Truth. That being ſo, I affirm that our Fathers were bound to uſe all ſorts of Rational methods to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that Queſtion, whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was Infallible or no? And to look to both ſides to ſettle themſelves in a good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is that, which, in my opinion, none will conteſt. But from thence theſe things will clearly follow. 1. That our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97749:34"/>
Fathers had right to examine one of the Tenets of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, which is that of her Infallibility. 2. That they had right to judge of it according to the Nature of thoſe proofs which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves for, or againſt it. 3. That they might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reject it as falſe, if in their examination of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it appeared to be falſe. 4. That it is neither abſurd nor raſh to maintain, that every one has right to examine a Tenet of the Church and to judge of it. 5. That all thoſe General Objections which they have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to made againſt that Truth are falſe and frivolous, ſuch as theſe, that if one give All, that Liberty of examining, every one may make a Religion of his own. That there is no other way to keep men in the Unity of the Faith. That he who examines, makes himſelf a Judg above the Church. That it is the ready way to bring in a private Spirit, and other ſuch like things, all which are refuted by that one Example in the Point of Infallibility. 6. That if it is no ways abſurd that every one ſhould have right to examine a Tenet of the Church that cannot be proved otherwiſe than by the Scriptures, it is not alſo abſurd to ſay, that that right of ſearching out the true ſence of Scripture belongs to every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. 7. That it is not abſurd to ſay, that a Believer is Maſter of his own Faith, by depending only upon God, and independant on men. 8. That if every Chriſtian has right to examine one of the chief Articles of Religion, it is no ways inconvenient to ſay that he has right to examine all, for there is not leſs danger, nor leſs conſequence, for all than for one. 9. In fine, it will alſo follow from thence, that our Fathers were bound upon that pretence of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church to examine all the Points of that Religion. For firmly to aſſure themſelves of the Truth of that Priviledge, it was not enough to conſider it in its Grounds and its Cauſes which are thoſe Proofs that they call <hi>a Priori,</hi> they ought further to look on it in its effects, that is to ſay, to ſee it in the Doctrines of that Church, in its Maxims, in its Voice, and diligently to take notice whether they may ſee all the Characters of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity reſplendent in it, or whether they may not diſcover ſome Error. It was after this manner that the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt acknowledged and cleaved to him. <hi>I have given unto them,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee. To whom ſhould we go?</hi> Said they to him, <hi>Thou haſt the words of Eternal Life:</hi> Our Fathers had ſo much the more reaſon, to uſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 6.</note> theirs alſo, when all the prejudices of Corruption which we have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97749:34"/>
taken notice of in the foregoing Chapters, preſented themſelves to their ſight. They obſerved there all the Characters of humane Weakneſs, of Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Intereſt, Negligence, of plotting Contrivances, and of the Spirit of the World, and all the other marks of Fallible men, who can then blame them for holding ſo circumſpect a courſe to come to the full and clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth? So that that pretence of Infallibility was ſo far from driving our Fathers from the examining of thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which were taught in their days, that the very ſame thing neceſſarily engaged and led them to it.</p>

They ought then neceſſarily to alleadge ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which belongs to the Latins peculiarly, excluſively from all others; or they ought to come to an acknowledgment that thoſe paſſages do not at all eſtabliſh the Infallibility of a viſible Church, ſince if they did ſo eſtabliſh it, being ſo general as they are, they would have the ſame cogency in favour of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,</hi> and the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> as well as the <hi>Latins.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. In effect, one ſort of thoſe paſſages reſpect the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt, that is to ſay, not that multitude of men who make profeſſion of Chriſtianity, or who live in the ſame external Society of Religion, but the truly faithful, thoſe holy men whom God has inwardly regenerated by his Spirit, and whom he leads to life everlaſting. It is of that Church that it is ſaid, <hi>That ſhe</hi>

               <p n="3">3. They alledge alſo ſome paſſages that recommend to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the having a reſpect for and an Obedience to their Paſtors. Such are theſe, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that rejecteth</hi>

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.</note> cannot ſee what this laſt paſſage ſhould let us ſee, but that all thoſe Exhortations that God makes to the Faithful to have a ſubmiſſion to the word of their Paſtours, denote very truly the Duty of the people in that matter, but they do not in the leaſt ſettle any Infallibility in their Paſtours. For is this that that Jeſus Chriſt would ſay, That the Scribes and Phariſees as long as they ſat in the Chair of <hi>Moſes</hi> were Infallible: he that on the contrary accus'd them of having made void the Commandments of God by their Traditions, and who elſewhere gave his Diſciples ſuch a Charge to take heed of the leaven of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that is to ſay, of their pernicious Doctrines? How many times is that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97749:36"/>
that Reſpect and that Submiſſion recommended to Children to give to their Fathers, in the Scriptures? Is it that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that aſcribes to their Fathers an Infallibility? It is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the Kings pleaſure that we ſhould ſubmit our ſelves to his Officers, and that we ſhould obey them, but he does not mean to advance them to be Infallible, nor to ordain us to obey them, if they ſhall happen to command us theſe things that are directly contrary to his ſervice, and to that Fidelity which we owe to our Soveraign. It is then True that all thoſe Exhortations to hear our Paſtors and to obey their words, are always to be reſtrain'd by this clauſe underſtood, <hi>as far as their words ſhall be conformable to that of God;</hi> that they can never go beyond that, and that they cannot from thence draw any Priviledge of Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As theſe Gentlemen let ſlip nothing that may ſerve for their Intereſts, ſo they ordinarily make uſe of that paſſage in the <hi>18th.</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where Jeſus Chriſt ordains that if any one receive an injury from another, he is to reprove him between himſelf and him alone; and if that firſt complaint ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing, then he muſt take witneſſes with him; and if he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to hear thoſe witneſſes, he is to tell it to the Church; <hi>and if he neglect to hear the Church, he is to be unto us as a Heathen and a Publican.</hi> All that that follows in the cloſe of that diſcourſe of Jeſus Chriſt ſhews, that he ſpeaks there neither of Faith nor Worſhip, but of ſome private quarrels that we might have againſt our Brethren to be taken away, and of the uſe of that Diſcipline. For the mind of our Lord is, that before we break off abſolutely with our Brethren, we ſhould obſerve all the Rules of Charity, and that we ſhould there make uſe of the Church, but if he would refuſe to hear the Church, that in that caſe it was allowed us to treat him no longer as a Brother, but as a real ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Who ſees not that if they would draw any thing of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from that paſſage, they ought to pretend that the Church is Infallible not in matters of Faith, for they are not medled with there, but in matters of Fact, and in the Cenſures that it gives upon private Quarrels, in which nevertheleſs all the World agrees that ſhe may be deceiv'd. And therefore it is that theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are wont to alleadge theſe laſt words, <hi>Tell it to the Church, and if he will not hear the Church, let him be unto thee as the Heathens, and Publicans;</hi> and they alleadge them alſo as ſeparated from the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97749:36"/>
ſequel of that Diſcourſe, becauſe otherwiſe they could not but obſerve that they would ſignify nothing to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In fine, they produce thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, Theſe things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee ſhortly: But</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>if I tarry long, that thou mayeſt know how to behave thy ſelf in the Houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the Truth.</hi> How can, ſay they, the Church be the pillar and ground of Truth, if it is not Infallible in the Doctrines it propoſes as of Faith, and in the Worſhip which it Practiſes? But what likelyhood is there that he would have eſtabliſhed an opinion ſo important, as that of the Infallibility of the Latin Church, on ſuch Metaphorical terms, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not make uſe of upon the ſight of any Infallibility, which ſhould reſpect no other but the Latin Church in particular, and which ſhould much rather have reſpected the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or the other Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> where <hi>Timothy</hi> was then, when the Apoſtle wrote to him, which yet did not fail of falling into Error; in Terms which may be explained in divers ſences, and which have been appli'd to divers particular Biſhops, without yet pretending to raiſe them up to be Infallible, what colour I ſay, is there that they can prove the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> It appears in the end of that diſcourſe of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he never thought of making the Church Infallible, for in all that Chapter, he aims at nothing elſe then to ſet down the duties of Biſhops and Deacons; and after having markt out in particular ſome qualities with which they ought to be endow'd, and from what Vices they ought to be more eſpecially exempt, after what manner they ought to govern themſelves, he adds in the cloſe of all, That he wrote all that to his diſciple, to the end he might know how to behave himſelf in the Houſe of God, which is the Church of the Living God, the pillar and ground of Truth. Who ſees not that that Infallibility, comes not in at all to the purpoſe in that cloſe of the Diſcourſe? Let the Biſhops, ſays he, and the Deacons take heed they be wiſe, ſober, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they hold the Myſtery of the Faith in a pure Conſcience, that their Wives ſhould be honeſt and faithful in all things, that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be well educated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that which I ſay in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I apply alſo to thee <hi>Timothy,</hi> to the end thou mayſt live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameably in the Houſe of God, in the Church of the living God: Add, according to the Interpretation of theſe Gentlemen;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97749:37"/>
Which Church is Infallible and cannot err; and there is nothing of any natural Connexion in it. On the contrary that conceit of the Infallibility of the Church, according to the Principle that our Adverſaries makes uſe of in the Doctrine of the Perſeverance of the Saints, would harden them in ſecurity, for let them do as they will, all would go well, and after whatſoever manner the Paſtors govern, the Church could never be corrupted, nor its Truth be loſt. Which would ſeem far more proper to inſpire negligence into the Biſhops, then to animate them to do their duty. In effect if they cannot tell how to exhort men by motives of that nature, They ought then to confeſs the Truth, to wit, that theſe words, <hi>The Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> note the end, and natural deſign of the Church, that for which ſhe is made, and to which ſhe is called, which is to ſuſtain and bear the Truth, and to make it ſubſiſt in the World, and ſo the diſcourſe of the Apoſtle appears very juſt, and well connected: Behold, ſays he, after what manner the Biſhops ought to frame their courſe, and after what ſort thou oughteſt to live in the Church of God, in behaving thy ſelf in it ſo, as remembring that God has appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to be the pillar and ground of his Truth; Live therefore in that manner that may anſwer that end, or that natural appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church. Juſt as if the King, exhorting one of the Officers of his Parliament to do his duty, ſhould tell him, That he liv'd in a body that was the Pillar and Ground of Juſtice, and the Rights of the Crown; that is to ſay, which is naturally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd for the maintaining Juſtice in the State, and to defend the Rights of the Crown. But as that ſpeech of the Prince would not eſtabliſh any priviledge of Infallibility in the Parliament, ſo neither can that of the Apoſtle do it for the Church: for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties do not always follow their natural appointments, we ſee that they often enough depart from them. I confeſs that the Church does not always wander from its end, nor in all things; yet it cannot alſo be imagin'd that ſhe never departs: For the wicked are mingled with the good in the ſame Society, the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the Church are ſometimes to be found more poſſeſſed by the men of the World, then by the truly Faithful; the very beſt men themſelves are ſubject to weakneſſes, and they ſometimes commit faults of that importance, that may conſequently be dilated by continuance, and all that cannot but produce Errors and Corruptions, which it will be moſt neceſſary to reform.</p>

Behold all thoſe paſſages of Scripture upon which, they ſeem to me, to found that pretenſion of the Infallibility of the Latin Church! To them they joyn ſome Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If, ſay they, it be poſſible for the Church to err, why do we call it holy, as we do in the Creed; <hi>I believe the Holy Catholick</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>M. le Card. de Richelieu. liv.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Church? Such an Aſſembly that is united in the profeſſion of an error, is ſo far unfit to be called Holy, That on the contrary it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, ſince it agrees in a Doctrine that is contrary to the Holy Truths revealed by God.</hi> I anſwer: That if this Argument were good, it would follow, not only that the Church ſhould be Infallible as to matters of Faith, but alſo that ſhe ſhould be impeccable in reſpect of manners, for ſhe is called Holy as well from that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that regards good works, as from that which regards the Faith. The Church is Holy, but yet after an imperfect manner, while ſhe is here upon Earth, and ſhe will never be perfectly ſo, but in Heaven. Furthermore they ought to remember that the Title of Holy, and generally all other Titles of Honour and Glory that are given to the Church, belong to it in truth only, in reſpect of the true Believers, and not in reſpect of the Hypocrites and wicked which are mingled with the good in the ſame viſible Society; and that it is but only on the ſame account of the Good, that all that viſible Body is called the Church. For they are none but thoſe whom God has called to his Salvation, who only can be the true myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt. When then it ſhall come to paſs that the number of the wicked prevails in that Viſible Society, they will fill up the Pulpits, they will be Maſters of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and of Deciſions of Faith, of the Government and Miniſtry of the Church, and will not fail to introduce Errors and a falſe Worſhip; but when thoſe perſons ſhould introduce and authoriſe them, the Church would not ceaſe to be Holy, not in reſpect of thoſe wicked men who waſte it, and corrupt it as much as it lyes in their power to do, but in regard of the Faithful whom God will keep pure by the illuminations of his Holy Spirit, and the methods of his Providence. The Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the midſt of its greateſt Idolatries did not ceaſe to keep the Titles of <hi>a Holy Nation, and a Kingdom of Prieſts,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> had given her, but ſhe kept them, not in reſpect of her Corruptors, and thoſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.</note> wretched men that would have ſeduc't her, but in reſpect of thoſe that were Holy. For it is certain that God has always done that which he did in the days of <hi>Elias,</hi> where he reſerv'd ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men who had not bowed the Knee unto <hi>Baal,</hi> and it is in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97749:38"/>
thoſe that the Church is preſerv'd, and always kept Holy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet further, ſay they, If the Church may err, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm. de Eccleſ. milit. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</note> the Church Repreſentative, that is to ſay, the Body of Paſtors, why do the Councils pronounce <hi>Anathema's</hi> againſt all thoſe who ſhall not conſent to their Decrees? Would it not be very unjuſt to bind men under ſo great a penalty to conſent to things that are uncertain, and which may be falſe? I anſwer, that the force of the <hi>Anathema's</hi> of thoſe Councils depends alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on their Juſtice. If thoſe Councils have lawfully decided controverſies according to the word of God, and if with the Truth they have kept Love and Charity, according to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Apoſtle, their <hi>Anathema</hi> is very efficacious, and all that they bind on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven. But if they have decided any thing againſt the Truth, or againſt Charity, if they have abuſed their Places, their <hi>Anathema's</hi> are vain and raſh, and will fall upon none but their Heads who pronounce them. For God has never ſubmitted his Righteouſneſs to the Unrighteouſneſs of any Prelats. All the force of thoſe Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts depends on thoſe very things which have been decided. <hi>We can do nothing,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>againſt the Truth:</hi> We ought not then to imagine that thoſe <hi>Anathema's</hi> muſt needs be Infallible, we ought not alſo to believe that they could not be rightly uſed if they had not that Infallibility. Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> did not pretend to be Infallible, and yet nevertheleſs he pronounc'd an <hi>Anathema</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hilar. in Fragm.</note> againſt <hi>Liberius,</hi> who was a Deceiver. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not pretend to make us Infallible, and yet notwithſtanding he commands us to <hi>Anathematiſe</hi> even an Angel from Heaven, and himſelf, if he ſhould Preach any other Goſpel then that which he has preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Galat.</hi> 1.</note> unto us. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> did not aſpire after Infallibility, and yet he thunders out his <hi>Anathema's</hi> againſt all the Errours of <hi>Neſtorius.</hi> The ſecond Council of <hi>Tours</hi> never thought of being Infallible, and yet nevertheleſs, it <hi>Anathematis'd</hi> all thoſe who after the third admonition refus'd to reſtore the goods of the Church. In fine, every private Perſon pronounces an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt all Hereſies. The <hi>Anathema's</hi> of the Councils are not the Sentences of the Magiſtrate, the force of which depends on the Authority of him who pronounces them, they are only the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiations, that men make on Gods ſide, as his Interpreters and his Miniſters, of the ſeverity of his Judgments againſt the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleivers, the Wicked, and the Hereticks. And provided that thoſe Denuntiations ſhould be founded on the word of God, as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97749:38"/>
far as the light of the Paſtors of the Church and their good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences could perſwade them, we ought not to doubt but that they would be juſt, altho' they would not be Infallible. For howſoever it be, that good and lawful Councils aſſembled in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, would never pretend that their <hi>Anathema's</hi> ſhould bind any perſon, any farther then their Deciſions and their Canons were juſt, and conformable to the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They add yet, if it were poſſible for the Church to err, it were poſſible for it totally to fall away after that manner, that <note place="margin">

God ſays in <hi>Hoſea, That he would betroth her unto him for ever. Saint</hi> Paul <hi>calls her the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is Eternal. Jeſus Chriſt promiſes <hi>to be with his even unto the end of the World, and ſays, that the Comforter ſhall abide with them for ever, and that the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt his Church.</hi> But it is no need of heaping up theſe Proofs of a thing which was never conteſted. God will always keep a Church upon Earth; that is to ſay, he will always have a number of true Believers, whom he will guide by his Word and by his Spirit, and they are thoſe that are betroth'd to him for ever, and the Myſtical Body of his Son, to whom he will grant his gratious preſence for ever, and an aſſured Victory againſt the Gates of Hell. There is nothing diſputed in that point. Our buſineſs is only to enquire, whether all that Body compoſed of the good, and the wicked, that Aſſembly in which the worldly men and Hypocrites are mixt with the truly Faithful, and that which they call the Viſible Church, can never fall into errour, after what manner ſoever it be. Whether it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for that party of the men of the World which may be ſometimes the ſtronger, to corrupt the publick Miniſtry, and for the ſame in reſpect of ſome errours and ſuperſtitions leſs Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, to infect the Good, and to draw them, tho' not ſo far from the Truth as to make them wholly loſe the true Form of Piety, and Communion with God (for if that might happen, the Church would be brought to nothing) yet after ſuch a manner as that their Faith and their Religion could not be ſaid to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together pure. But this experience juſtifies. For in the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church of <hi>Iſral,</hi> and in thoſe times wherein they had introduc't the Worſhip of falſe Gods into the publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, God had reſerv'd ſeven thouſand men who had not bowed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97749:39"/>
their knees to <hi>Baal,</hi> and that which is moſt conſiderable, is, that that very Religion of thoſe ſeven thouſand was not pure; for they liv'd in that Schiſm that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made, and no more went to render that Worſhip to God which they were bound to pay at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but to <hi>Bethel.</hi> It will ſignify nothing to them to ſay, that the Church then ſubſiſted in the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> for beſides that, that would not hinder any from ſeeing clearly by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of thoſe ſeven thouſand, that God can when he pleaſes preſerve his own in a corrupted Communion, and that yet the far greater number might fall into errour, and that the publick Miniſtry might be contaminated, it will not follow notwithſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that that Church was wholly extinct, which is only that which we ſay: Beſides that, I ſay, it is yet manifeſt, that thoſe two Churches; that of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that of <hi>Judah,</hi> were often found to depart both together ſometimes from the true Worſhip of God, as it appears from that which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſays; That <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.</note> God having given a Bill of Divorce to that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for her Idolatries, <hi>Judah</hi> her Siſter feared not, but that ſhe alſo had turned aſide from his true Worſhip. It appears alſo by that which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Samaria</hi> had not committed half the ſins of <hi>Judah,</hi> who had juſtifi'd her Siſter in multiplying her Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek'</hi> 16.</note> The ſame Hiſtory of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> teaches us concerning <hi>Joram</hi> the Son of <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he clave to the ſins of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> by which he had made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, and that at the ſame time <hi>Joram</hi> the Son of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> and his <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 8.</note> Son <hi>Ahaziah</hi> Reigned in <hi>Judah,</hi> and walked after the ways of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in doing that which diſpleaſed the Lord. But, without going ſo far, is it not true that when Jeſus Chriſt came into the World, he did not find a pure Church upon Earth? The Schiſmatical <hi>Samaritans</hi> had ſo confuſed a Religion, that Jeſus Chriſt did not ſcruple to ſay, that Salvation was of the Jews. The Jews on their ſide had defac'd their Religion by a thouſand ſuperſtitions, and by the falſe Doctrine of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and in fine, they had crucifi'd the Lord of Life, the only <hi>Meſſoas</hi> they expected. Notwithſtanding which, we ought not to believe that the Church was periſhed from the Earth, and that God did not preſerve his Children in the midſt of thoſe Confuſions. The ſame thing happened then, when the <hi>Arrians</hi> had made themſelves Maſters of the Miniſtry of the Church; and when under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, the <hi>Eutichians</hi> prevailed in the ſecond Council of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> For it would be a very abſurd thing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97749:39"/>
to imagine that during the time of the Triumph of thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, there were no more, any true Believers in thoſe Churches, all whoſe Pulpits they had fill'd, and none in all that Communion but thoſe who obeyed the erronious Councils of <hi>Milan,</hi> of <hi>Arimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> and of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> At this very day the moſt zealous among thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledge, that God ſaves many perſons who live under the Schiſmatical Miniſtry of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> although beſides that Schiſm, they accuſe them of holding a multitude of errours and ſuperſtitions. For ſo <hi>Poſſevin</hi> ſets it down in one of his Relations of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> We <note place="margin">Poſſevin in Muſcov.</note> ought not then to make the ſubſiſtance of the Church to depend abſolutely on that Infallibility, whereof we diſpute. We ought yet far leſs to abuſe the promiſes of God, by pretending under that pretext, that they can never do that that is ill. The true uſe of the promiſes, is to encourage us to our Duty, and in ſtead of making us preſumptious, they ought on the contrary to humble us, and to ſhew us the horrour of our ſins when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that promiſe. For ſo the Scripture makes uſe of it in the ſecond Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> upon the ſubject of the Idolatries of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> King of <hi>Judah;</hi> for after having reckoned them over <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.</note> particularly, it adds, <hi>that he ſet up a graven Image of the Grove that he had made in the Houſe of which the Lord had ſaid to</hi> David, <hi>and to</hi> Solomon <hi>his Son, In this Houſe, and in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>which I have choſen out of all the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>will I put my Name for ever.</hi> See there the promiſe employed to its right uſe, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> in what he had done under a pretence, that God had promiſed that his Name ſhould never depart from the Temple, which is the Language they ſpeak in theſe days; but to condemn <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> of that, that as much as it lay in his power he had nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified that promiſe of God. And ſo alſo it is that good men ought to ſpeak to the Corrupters of Religion. God has promiſed us, that he would betroth his Church to himſelf for ever; and you have laboured to break off that happy Marriage. Jeſus Chriſt has promiſed us, that he will be always with us even unto the end of the world, and you have endeavoured to deprive us of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. He has promiſed us that his Holy Spirit ſhall be always with us, and you have greived and drove him away.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Church might err, ſay they yet farther, God would then be unjuſt, in commanding us to keep our ſelves under the Guidance and the Miniſtry of the Church, for that would not be an aſſured means of obtaining ſalvation. <hi>All men know</hi> ſays, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur

                  <hi>bind his creatures to incline to an end without giving them means to come to that end. The Church cannot err, ſince if ſhe did err we ſhould not have any means to come to everlaſting ſalvation, where God would have us come under the conduct of the Church.</hi> But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is not difficult; God would that we ſhould be ſaved under the Conduct of the Church, that is to ſay, of the Paſtors of it, not by giving a blind obedience to all that they tell us, but by a wiſe diſcerning of that which is good, from that which is bad: and that we may make that diſcernment, he has given us his word, to which he will have usbring all that the Paſtors teach, to examine their Doctrine according to that Rule. This is the aſſured means that he has left us for that. If that means is not ſo agreeable to the men of the world, who have other buſineſs to mind, and wont break their brains with the Reading of the Word of God, God will tell them one day, that their greateſt buſineſs was to ſerve him, and to ſave themſelves, and that if they have not ſearched out the true means, they ought only to accuſe their own neglect, and their too great graſping of the things of this world.</p>
               <p>If they yet urge, that that means is neither eaſie nor proper for the meaner ſort; we need but compare it with that of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Infallibility of the Church, and we ſhall quickly ſee that this laſt is infinitely more difficult, and far leſs proper for the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than the other. For without taking notice of the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that there is for them to be aſſured of this Principle that the Latin Church is Infallible, ſuppoſing at the ſame time that it was, where ſhould any Woman or Tradeſman go to ſeek that Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to be perſuaded that that which they believe, and that which they practiſe, is the true Belief, and the true Worſhip of the Church? Will they go to ſeek it in the Practiſes and Cuſtoms of the People? But they all agree that the people may fall into thoſe abuſes and Superſtitions, that the Church does not at all approve of. Will they look for it then from the voice of their Curate, or from that of their Biſhop? But their Curate and their Biſhop may be miſtaken, ſhall it be then from the <hi>Words</hi> of the Pope pronounc'd <hi>ex Cathedra?</hi> But that poor Tradeſman, and that Woman can neither know where to find the Pope, nor what they mean by <hi>ex Cathedra;</hi> ſhall it be then from the Univerſal conſent of the Church and her common cuſtoms? But who ſhall tell them what that Univerſal Conſent is? Muſt thoſe poor people know what they generally hold and prectiſe in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:97749:40"/>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> or that which they generally teach in the Schools? It is then neceſſary for them to learn <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi> But when they ſhall have learnt that, how can they underſtand the true ſence of the Councils, ſince that without going any further the greateſt part of the Canons of that of <hi>Trent</hi> are conceived in general and Ambiguous Terms, which may be explained in divers ſences, and which very thing ſome ſay was done with deſign for the carrying on the different Opinions of the Schools. Moreover, thoſe gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and ambiguous terms, ſomtimes leave the mind undetermined, and the Conſcience in ſuſpence, in matters of practice, where they make it neceſſary to do a thing without ſhewing them after what manner they ſhould do it. For Example, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, <hi>That one ought to give to Images that Worſhip that is due to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Trid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Seſſ.</hi> 25.</note> 
                  <hi>them;</hi> this is the Infallible Voice of the Church, which binds a man to give ſome Worſhip to Images, which if he does not, he fails in doing his Duty. But what that Worſhip is, the Council ſays nothing to. Is it a Negative or a Poſitive Worſhip? Is it that the ſame that they give to thoſe they repreſent, ſhould be communicated to the Image as well as the Original? or is it meant only of ſuch Relative Worſhip that the Image ſhould have no part of it, or if has any part, what is it? Is it ſimply a cuſtomary Worſhip, which conſiſts in making uſe of thoſe repreſentations to excite their Piety, by the remembrance of things paſt? To tell that, the Council ſays nothing. It ſays indeed, that the Worſhip which they give to Images, relates to thoſe they repreſent; but this is not to define of what nature that Worſhip is, for of what kind ſoever it is, one may always ſay it has reference to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. It ſays indeed yet further, that when any Kiſs their Images, when they Bow to them, and Kneel before them, they adore Jeſus Chriſt and the Saints; but thoſe terms denote only an external Worſhip, without determining any thing of a more internal one, and when it ſhould determine of an internal, that Council ſays not a word whether the Image has any part, or what part it has. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which they ought neceſſarily to determine it to ſome internal Worſhip, for of that they treat. How ſhall any man know whether that ſide which he takes in this matter be good or bad, ſince the voice of the Church has abandoned him, and after it has as it were ſet him in the midſt of four ways, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to march on, never ſhews the way that he ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but leaves him in the neceſſity of placing his Devotion at all adventure? They will ſay, that this is to urge things too far as to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97749:41"/>
what relates to Women and Tradeſmen: For thoſe perſons know not what uſe to make of the Infallibility of the Church, but only for certain General Articles, which they cannot doubt of that the Church Teaches. But, not to inſiſt here, that thoſe General Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are themſelves ſubject to form different meanings in the minds of the more ſimple, and that they ought to make their choice with ſome certainty. I ſay, that the Worſhiping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and other ſuch like things is more uſed by ſuch ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than others, and that many of thoſe Devotions are proper to them, about which they cannot have any certainty, nor by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence practiſe them with any Faith. I place in this Rank the Feaſt of the Immaculate Conception of the Bleſſed Virgin, which they ſolenmly celebrate, for who can give them any certainty in that point? Yet nevertheleſs it is a piece of Worſhip, it is a matter of Practice or Duty, whereof they cannot acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a good Conſcience, without being aſſured of that which they do.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In ſine, they make uſe of the Viſibility of the Church, to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Monfeiur le Card. de Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel livr.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 6.</note> prove its Infallibility. The True Church of Jeſus Chriſt, ſays one, ought always to be Viſible, always plainly to be diſcerned, whence it follows that ſhe cannot err; for if it were poſſible for her to do ſo, ſhe could be no longer acknowledged as a True Church, and there would be no more means propoſed to all men for their Salvation. None can be ſaved out of the Communion of the True Church, ſince it is impoſſible for any to be ſaved without Faith, and that according to the Apoſtle none can have Faith without that Preaching which ought to be made by the Miniſters of the Church. The True Church ought then to be always Viſible, to the end that all men ſhould ſet themſelves under its Miniſtry to obtain Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that at leaſt they ſhould be inexcuſable if they did not ſo place themſelves, and by Conſequence it is neceſſary that ſhe ſhould be Infallible. To this Reaſon, which alone makes a long Controverſie, and about which they make very long Chapters, they add ſome paſſages of Scripture, from whence they conclude that the Church is always Viſible, and ſome others that contain in their Opinion, not only the promiſes of a perpetual Viſibility, but of a Viſibility ſhining with ſuch a brightneſs and ſuch ſplendour, that the True Church may be known to Strangers and Infidels to be ſo.</p>
               <p>To Anſwer this Argument of theirs, in the firſt place I ſay, That the True Church may be ſo far from being always diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97749:41"/>
by all men, as they pretend it to be, as that one cannot ſay ſo much as that all men have always been able to know that there has been a Society of Chriſtians in the World; for not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Chriſtian Church, in its Original, then when the Apoſtles were as yet in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or thereabouts, was very little known to the reſt of the world; not to ſay, that the knowledge of that new Society did not ſo ſoon ſpread it ſelf over the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, nor in the bordering Countries, that the moſt of the people were ignorant for ſome time, of what it was to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; it cannot be denyed that many Ages had ſlipt away, before that the moſt conſiderable part of the Earth, as all <hi>America,</hi> could have any knowledge that there were any Chriſtians in the World. How then, can any one ſay the True Church is always Viſible, and always diſcernable to all men? Is it becauſe thoſe <hi>Americans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe laſt Ages were not men, or is it becauſe they were not bound to work out their own Salvation? They ought then in good earneſt to acknowledge that God is moſt free in the diſpenſing of the means of Salvation, which he propoſes to whom he will, and refuſes to whom he will. Till the external Communion with the True Church ſhall be the only means of, and abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, none can conclude that ſhe ought to be perpetually viſible, and diſcernable by all men. For it frequently happens, that God for moſt juſt reaſons, but which we ought not to ſearch out with too great Curioſity, may withdraw from men the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal means of their Salvation, and yet notwithſtanding he does not fail to convince by other ways, which render them inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; worthy of Condemnation. Men are bound to place themſelves in the true Church, then when it is diſcernable to them to be ſo, but when it is not ſo, as it is not at this day to the Southern Nations, we ought not to believe that God will damn them for not having put themſelves into it, they have other crimes enough to be puniſhed for, without making God to violate his Juſtice in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>See here what I ſay for the defending of Gods Juſtice, and to let you ſee the raſhneſs of thoſe Arguments, which ſuppoſe that God is bound to make thoſe Gentlemen Infallible, to the end that he may condemn men with ſome reaſon. But further, I do not deny, that one cannot in ſome ſence ſay, that God has always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſome True Church Viſible upon Earth; but that one ought not to play with thoſe ambiguous Terms, it is neceſſary to make a diſtinction, and to ſhew clearly in what ſence it may, and in what ſence it may not be found to be True. For beſide that that I have
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97749:42"/>
ſaid in the firſt place, That the True Church is not Viſible, nor to be generally known by all, we ought not to imagine that the True Church muſt be always Viſible in one certain place, that is to ſay, that one only People, one Society, one body which has been for time a True Church, may not in the end loſe that quality, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whatſoever manner that comes to paſs, whether it be by an entire forſaking of Chriſtianity, or whether it be by an extreme and general Corruption of that Religion. God has ſometimees taken away his Candleſtick from the midſt of a people, according to that threatning which he made to the Church of <hi>Epheſus. I will come quickly unto thee, and take away thy Candleſtick out of its</hi>

                  <hi>place except thou repent.</hi> The greateſt part of the <hi>African</hi> Churches which heretofore were ſo flouriſhing, are now no longer ſo; and there is not any place upon the Earth, neither <hi>Paris</hi> nor <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> nor <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor <hi>Antioch,</hi> nor <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Avignon,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, nor the <hi>Greek,</hi> nor the <hi>Armenian,</hi> nor the <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> neither the Chair of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> nor that of Saint <hi>James,</hi> nor that of Saint <hi>John,</hi> nor that of Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> that can promiſe it ſelf that it ſhall never periſh. There are no ſuch promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Scripture, and it is a ſpeech very criminal in the Mouth of any Church whatſoever it be, if ſhe ſays, <hi>I ſit a Queen,</hi>

                  <hi>and am no widow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow.</hi> When therefore they ſhall ſay, that God keeps up always a True Church in the World, let them remember, that it is in a way Independant on any Places, and Sees; or if that reſtriction will not pleaſe them, let them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe clear and ſolid and peculiar priviledges to us, which may ſet the <hi>Latin</hi> Church above all its Fellows. For as to that that ſome ſet before us that ſaying of Jeſus Chriſt to S. <hi>Peter, I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not;</hi> it is clear from a plain <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 22.</note> view of that paſſage, that it only regards the perſon of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> with relation to that violent Temptation wherewith he was hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Houſe of the High Prieſt, and under which there wanted but a little of his Faith having wholly periſhed, and that it does not in the leaſt concern his pretended Succeſſours, whereof there is not ſo much as one word in all the Scripture. I ſay the ſame, to that Commandment that Jeſus Chriſt gave him to <hi>Feed his ſheep,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 21.</note> which reſpects only his re-eſtabliſhment in the Office of an Apoſtle after his fall, nor is there any promiſe adjoyned for his Succeſſors, nor for their See, whereof there is not a word mentioned either there, or any where elſe. And as to that paſſage, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church,</hi> &amp;c. Whether they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:97749:42"/>
it of that Confeſſion which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had made, or whether they refer it to his perſon, I ſay that no one can underſtand it of his Succeſſors ſince there is not any mention made of them either directly or indirectly. For when the See of <hi>Rome</hi> was not, when it had never yet been; The Church did not fail of being built upon that Confeſſion of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> comprehended Jeſus Chriſt, upon whom the Church is every way built; but alſo becauſe that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> or Saint <hi>Peter</hi> Confeſſing, was as one of the Chief Stones in that myſtical Building, which is not left alone, for Jeſus Chriſt, who is not only the Foundation, but the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Architect, has added many others in all Ages, and will always joyn others to them till the Building be intirely fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that is to ſay till God fulfilled the Decree of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>But to go on with our Diſcourſe of the Viſibility of the True Church. I affirm in the third place, that we ought to know very well what a True Church Viſible is. For we ought not to imagine that all thoſe perſons who compoſe that Viſible Society, ſhould be that True Church. None but thoſe True Believers; I would ſay, thoſe who joyn to their external Profeſſion of Chriſtianty, a true and ſincere Piety, are really the Church of Jeſus Chriſt, and as for the others, that is to ſay, the worldly, Prophane and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical, they are but the Church in appearance only, and not indeed. For having no inward Calling, which conſiſts in Faith and Love, they do not belong to the Myſtical Body of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, nor are they of his Communion. Notwithſtanding, they do not fail to be mixt with the Faithful by reaſon of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal profeſſion, as if they really were in the ſame Religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with them. What then is the Viſibility of the True Church as to us? It is not that we can diſtinctly, and with any certainty affirm. <hi>Behold theſe be the Truly faithful of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> None but but God alone can know them after that diſtinct manner, and and without a poſſibility of being deceived. But this we may ſay of that Viſible Society, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder that Miniſtry, and in that Communion, God preſerves and raiſes the truly Faithful.</hi> Whence we may from this Judgment with Solidity and Truth, and I may ſay alſo without a poſſibility of being deceived, that there is a True Viſible Church. In that ſence, I declare, that there has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been ſome way or other a True Church Viſible upon Earth, not but that God can make it wholly diſappear to the Eyes of men whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe him to do ſo without doing men any
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97749:43"/>
wrong, or any breach of his promiſes, ſince he has without doubt, extraordinary ways to beget Faith in the hearts of his Children, and to keep them on in that courſe and to lead them in the end unto Salvation, without making uſe either of the publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, or Miniſtry, but only becauſe we ought not to believe that there ever hapned ſince the firſt riſe of Chriſtianity an Eclipſe ſo full and intire, that one could not ſome way ſay, <hi>There is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in which God does keep the truly Faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, after ſome way, For as that Judgment depends on two things, the one to be able to know a Society and a Miniſtry, and the other to know that under that Miniſtry and in that Society a Man may work out his own Salvation, in reſpect of the firſt it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between two ſeaſons, the one of Liberty and Proſperity, where the Church has its Aſſemblies and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes its Miniſtry openly in the face of all the World. For then ſhe is much more viſible then ſhe would be otherwiſe, that is to ſay, it is far more eaſy to be known what Society and what Miniſtry that is. Such was the State of the Church under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and other Chriſtian Emperours; and it is in ſuch times as thoſe that the promiſes of Its outward ſplendour, if there are any ſuch in Scripture, are accompliſhed. The other ſeaſon is that of its Afflictions and Perſecution, ſuch was that of the firſt Century of the Church under the <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperours, and the Enemies of Chriſtianity. For none can deny that then, the Church was leſs diſcernable by its Aſſemblies, not only becauſe they were more private and leſs expoſed to the publick view, but alſo yet further becauſe, the name of Chriſtian had been defamed by a thouſand calumnies, and charged with a thouſand falſe imputations, which made the knowledge of the Church to be far more difficult. And it will be to no purpoſe to ſay, That then the Church was viſible, and illuſtrious by the blood of its Martyrs. For the blood of its Martyrs, did not in the leaſt hinder the accuſing of the Chriſtians of moſt odious crimes, that which hindred its being liable to be eaſily known. Thoſe Accuſations were as a Cloud before the eyes of the Common people, which was neceſſarily to be diſcipated, before they could come to know what Chriſtianity was. So that the True Church is more or leſs Viſible according to the difference of its Seaſons.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond thing, which is to know that one may be ſaved in that Society and under that Miniſtry, it is neceſſary that we diſtinguiſh of the two States or Conditions wherein that Society
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97749:43"/>
may be found. The one is a more pure State, then when the word of God is preached without mixtures of the Doctrines of men when the publick Worſhip is perform'd without ſuperſtitions, and the Sacraments plainly adminiſtred according to their Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inſtitution, and when generally Religion is eſtabliſhed, taught, and obſerved, after the ſame manner wherein Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles left it to the World. In that Condition, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the True Church in very viſible, and very diſcernable; for it is eaſy to behold all the Characters of its Truth, which only conſiſt in its Conformity to that lively, primitive, and natural Image of Chriſtianity, which God has left us in his Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But it is not leſs certain that a Church may fall into a quite contrary Condition, that is to ſay, into a State of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, then when it adds to divine Truths, ſtrange and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Doctrines, when it mingles ſuperſtitions with the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and when in ſtead of a juſt Government, it exerciſes an inſolent and abſolute Dominion over Mens Conſciences, in one word, then when all things appear ſo confuſed and in that diſorder, that one can ſcarce any more ſee any traces of that beautiful and glorious Image of Chriſtianity which I have before ſpoke of, to ſhine forth. In that Condition I affirm that True Church is very hard to be known, for howſoever it were moſt Viſible in quality of a Church, becauſe its Aſſemblies might be much frequented, it would be nevertheleſs leaſt of all ſo, in the quality of a True Church, in that its natural beauty is ſo darkned and its Viſage ſo disfigured, that in judging according to its Appearances, one can but very difficultly ſay that God does yet preſerve ſome Faithful ones in that Communion and under that Miniſtry. But they will ſay, may not a Church fall into that Condition, and yet for all that be a true Church? I anſwer, that a Viſible Society, as I have ſhewn, is not called a true Church, but only with reſpect to thoſe true Believers who are in it, and not with reſpect to the others. When then it comes to paſs, that the party of the Men of the World prevails, and fills that Society with its Corruptions, all that Society taken in the general does not fail as yet to be called a True Church, while their is ſome appearance, how ſmall ſoever it may be, that God does yet keep and hold in it thoſe good men who do not defile their Souls with that Corruption of the wicked. But how can, ſay they yet further, thoſe good men preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the midſt of ſuch a Society? I anſwer, That they may preſerve themſelves there, after that manner, that one may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

himſelf in a contagious Air, where he draws in the Air, becauſe it is neceſſary to his Life, but yet he may keep himſelf as well as he can from that Contagion, by the help of Antidotes. There are two things in a Corrupted Church, the good, and the evil: if a Man can ſeparate that good from the evil, that is to ſay, if he can take the one and keep himſelf from the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling into Hypocriſy, and being bound to do as thoſe who equally take the good and the evil (which he knows not how to do without dividing between God and his Conſcience,) he may be ſaved in a corrupted Communion, and there may not be another more pure. This evidently appears from the Examples of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of <hi>Simeon,</hi> of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the Holy Virgin, and divers other perſons who liv'd in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, when our Saviour came into the World, and who preſerved their Piety though that Church was fallen into the higheſt Corruption under the Miniſtry of the Scribes and Phariſees. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf who reproved the abuſes of thoſe wicked men, and exhorted his diſciples to take heed of their falſe Doctrines, did not fail to live in that Common Society, and to be found in the Temple with them, and after that he had been Crucified by them, his diſciples did not wholly withdraw themſelves from their Communion, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome time, and till they had indiſpenſable reaſons for it. I will ſhew in the Progreſs of this Treatiſe, that it does not from thence follow, that we may at this day abide in the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and that it much leſs follows, that we may return thither by forſaking the Communion of the Proteſtants, under a pretence that we may ſeparate the good from the bad, the pure from what is impure, ſince we can no more do that, then not become wicked, Impoſtures, Hypocritical and Deteſtable before God and Men. But as this is a point that belongs to another Place, it ſhall ſuffice me to have clearly ſhewn in this Chapter, in what manner, and with what diſtinctions it may be ſaid, that there is always a true Viſible Church, and to have made it appear that it no ways fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from thence, that ſhe muſt needs be Infallible, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends that ſhe is.</p>
               <p>After all this it is not difficult to find out the juſt and true ſence of ſome paſſages of Scripture, which they abuſe in this matter of Viſibility. For as to that of the Goſpel whereof we have ſpoken; <hi>Tell it to the Church, and if he will not hear the Church let him be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>unto thee as the Heathens and the Publicans.</hi> It is clear, that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches are treated of there, and that the perſonal differences
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97749:44"/>
which we may have one with another, and the meaning of it is, that the Faithful are bound, when they receive any wrong from their brethren to carry their complaints to the Church, and to refer themſelves to its Judgment. Or, if it is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in thoſe Times, and in thoſe places where there ſhall be Churches eſtabliſhed, to the Judgment of their Guides and Paſtors, who may end thoſe private Quarrels. And if they will infer from thence, that then there muſt be always a Viſible Church, that may be in a Condition to attend to thoſe Reconciliations, this is that that has no colour of Reaſon. For that Command of Jeſus Chriſt obliging the Faithful no further then as it lies in their power, it would be but a very bad arguing, to ſay that he has ſo engaged for that, that he will ſo order it, that there ſhall be perpetually a viſible Aſſembly, to hear Complaints and give Judgments. It is within a little, as if one ſhould ſay, that he was engaged that we ſhould always have wherewithal to Lend, and wherewithal to give Alms, becauſe he has bid us, <hi>to Lend without hoping for any thing again, and to make our ſelves friends of the Mammon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs</hi> Or, that our Kings were bound never to leave va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant the Office of a Conſtable, or that of the Mayor of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, under a pretence that heretofore they order'd their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to acknowledge thoſe Dignities, and to have recourſe to them in certain Affairs. <hi>Tell it to the Church,</hi> then does not in the leaſt ſuppoſe that the True Church ought to be always in ſuch a State, wherein ſhe ſhould have Authority to paſs her Judgments for the determining private Quarrels. And beſides what I have ſaid, Experience contradicts it; for it is moſt true, that during the hotteſt Perſecutions of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperours, where all was laid in deſolation, that it had in many places nothing like a Viſible Tribunal, to which men could eaſily addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves.</p>
               <p>There are ſome other Paſſages that denote the duty of the Paſtors, and in particular of the Apoſtles, as thoſe where they are called, <hi>The Salt of the Earth, the light of the World, a City</hi>

But this is evidently to abuſe the Scriptures, to make them eſtabliſh the perpetual Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the Church, after that meaning wherein they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe paſſages which exhort the Apoſtles, and after them the Miniſters of the Goſpel to acquit themſelves faithfully of their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97749:45"/>
charge, without negligence and wearineſs from the Conſideration of their Calling, and the end to which God had appointed them. For beſides that their Office does not bind them to that of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, which does not ſuppoſe a very ſplendid State of the Church; Beſides, that the ſame does not oblige them to be Martyrs, if they were not ſpecially called to it. Jeſus Chriſt having told them, That when they ſhould be perſecuted in one place, they ſhould fly unto another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides that I ſay, there is ſo great a difference between the duty of the Paſtors of theſe laſt Ages, which are ſo far behind that of the Apoſtles, and that which thoſe Paſtors have actually done, that one caunot know how to draw any conſequence from the one to the other.</p>
               <p>One cannot alſo conclude any thing from ſome Expreſſions of the Antient Prophets, which ſeem to promiſe a great Temporal Proſperity to the Church; no one is ignorant that the Stile of the Prophets may be full of figures and darkned with Vails, that they ought not to be taken Literally unleſs men would be deceiv'd and imitate the Error of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who take them in that manner. For the Prophets are wont to repreſent Spiritual bleſſings under the borrowed Images of Temporal things, and ſo alſo the Spirit of Chriſtianity obliges us to explain that which they ſaid of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and of his Church, and not to delineate its proſperities, and worldly Grandeur which have no relation at all to the nature of the Goſpel. Not that one cannot ſay, that ſome of thoſe Prophecies have been accompliſh'd according to the Letter of them, in the Times of Chriſtian Emperours for then Kings were its nurſing-Fathers, and Queens its nurſing-Mothers. But that one ought not to draw a neceſſary conſequence, from thence either for all Times, or for all Places, and as men are always prone to abuſe Temporal bleſſings; ſuch a worldly Proſperity of the Church would tend but in the end to corrupt it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Authority of the Prelats of the Latin Church had not any right to bind our Fathers to yeild a blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them, or to hinder them from examining their Doctrines.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>HItherto we have not oppoſed in our courſe the Book of Prejudices; not but that the end which he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to himſelf, has a great connexion with the things of which I have treated; but becauſe that Authour has not beleived it neceſſary (to make us renounce the Reformation) to juſtify the Latin Church from thoſe ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders which moved the minds of our Fathers, nor to ſpeak of that priviledge which ſhe pretends that God has given her by making of her Infallible. <hi>We do not pretend,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to prove di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the Authority and Infallibity of the Catholick Chureh. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it would be moſt profitable to do it, and though thoſe among the Catholicks who have taken that method have uſed a moſt juſt and lawful way. Yet as the prepoſſeſſions, wherewith the Calviniſts are full, keep moſt of them from entring upon theſe Principles, howſoever ſolid and true they are; Charity obliges us to try other ways alſo, and that which follows here ſeems one of the moſt natural. It ſuppoſes for a Principle nothing but a Maxim of Common Sence; to wit, That a man who finds himſelf joyned to the Catholick Church by himſelf or by his Anceſtors, ought not to break off from her to joyn himſelf to any other Communion, if he diſcover in that new Communion any ſigns of errour, which may make him judge with reaſon that he ought not to follow it, and that he cannot reaſonably hope that God has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed it, to lead men into the truth.</hi> So it is that he has thought himſelf bound to employ himſelf wholly in that way, to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a great deal of trouble, and that he may in this progreſs load us with a multitude of injuries.</p>
               <p>Yet he muſt excuſe me, if I am not of his mind. The way which he takes is neither juſt nor natural. It is not juſt, becauſe it takes for granted, and indiſputable, thoſe things, which not only are, but are almoſt only to the matters of our Difference. For it ſuppoſes that that Party which would not have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97749:46"/>
and from which our Fathers broke of, was the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; but that is that very thing which is queſtioned, and our Diſpute can never be decided, but by deciding the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. If he will take that advantage of us, that we to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate our ſelves to the cuſtom of the World, ſometimes give thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Name of Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; he cannot be ignorant that thoſe ſorts of Condeſcentions, which only reſpect words cannot infer any conſequence as to things, nor that they can give any ground to make thoſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in this Diſpute, which may be regulated by more ſolid Principles. Further, that way which he would follow, ſuppoſes, that our Fathers in reforming themſelves, made a new Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and that is yet that very thing that is in Queſtion, and we maintain that it cannot be reaſonably called ſo, as it will appear in the Progreſs of this Treatiſe. I ſay alſo, that that courſe is not natural. For before we ſhould come to conſider whether there were not ſigns of errour in our Reformation, the nature of things would firſt let us ſee whether our Fathers had not juſt reaſons ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the ſtate of the Latin Church, to Reform themſelves, and whether it was not poſſible for that Church to corrupt it ſelf. But that could not be well known, but by examining what that State was in the days of our Fathers with that pretence of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility; as we have done.</p>
               <p>But though the Author of thoſe Prejudices has beleived, that he might ſpare himſelf the trouble of proving to us the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Authority of thoſe whom he calls the Catholick-Church, yet he fails not to require us to ſubmit our ſelves to thoſe by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them an abſolute obedience. He would have it that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſo apt to deceive our ſelves in our Judgments, and that the ſearch of true Religion being ſo difficult, that the ſureſt way is for us to <hi>ſee with their Eyes,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to tread in their ſteps, and wholly to ſtrip our ſelves of our own guidance to give it unto them.</hi> So alſo the chief Prieſts and the Scribes ſpake among the Jews; <hi>This</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>People who know not the Law, are curſed.</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt ſaid of theſe alſo. <hi>Let them alone, they be blind leaders of the blind, and both</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall fall into the Ditch.</hi> If the Maxim of that Authour be good he muſt affirm that our Fathers were very unhappy, for having had their eyes to ſee thoſe diſorders which reigned among the Church-men in their days, and that God had highly favoured them; had he made them to have been born ſtupid and blind; for he conceivs it would be ſo far from cauſing them to fall and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97749:46"/>
according to the threatning which Jeſus Chriſt gives to thoſe who leave themſelves to be ſo blindly guided, that it would be on the contrary the only means to go on with any certainty. Howſoever it be, we are not bound to be ſo blind; that before we loſe the uſe of our Eyes, we muſt not examine this Queſtion, whether we ought to loſe them or not. Nature and Grace have given them to us, they would have us to ſurrender them, but let them give us leave to uſe them at the leaſt this one time, to ſearch whether it be juſt that we ſhould deprive our ſelves of them. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelf has forbid us to do it, the Authour of thoſe Prejudices has commanded it. We ought at leaſt to examine which of the two has reaſon on his ſide. That then ſhall be the buſineſs of this Chapter, wherein I propoſe to my ſelf to ſhew, That the Authority of thoſe Prelats who governed the Latin Church in the time of the Reformation, could not be high enough to oblige our Fathers blindly to believe all that they told them, nor to hinder them from examining the Doctrines of thoſe Prelats.</p>
               <p>But as we find it frequently fall out, that they diſguiſe our Sentiments, and that they may render them odious they urge them beyond their due bounds, it will be meet before we go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, preciſely to determine what is Treated of in that Right, to the end that all equitable perſons may the more eaſily judg of it. We do not here treat of the uſe of the Miniſtry in General. We acknowledge that God has appointed it in his Church, and that it would be a raſhneſs very criminal to go about to aboliſh it. The Confeſſion of our Faith, our practice, our Books, and the very writings of our Adverſaries ſufficiently juſtifie us, to make us believe that they will not lay any thing to our charge in that point. We do not here alſo meddle with that order that ought to be obſerved in the Election and Ordination of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, we all agree, that when the ſtate of the Church is regulated, it ought not to be permitted to any that will, to thruſt themſelves into the Miniſtry, nor to encroach upon their Function without being lawfully called, and if there is any difference in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it only regards other queſtions, and not that which we handle at preſent. Nor do we further Treat of that reſpect, or that obedience which every one ows to good and lawful Paſtors. Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth you, rejecteth me:</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the Faithful to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves with all teachableneſs to their conduct. <hi>Obey them that are ſet over you, and ſubmit your ſelves; for they watch for</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:97749:47"/>
                  <hi>your ſouls,</hi> The word then of good Paſtors ought to be received with humility, their Functions to be conſidered with veneration, and their perſons to be loved and honoured, not only in reſpect of their charge, but becauſe they acquit themſelves faithfully in it. We do not yet further concern our ſelves to know, whether one ought not to give that obedience to theſe Miniſters of the Church who preach to us the Word of God, although their lives are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and ſcandalous, and no ways correſpond with their Doctrine. We confeſs, that it is not allowable for perſonal crimes to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our ſelves from them, nor from thoſe who adhere to them, whether they own thoſe crimes, or whether they deny them. We ought to indeavour to reduce them to their duty, and if they are incorrigible, or if they have committed Actions which render them unworthy of their Function, there are ordinary ways that one ought to take to deprive them; if they amend, the ſcandal is repaired, and if they do not either becauſe they will elude by Artifices the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, or becauſe that depravation may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo general that there ſhall be no more puniſhment of vice; then we may pray God that he would ſend more faithful Labourers into his Harveſt, nay we ought to do it, but we ought always to own thoſe for Paſtors, who are in that Charge, and to receive the Word of God from their Mouths, while they Preach it purely. I go yet further, and I ſay that we ought always in General, to think well of thoſe Paſtors, and not lightly to entertain ſuſpicions of their goodneſs and faithfulneſs, eſpecially when we ſpeak of the whole Body, and the diſorder that appears to be great and very viſible therein, that we are not abſolutely to form a juſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt their Miniſtry. This is what we acknowledge and our fathers acknowledged as well as we.</p>
               <p>But if they will not be contented with that, if they will have it yet farther, that the faithful are bound blindly to receive the Doctrines of their Paſtors, without having any right to examine their Nature or their Quality, and that it would be a crime but to ſet upon that examination; if they would, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Paſtors, after whatſoever manner we conſider it, whether ſeparatly or conjunctly, or altogether, or in the greater number, ſhould be without any bounds or meaſures, as to matters of Faith, or Worſhip and the general Rules of Manners, and that, though they ceaſe to believe the Divine Faith, and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe all that which they ſay, without informing our ſelves any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: This is a Maxim we deny, and which we maintain is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97749:47"/>
to the Word of God, to right reaſon, and the true intereſt of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To begin with the Word of God, we may ſay, That there never was any Maxim in the World, againſt which it does more expreſly declare it ſelf. For, firſt it abſolutely forbids Lordſhip in Paſtors. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles,</hi> ſaid Jeſus Chriſt in that paſſage before alledged, <hi>exerciſe Lordſhip over them, and thoſe that</hi>

But it ſhall not be ſo with you, but he that is great among you, let him be as the leſs, and he that is chief as he that doth ſerve.</hi> In the ſame ſence Saint <hi>Peter</hi> bids them, <hi>Feed the flock of Jeſus Chriſt, taking the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight</hi>

                  <hi>your Faith, but are helpers of your joy.</hi> We may obſerve, that on purpoſe to hinder the introducing that Dominion into the Church under the name of Inſtruction, as they have done in theſe laſt Ages, Jeſus Chriſt goes ſo far as to forbid his Diſciples the name of Maſters. <hi>Be not ye,</hi> ſays he, <hi>called Rabbi, for one is your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>

For what likelyhood is there that God would have filled his Scriptures with ſo many things contrary to this Dominion, if he had had a deſign to inveſt the Paſtors of his Church with an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſo abſolute over mens Conſciences, and of making them
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97749:48"/>
Soveraign Lords of their Faith? Is not that Authority, after the way they pretend to it, a real Empire, and a much more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Empire than the Temporal ones, which they ſet up over the Hearts and Souls of men, where the others do but eſtabliſh theirs over their bodies? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Du Perron</hi> buſie themſelves very <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bell. de Rom. Pont. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> much in eluding the force of that paſſage where Jeſus Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids his Diſciples that Dominion. They ſay, that he forbids not Dominion, but the manner of that Dominion, that is to ſay, that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Du Perron. Repl. Liv.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 56.</note> he would not have them affect that Dominion, nor that they ſhould Rule Tyrannically or with violence, but that nevertheleſs he would have them Rule. Who ſees not the abſurdity of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer? For when Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Lordſhip, but it ſhall not be ſo with you,</hi> it is clear that the diſtinction that he makes between Kings and Paſtors, falls upon that Dominion, and not upon the manner of that Dominion. I confeſs, that he forbids the affectation of that Dominion, but, I affirm, that he forbids alſo that Dominion it ſelf, as it appears from his words, for he ſays not, the Kings of the Gentiles affect Dominion, but he ſays, they do exerciſe that Dominion, and that it ſhall not be ſo with them, which ſhews he would diſtinctly ſay, that they ſhould not exerciſe Lordſhip. Elſe it was neceſſary that in thoſe words Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have ſet down ſome difference between the Government of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations, and that of his Church. But that difference cannot conſiſt in this, that they ought not to affect the manner of Dominion in his Church, for that would make him ſay, that they ought, or might lawfully affect it in the Civil Government, which yet is not true. And as to what they ſay of a Tyrannical and violent Domination, they evidently deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For the conteſt of his Diſciples was no ways about that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Dominion, nor about the gentleneſs of that Dominion, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Dominion it ſelf, they ſtrove among themſelves which of them ſhould be greateſt. Whence it follows that Jeſus Chriſt, who anſwers to their thoughts, ſpeaks of a Dominion whatſoever it be, and not ſimply of a Tyrannical one. To which I add, that thoſe other Paſſages to which they know not how to apply thoſe evaſions, learly determine the ſence of that ſaying of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the Scripture is not contented only to forbid that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and Abſolute Authority to the Miniſters of the Church, it farther gives the Faithful a right to examine that which they teach, and at the ſame time obliges them to do it, to ſeparate the Good from the Bad. Hence it is that Jeſus Chriſt, who would have his

Who ſees not that that exaggeration which he uſes, ſerves but to let us ſee the importance, the neceſſity, the force of that obligation which he would lay upon us, and how inviolable and indiſpenſable it is? He commands us not only to make a ſincere diſcernment, he does not only ſpeak of a ſimple rejecting of that that ſhall be Forreign and Alien to it, and ſhall not agree with the Goſpel; He enjoyns an Anathema, an Execration; He would not only have us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it againſt men indefinitely, or againſt thoſe whom the Councils and the Popes ſhall declare Hereticks, he declares that it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97749:49"/>
ought to be pronounced againſt an Apoſtle, againſt himſelf the moſt famous among the Apoſtles, againſt him who had had Viſions and Revelations, who had been caught up into the third Heaven, and who had laboured with ſuch an abundant expence of his blood, and of his Life for Jeſus Chriſt. This is not all yet, he enjoyns the ſame againſt an Angel from Heaven, if he undertook to Preach another Goſpel than that which he has Preached unto us. What can be ſaid, more weighty? What is there in the Church beyond an Anathema? What is there upon Earth among men greater than Saint <hi>Paul!</hi> What is there in Heaven above an Angel? And ſhall the ordinary Paſtors, the Prelates, Patriarchs, Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils be exempted from that Rule, when the Apoſtles and Angels themſelves are not?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But we muſt go yet higher, and follow the Scripture yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It teaches us that God has put his Sacred Writings imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into the hands of all the Faithful, as well as into thoſe of the Paſtors, with an obligation to read them exactly, and to build their Faith and their Hope upon them, whence it follows that they have right to refer the Doctrines of their Paſtors, and to examine them by that Rule, and that they are not bound <hi>To ſee with the Eyes of the Prelates, nor to deveſt themſelves of their own guidance to reſt themſelves upon that of their Prelates.</hi> The Proof of this Truth may appear from a thouſand places of Scripture. When God would give his Law to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther me the people together, that I may make them hear my words, that</hi>

                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>in that from a child he had known the holy Scriptures.</hi> See then the Old Law, the Antient Scriptures given immediately into the hands of all the Faithful, with a command to Read them, and meditate upon them, and conſequently, to build immediately upon them their Faith, their Piety, and their Comfort. But becauſe we ſhould not imagine that that Order has been changed under the New Teſtament, we need but to run through the firſt Verſes of the greater part of the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and thoſe of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> of Saint <hi>James,</hi> of Saint <hi>Jude,</hi> and they will ſee that they are addreſt to the Faithful of the Churches, as well as to the Paſtors. <hi>To all that be in</hi> Rome, <hi>called to be Saints. To the Saints and Faithful in Jeſus Chriſt which are at</hi> Epheſus. <hi>To all the Saints in Chriſt Jeſus which are at</hi> Philippi; where he diſtinguiſhes them from the Paſtors, for he adds, <hi>with the Biſhops and Deacons.</hi> All that lets us ſee clearly that there was nothing changed in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. They will ſay it may be that it does not follow from thence that the more ſimple among the Faithful ſhould take to themſelves that liberty of ſearching out by themſelves the true meaning of the Scriptures, and that they ought not to refer themſelves to their Paſtors who are the Interpreters of them. But if that were ſo, why ſhould he have addreſt them immediately to them, why ſhould he have put them in their hands, with commands to Read them, to Learn them, and to Mediate of them in their Houſes, in their Journeys, in their riſing Up, and lying Down? why ſhould he have ſaid that it was all their Wiſdom, and all their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, if he had not ſuppoſed that they could of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves comprehend the meaning of them, at leaſt of ſo much as might be ſufficient for their particular Comfort, and for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Moreover, that is clearly refuted by the Uſe that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles would have us make of the Scripture, that we might know him to be the true Meſſiah, notwithſtanding the contradictions of the ordinary Paſtors of that Church, who gave to that Scripture a quite contrary meaning. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi>

                  <hi>and they are they which teſtifie of me.</hi> To what purpoſe ſhould he have ſaid that, if he would not have them by themſelves ſearch out the true ſence of the Scripture, and that they ſhould correct the falſe Interpretations which their ordinary Paſtors gave of it. It is from this Principle that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> proved Jeſus Chriſt to be the Meſſiah, not of the Scriptures, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the people, as it may appear by their Sermons. And it is alſo upon this Foundation, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Berea</hi> are praiſed for having made uſe of that Right, and for having by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had recourſe to the Scripture, to know whether that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> told them, was true: <hi>Theſe were,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Luke, more noble than thoſe</hi> Jews <hi>in</hi> Theſſalonica, <hi>in that they received</hi>

                  <hi>the word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo.</hi> After that, how can any one affirm, that the Faithful ought blindly to believe their Paſtors, and to ſtrip themſelves of their own conduct, to reſt themſelves upon that of the Prelates? Is not this to condemn that which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture praiſes? If you look on thoſe of <hi>Berea</hi> as being yet <hi>Jews,</hi> had they not their ordinary Paſtors who had before condemned Jeſus Chriſt, and all his Doctrine? Wherefore then had they recourſe to the Scriptures? Could they better comprehend the ſence of them, than all the Church, to which they had ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a Church, I ſay, which was upheld by all the Authority of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the Sacred Names of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> by the glory of a thouſand Miracles, by the ſending of the Prophets, by the Holineſs of a Temple where God had placed his Name for ever, and by the Majeſty of a Succeſſion that had been preſerved for near twenty Ages? And if you look upon them as new made Chriſtians, were not <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> their True Paſtors, whom their Zeal, their Conſtancy, their Travels, their Preaching, their Knowledg, and their Miracles had made famous every where?

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is an amazing thing to behold a prejudice and a preſent Intereſt, ſo far to blind thoſe, who ſet before us this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Obedience to the Governours of the Church, and who would have the Faithful ſtrip themſelves intirely of the care of their Souls, to place it in their Paſtors hands, that they ſhould not have conſidered, that it is the moſt pernitious Maxim in the World, the moſt contrary to the Glory of God, to the Intereſts of his Juſtice, and his ſervice, to the ſubſiſtence of his true Church. They will themſelves I hope be perſwaded of it, if they will but make with me theſe following Reflexions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, That by that Principle they juſtify the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they adhered to that falſe worſhip brought into their Church by the Authority of their Ordinary Paſtors, or practiſed with their conſent and approbation, which fell out <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings</hi> 14.</note> very often, as we have before noted, and as it appears from the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament. The people in that Story, were not in the leaſt culpable either for ſacrificing upon the high places, or in the Groves, as they had began to do under the Reign of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> nor for having of Images, or as the Scripture ſpeaks <hi>carved Idols,</hi> nor in offering up incenſe to the Brazen Serpent, as they did even down to the reign of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> ſince in doing all thoſe things they did but follow their Prieſts, and could ſay that they referred themſelves to them to ſee for them, according to what they were bound. They were not to be blamed then, when under <note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 16.</note> the reign of <hi>Ahaz</hi> they offered their oblations on a ſtrange Altar, made after the manner of that of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> ſince it was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the Prieſt that ordered it, and ſet it up in the place of the Altar of God, to the end that the people ſhould there offer up their Devotions. They were not in the leaſt to be blamed in thoſe days wherein their Prophets charged their Prieſts and ordinary Paſtors with having ſinned againſt God and propheſied by <hi>Baal,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2.</note> and ſaying to a ſtock, Thou art my Father, and to a ſtone, Thou art my Mother, and by that means to have corrupted the people
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97749:51"/>
of God. For what could thoſe people do more then follow their Paſtors, if it were true, <hi>that we ought to ſee with their eyes, and to tread always in their ſteps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But if by eſtabliſhing that Principle, they juſtify a People in their Idolatry and Violation of the Law of their God, if they acquit them of all fault in that reſpect, it is not leſs certain, that at the ſame time they condemn God for Injuſtice, in having ſent his chaſtiſements upon an innocent people, who had done nothing but what they were bound to do, in following their guides, in that he was not ſatisfied with puniſhing only the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of thoſe Crimes, I mean, thoſe Guides who only were culpable. For why ſhould he puniſh thoſe who ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their guides, whom they could do no otherwiſe, then obey? They condemn all the Complaints of the Prophets, which they addreſt immediately to the People, and all the Threatnings, and ſtinging Cenſures with which their writings are full. For to what purpoſe ſhould they complain, cenſure and threaten with ſo much Exaggeration and vehemency, if the people ought not by themſelves to examine the points of Religion, and that they ought on the contrary to commit themſelves only into their Paſtours hands? They condemn all thoſe holy men, who did not adhere to their Errors, and Profanations; and they muſt ſee themſelves reduced to the neceſſity of condemning them of raſhneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, for having been willing to make uſe of their own Eyes, and not to refer themſelves wholly to the conduct of their Church. They condemn all thoſe in that Church who have firſt ſpoke of a Reformation, and all thoſe who have followed them in it. For thoſe who would not ſee but by the Eyes of the Church, would never have a Tongue to ſpeak any thing againſt its preſent State, nor ears to hear any thing that could be ſaid upon that ſubject. So thoſe good Kings, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who ſet up the true worſhip of God, and did pull down Idolatry, would have been no other but raſh perſons, who had Executed that which they ſhould not have ſo much as undertaken.</p>
               <p>What can they anſwer to that? Will they ſay that all thoſe Reformers wrought miracles, to Authoriſe their Calls? But that is not true. For neither <hi>Hezekiah</hi> nor <hi>Joſiah,</hi> nor thoſe other Kings who aboliſhed thoſe Superſtitions, and Errors, did any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; for that, they had recourſe to nothing but the Law of God. Will they ſay, that they were the <hi>Eccleſiaſties</hi> themſelves who laboured in thoſe Reformations? I confeſs it. But that alone
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97749:51"/>
lets us ſee, that they had done ill in referring themſelves meerly to their Authority, ſince they themſelves had comdemned what they had before approved of, and by their change and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, they acknowledged they had done ill, whence it may follow, that the people had done ill alſo in repoſing their truſt in in them. Will they ſay, that the True Worſhip of God having been of primitive Inſtitution, and by conſequence the firſt Church having been pure, the people would have done ill, if when a change ſhould have happened, they had not abode with, and ſtuck to their firſt Paſtors; and that by that means of rendring to the Church that ſubmiſſion which they owed to it, they would have hindred its Corruption. But to aſſert that, is but to affirm well nigh what we would have. When the Latin Church began to corrupt it ſelf, the people ought to have ſet themſelves in Oppoſition to it, in ſticking cloſe inviolably to their firſt guides, and if they had done ſo, they had not needed ever to have ſpoke of a Reformation. Notwithſtanding, the have not done ſo, and the <hi>Jews</hi> likewiſe had not done ſo, they have not failed of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after that inclination which all men have to do ill. <hi>The Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>City became an Harlot, its ſilver was turned into droſs, and its Wine was mixt with Water,</hi> as one Prophet reproaches them. What ought they to have done in that Miſery, muſt they have remained in that State, under pretence of no <hi>more ſeeing, then by the eyes of the Church of walking only in its Steps, and of deveſting themſelves of their own conduct to reſt upon that of the Church?</hi> No certainly, whatſoever the Author of thoſe Prejudices ſays. They ought on the contrary to have re-aſcended up to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, to the firſt Inſtitution of their Religion, to have ruled themſelves by that, and to have laboured to ſave the preſent Church from that ruin where into its Corrupters would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated her. That had been the duty of all good men, and a contrary ſentiment would have been criminal. But all that lets us diſtinctly ſee how falſe and pernitious that Maxime of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Prejudices is.</p>
               <p>Will they ſay, to defend themſelves, that their is a very great difference between the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Viſible Church, and the Chriſtian, that this has its Rights, Priviledges and Promiſes which the other had not. For ſhe has a Soveraign Authority over the Faith of her Children, a priviledge, that ſhe can never err, and promiſes of a perpetual viſibility? But to come to that, they ought firſt to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97749:52"/>
renounce all thoſe general proofs upon which they found that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Obedience to the Latin Church. They need ſay no more as the Author of the Prejudices has done, that, <hi>the darkneſs of our minds, our perſonal Prejudices, the uncertainty wherein we are of being deceived in our Judgments, the being overwhelmed with a thouſand cares, and a thouſand Temporal neceſſities which almoſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In the Preface.</note> 
                  <hi>wholly take us up, and which will not allow us to give more then a very little Time to the Examining the Truths of Religion, the want of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary helps, the ignorance, narrow and limited underſtandings of the greateſt part of mankind, conſtrain us, to refer our ſelves to the Church.</hi> All that would be to no purpoſe, if they reſtrain it to a priviledge of the Chriſtian Church. For theſe very ſame general reaſons had place in the time of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, men ſaw not then more clearly then they do in theſe days, they were not more aſſured in their Judgments, they were not leſs cumbred with worldly affairs, they were not leſs unprovided of neceſſary helps for the Examination of the Truths of Religion, they were not then leſs ignorant, and their minds leſs narrow, then men are now in theſe days, and yet notwithſtanding, all that did not make it their duty blindly to follow their Paſtors, or Ordinary Guides. Theſe are then nothing but ſhadows, and frivolous pretences, which having been of no force then, cannot have any weight now. We need not further ſay, as the Author of Prejudices has done, <note place="margin">In the Preface.</note> 
                  <hi>That it is certain that God can ſave men, and even the moſt ignorant and ſimple. That yet he does not offer them any other way to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then that of the True Religion. That it is therefore neceſſary that that ſhould be not only poſſible, but eaſy to be known; that yet notwithſtanding it is clear, that there is no way more difficult, more dangerous, and leſs fitted to all capacities then that of examining all its Tenets.</hi> One may equally apply all thoſe propoſitions to the Times of the Old Teſtament, as well as to thoſe of the New. God could ſave men there. He made no other way to Salvation then that of the True Religion. That ought then to have been eaſily known, and that way of Examination was not leſs danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor more fitted to all ſorts of capacities, then it is now. Notwithſtanding all that had not any force to hinder the Faithful from Examining it. They cannot then in theſe days draw any conſequence from what they ſo propoſe. I affirm the ſame thing of all thoſe other inconveniences which they invent to take away from every one that right of Examining the State of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the Scripture, and not wholly to believe their Paſtors, as,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97749:52"/>
that it would be to introduce a Principle of Schiſm and Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that every one might make himſelf a Judge of the Church, that every one might make a Religion according to his Fancy, that it is a great raſhneſs for private Perſons to imagine that they have more Underſtanding and more Wiſdom than the whole Church, and other ſuch like things. They may ſee that all thoſe arguings are brought in vainly and to no purpoſe; for if they were good and ſolid, being ſo general as they are, they would ſerve for all Times and all Places, and would have their Force in favour of the Jewiſh Church, as well as they would have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in Favour of the Latin.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, thoſe Rights, Priviledges, and Promiſes which they would aſcribe to the Chriſtian Viſible Church, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Jewiſh are evidently null, if they would make them depend preciſely on Chriſtianity. For as I have before noted, the Greek Church, the <hi>Armenian,</hi> the <hi>Neſtorian,</hi> and <hi>Aethiopian</hi> might pretend to them as juſtly as the Latin, and yet, the Latin applies them to her ſelf in particular, to the prejudice of all the others. They ought then either to ſhew us what reaſon ſhe has to appropriate thoſe Rights, Priviledges, and general Promiſes, and to make that, that regards the Body of the Univerſal Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come particular to her; or it is neceſſary they ſhew us that indeed they are not thoſe Rights, Priviledges, and Promiſes that are common to all Chriſtian Societies, and that they are peculiar to the Latin Church. But they know not how to do either the one or the other. For neither Nature nor Grace have given any of thoſe Priviledges or Rights to the Latins, in excluſion from all other Chriſtians. They are neither more Lords of our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor more Infallible than others. Chriſtianity is Uniform throughout. The Scripture alſo does not contain any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular promiſe for them. On the contrary, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>That in Jeſus Chriſt there is neither</hi> Jew <hi>nor</hi> Greek, <hi>nor</hi> Barbarian, <hi>nor</hi> Scythian, <hi>nor Bond nor Free, but Chriſt is all and in all.</hi> So that the Latin Church has no reaſon to draw that to her ſelf which is a common Right, nor to pretend any peculiar Priviledges.</p>
               <p>But, in the ſumm of all, we have made it appear in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters that thoſe pretended Priviledges of Infallibility which they aſcribe to the Chriſtian Church Viſible, and thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of perpetual Viſibility, in that Sence of Viſibility wherein they underſtand it, are <hi>Chimaeras</hi> which have not any Foundation either in Scripture or Reaſon. And as to that right of Soveraign-Authority,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97749:53"/>
it cannot here be alledged but to very ill purpoſe. For it is that which is yet in Diſpute, and whereof we have ſhewn the falſity from the example of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. But they may draw from that example a conſequence againſt the <hi>Latin</hi> one, becauſe that if that pretence would have been heretofore pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deſtructive to Religion and the true Church, as they may ſee it would have been, it follows that it will be ſo yet in theſe days. If then they cannot ſet before us any other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two Terms, and thoſe two Churches, which hinders my Concluſion, the Argument will hold intire; for it will not be enough to overthrow it, meerly to ſay, that the Chriſtian Church has that Authority, and that the Jewiſh had it not, but they ought to give us a reaſon for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But to proceed with our Reflexions, If that Maxim where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we treat, were true, that is to ſay, if men were bound to give to their ordinary Paſtors a blind obedience in the matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>to ſee with their Eyes, to tread in their Steps, and to deveſt themſelves of their own conduct to reſt upon theirs,</hi> the Jews who rejected Jeſus Chriſt and his Doctrine, during the time of his Preaching, thoſe who demanded of <hi>Pilate</hi> his Death by crying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, <hi>away with him, away with him, Crucify him,</hi> and thoſe in fine who rejected the word of his Apoſtles, and who inſtead of being converted by them, perſecuted them, would be ſufficiently juſtified in their bold unbeleif, and that deteſtable Parricide which they committed on the Perſon of the Son of God. For what were all thoſe things but juſt conſequences of that Principle? They would not hearken to the Cenſures that Jeſus Chriſt made of the Traditions and Doctrine of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> their Church admitted thoſe Traditions. They would not believe that Jeſus was the true <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> their Church had determined that whoſoever did believe it ſhould be caſt out of their Synagogues. They rejected the Proofs that he gave them from the Scripture; it was not for them to judge of the true meaning of the Scripture, and the Church underſtood it otherwiſe. They demanded that he might be Crucified; the Church had condemned him for a Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, as an Enemy to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Law; it was not for them to inform themſelves any farther. They rejected his Miracles; the Church did ſo too, and ſaid, that he caſt out Devils by the power of <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> They would not hearken to his Apoſtles, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church forbad them. Hitherto their conduct is within due Rules, ſuppoſing that the Principle of the Author of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97749:53"/>
prejudices, might be juſt and lawful, and thoſe miſerable People are very much obliged to him for furniſhing them with arms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to defend themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Maxim of the Author of thoſe Prejudices, draws yet far greater abſurdities after it. It miniſters accuſations againſt Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, againſt his Apoſtles and all thoſe who were converted by their Words. If the Faithful, by thoſe Laws of their ſubmiſſion to the Church, ought not to have any other Eyes than hers, why did Jeſus Chriſt preſent himſelf immediatly to the People, when he ſhould firſt of all have made known his call from Heaven the Glory of his Perſon, and the Dignity of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Church, to have made them own it by proving it to them before he Preach't to the People? He was they will ſay her Lord, and the Church her ſelf would have had no Authority but by him; that is true; But if the People owed the Church an abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, they would have owed it all that time that the Lord would have remained unknown. He ought then to have began to make himſelf known to her, and to have opened her Eyes, that he might at the ſame time have opened thoſe of all the People. If Jeſus Chriſt had been known to have been indeed what he was there is no doubt to be made, but that he would alone have been heard without any dependance on the Church, of which he is the Soveraign Lord; but as yet he was not, and till that knowledge had obtained, the People would have been always bound, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Principle of the Author of Prejudices, not to have ſeen but by the Eyes of the Church to which God had ſubjected them. To ſpeak then home to this Queſtion, whether Jeſus Chriſt was the Son of God, the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or whether he was not, the Faithful being bound to believe nothing but what the Church ſhould tell them, he could not but have addreſt himſelf to her, and not to the Faithful People immediatly. Nevertheleſs, it is moſt true that he addreſſed himſelf neither to the Prieſts, nor to the Scribes, nor to the Phariſees, nor to the Doctors, he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Goſpel to the ſimple People, out of them he took his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and it was among them that he did almoſt all his Miracles, in fine he himſelf gives <hi>thanks to his Father for that he had hid his Myſteries from the Wiſe and Prudent, and had revealed them unto</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Babes.</hi> Whence could ſuch a conduct proceed ſo contrary to that Soveraign Authority, wherewith at this day they would inveſt the Church, that is the Paſtors, in reſpect of the Lay-men? It is not difficult to underſtand, that it was becauſe Jeſus Chriſt did
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97749:54"/>
no ways act from that Principle, nor owned it for a good one; for if he had owned it, he had never ſuffered the People to have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it, he had made uſe of another way to make himſelf known to them, and he would have employed the Miniſtry of the Church for that end.</p>
               <p n="5">5. One may ſee the ſame thing of the Apoſtles, if the People ought entirely to refer themſelves to the Church, in matters of Faith and Religion. Why did the Apoſtles ſollicit the Jews to embrace their Doctrine, when they could not ſo much as hear them without being criminal? They will ſay they had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment from their Maſter to Preach this Goſpel; I confeſs it, but the Jews lived under a Church that had openly declared it ſelf againſt their Preaching, and they might tell them according to the Maxim of thoſe Gentlemen, It is vain that you Preach to us, that you work Miracles, that you alledge the Scriptures; <hi>We ſee by the Eyes of the Church, we hear by her Ears, we march after her Steps, and we deveſt our ſelves of our own guidance to reſt our ſelves upon hers;</hi> This is our Duty, and the Law that is impoſed on us, why do you go about to tempt us to violate it? Suppoſe we that a Jew after having heard one of thoſe Divine and admirable Sermons of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have addreſt himſelf to him, and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him what Authority he pretended to give to that new Chriſtian Church which he took ſuch care to eſtabliſh, whether he did not mean that its Children ſhould render a blind Obedience to it, and that they ſhould refer themſelves wholly to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors for deciding matters of Faith, without intermedling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſearch out the true ſence of the Scripture? Suppoſe yet, that that great Apoſtle ſhould have anſwered him according to <note place="margin">In the Preface of that prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> that Maxim of the Author of Prejudices; <hi>That it was true that the darkneſs of our underſtandings, and our prejudices, might be able to hinder us from ſeeing in the Scriptures thoſe Truths that are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained in them, that a man could not aſſure himſelf that he was not of the number of thoſe who deceived themſelves. That that doubt is terrible, but that which yet infinitely heightens that dread which it muſt needs cauſe, is, that men are neceſſarily bound to chuſe their Party, and to make ſo weighty a choice (to wit of that Religion that they ought to follow) amidſt the cumbrances of a thouſand cares, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worldly neceſſities that almoſt wholly take them up, and that will allow them but a very little time to examine the Truths of that Religion. That the greateſt part of Mankind wanted neceſſary helps, that the half of Chriſtians could not tell how to read, that others did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:97749:54"/>
                  <hi>any Language but their own, that others had ſo narrow and limited a Capacity, that they could but very difficultly conceive the moſt eaſie things. In fine, that there was no way more dangerous, more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and leſs fitted to all ſorts of Capacities then that of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar examination of its Tenets. That the cutting off of that way, led of it ſelf to that of the Authority of the Church, ſince every man is bound to know the truth of ſomething, and he that could not learn by himſelf, muſt neceſſarily learn it of another. They will then have no reaſon to doubt whether they ſhall take the Catholick Church for their Guide, and borrow its Eyes to diſcern the Truths of the Faith, and they will believe themſelves a thouſand times more aſſured in following that, than if they were left to the weak ef-forts of their own Reaſon.</hi> Tell me I pray, whether that diſcourſe would have been very proper for the Converſion of that Jew? and whether he might not juſtly have anſwered, That he was alſo uncertain whether he ſhould not deceive himſelf, and take the wrong ſide, from the very ſame Reaſons that he had alledged; from whence he might as well conclude that he was bound to yeild himſelf to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Jewiſh Church, <hi>which had been the moſt eminent one that was ever in the World; becauſe that although it had Sects among it who diſputed the Truth of its Tenets, yet it had nothing that could make that high Authority which aroſe from external ſigns, to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with any colourable pretence.</hi> To ſpeak in the ſame Language that the Author of Prejudices uſes, <hi>That he ſought then to take her for his Guide, and to believe himſelf a thouſand times more aſſured in following her, than if he had been left to the weak ef-forts of his own Reaſon.</hi> Furthermore, he might think it very ſtrange that the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould go about to violate, in reſpect of the Jewiſh Church, a Principle, which in the end they had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to eſtabliſh for the preſervation of their own, that they ſhould then plead for that Maxim, that every one ought to examine the Tenets of the Faith, and ſearch out the true Religion by himſelf, without abſolutely truſting to his ordinary Paſtors, ſince that they would have them to hear them, notwithſtanding the condemnation that their Church had pronounced againſt them. But that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they ſhould quickly change that Maxim towards thoſe whom they ſhould have converted, and have bound them to have depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded blindly on their Guides. That Inequality would not have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared fair. Tell me I pray yet once more, whether the Jew had not had ſome Reaſon of his ſide? and whether that Maxim of the Authour of Prejudices is not far more deſtructive of the Intereſts
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97749:55"/>
of Chriſtianity than can be eaſily conceived? It opens a Gate to the <hi>Jews</hi> to defend their Unbelief, to juſtify all their bold attempts, and to calumniate Jeſus Chriſt himſelf and his bleſſed Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="6">6. What might not thoſe unbelievers have ſaid againſt thoſe who were Converted? They might have treated them as raſh, preſumptuous, as Rebels and Schiſmaticks, as diſturbers of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as a ſort of men of a private ſpirit, who would make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Judges of the Church, and deſpoil it of its lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to inveſt themſelves in it. But that which is moſt ſcandalous, is, that as that Principle which we oppoſe opens the mouths of the Enemies of the Goſpel, ſo it ſhuts up thoſe of the new Chriſtians, and deprives them of the means of juſtifying themſelves. For what could they have ſaid, to which thoſe others might not immediately have repli'd by the meer application of that Principle? Could they have ſaid that they had known out of the Scripture, out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, that Jeſus was the true <hi>Meſſiah?</hi> But they might have anſwered them, that it belonged to the Church and not to them to judge of the true meaning of the Scripture. Could they have ſaid that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles had an extraordinary Call? But they might have told them alſo, That it was not for private men to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe who ſaid they were extraordinarily ſent, were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that that would be to give way to impoſtors, that the Church ought to make that diſcernment, and that ſhe had loudly declared that they were no other then ſuch. Could they have alleadged the Miracles of Jeſus and his Apoſtles? But they might have given them the very ſame for an anſwer, that ſeeing there were true and falſe miracles, it was not for the common people who ow'd an abſolute obedience to their Guides, to undertake to diſcern between them, but for the Church, which had then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained them, when ſhe ſaid <hi>that Jeſus caſt out Devils by the Prince of Devils.</hi> Could they have complained of the Diſorders and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark</hi> 3.</note> Corruptions that then reigned in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church? But they might have told them, That they were ingrateful and unnatural Children, who lifted themſelves up againſt their Mother, and thought of nothing elſe but diſhonouring her, and that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might ſay, they ought to borrow her eyes, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Truths of the Faith, and to reſt aſſured in following of her. In fine, that Principle ſeems to do nothing elſe but to give a compleat Victory to <hi>Judaiſm</hi> over Chriſtianity.</p>

                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:97749:55"/>
7. But there is more in it yet; for the Heathens might ſo have prevailed againſt the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, and have ſtopt its Progreſs. I confeſs that the Heathens did not call their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Society by the name of the Church. But what does the Name ſignify? Were they not all united in one Religious Society? Had they not all their Guides, their Prieſts, thoſe that offered up their Sacrifices, and their high Prieſts? Put into their hands then that Maxim of the Author of Prejudices, with the grounds upon which it is eſtabliſhed, the obſcurity of mens underſtandings, that doubt of being deceived, the cumbrance of worldly affairs, the want of neceſſary helps, and all thoſe other pretences which they propoſe to us to make us blindly follow their conduct, and it will work the ſame effect as it did in the hands of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Heathens</hi> would not have failed to have made uſe of it, for the hindring their hearkning to thoſe Preachers, to juſtify that obſtinacy with which they reſiſted the Goſpel, to elude thoſe Miracles, to condemn the Apoſtles themſelves and thoſe who had been converted by hearing them, as a ſort of men who had broken that Order, which they themſelves acknowledg'd ſo neceſſary to be kept. They might very well have told them, You have not the True Religion, you are not that Church to which we ought to give an abſolute ſubmiſſion, we have a Heavenly and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Call, and we prove it by Miracles. The <hi>Heathens</hi> might have anſwered them, out of the Inſtructions of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of theſe Prejudices, All thoſe things are in queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Guides and yours, we cannot of our ſelves decide them, <hi>the darkneſs of our underſtandings, the little aſſurance we can have that we are not deceiv'd, the juſt fear that that doubt muſt infer, the cumbrance of a thouſand cares will not allow us to give more then a very little time for the examining the Truths of Religion; all that hinders us from hearkning to you, and makes us to cleave inviolably to the higheſt Authority that can be in the World, and that we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover without any difficulty in our Society, becauſe that though there are Sects among us who diſpute the Truth of its Tenets, yet there is nothing in it that can make that Height of Authority which has ſo many external marks to be oppoſed with any colourable pretence.</hi> In effect ſetting aſide their Opinions, their Worſhip, and their Religion it ſelf in the Foundation of it, they cannot diſpute with that <hi>Heathen</hi> Society from thoſe external marks upon which they would found that Authority. And the Chriſtians would not have been in a condition to have equal'd themſelves with them in that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97749:56"/>
regard. Would you have the conſent of many people? They had all the World of their ſide. Would you ſeek for Antiquity? They had been almoſt throughout all Ages. Do you require Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Proſperity? It was, ſay they, their Religion that gave them their Empire. Would you have Magnificence? Where was there any thing more Magnificent then their Temples, and more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did then their Solemnities? Would you have Unity? In the Plurality of their Gods, and Varieties of their Ceremonies, they kept peace among themſelves, and adopted the Gods of one an other. Do you demand Miracles? They boaſted that they had them, and the moſt Illuſtrious ones, as thoſe Oracles which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told things to come, thoſe Apparitions of their Gods, their Recoveries and Reſurrections from the dead. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then that could juſtify the Apoſtles, but the falſeneſs of the <hi>Pagan</hi>'s Religion, and the Truth of the Chriſtian. But for that they muſt of neceſſity enter upon that way of Examination, and make thoſe people to ſet about it whom they deſired to convert. But this is plainly that which that principle of the Author of thoſe Prejudices would have hindred as we have ſhewn. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that it is a pernitious Principle, contrary of Jeſus Chriſt, to his Apoſtles, and to the true Intereſts of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But can they anſwer nothing to theſe laſt Reflexions that I have made? It ſeems to me that they can poſſibly ſay but two things; the one, That thoſe who were converted by the word of the Apoſtles and the other Preachers of the Goſpel, were conſtrained to hear them, againſt that Order, by a ſecret inſpiration which dictated to them to make uſe of it alſo. The other thing is, That Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles proved their Call to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, from Heaven, and more eminent then that of their ordinary Paſtors by Miracles, and that in that Caſe, the Faithful are bound to go beyond that Rule, and to hear thoſe that ſhall be ſo ſent to them againſt that very Authority of the Church.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, I do not believe that wiſe perſons ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of it: For if they take thoſe ſecret inſpirations, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions that form within a man frequent and ſtrong deſires to do a thing, without ſuggeſting any Reaſon; the Spirit of God does not work ſo in the Converſion of men. It works, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Paul, as a light, that inlightens the underſtanding, to the end we may know what is the hope of our calling.</hi> Then when thoſe deſires and inward motions are contrary to that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97749:56"/>
duty to which we are all naturally engaged, they ought rather to paſs for Temptations, then for Inſpirations, and a man would be very much bound to repreſs them under that Quality, inſtead of following and obeying them. Thoſe pretended Inſpirations then which tended to make the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel be heard, would have been ſo far from having had that effect, that on the contrary, they would have gone farther againſt their Conſciences, becauſe they would have been found to have been contrary to a <hi>Duty,</hi> ſuppoſing that intire obedience to the Church in matters of Faith a <hi>Duty.</hi> They would have been troubled to know whether they ought to examine Religion or not: That Rule, might they ſay, would have me not do it; a blind Inſpiration which is not ſupported by any Reaſon, and which cannot have any certain mark of Divinity, can never be ſtrong enough to Authoriſe the breaking of that Rule. But it cannot be yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to ſerve for an excuſe towards that Religious Communion to which they had ſubmitted themſelves, for if that Communion had a right of Soveraignty over them, ſhe would not be bound to ſtrip her ſelf of it when an inſpiration ſhould ſpeak to them, and we can, but very ill defend the cauſe of the firſt Chriſtians, by that way. If they would underſtand it ſo as thoſe inward motions ſhould be ſupported by ſome Reaſon, that they ſhould not be intirely blind, it is neceſſary that they produce that Reaſon, and not ſpeak any more of Inſpiration.</p>
               <p>That Reaſon then, in my Judgment, can be no other, then thoſe Miracles that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles wrought, and by which they proved their Call to be divine and extraordinary. I confeſs, that if we ſuppoſe that all men have a right to make clear the Truth of things by themſelves, there is nothing more true then to ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be heard by their Miracles, and that their Miracles were made uſe of to prove their Heavenly Call. For their Miracles were plainly applied to the minds of men, to make them conſider that which they taught, and in the end joyning their Miracles to their Doctrine, they ſaw that they both mutually upheld one another, that neither of them were falſe, and that both the one and the other had the Characters of Divinity, they did then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from thence that their Call was Divine and Extraordinary. But if we ſuppoſe that Principle of the Author of Prejudices, there is nothing more falſe, then to ſay that their Miracles bound men to hear them, and prov'd their Call to be Extraordinary.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97749:57"/>
For that Principle being, as it is, founded upon the darkneſs of our underſtanding, upon the uncertainty of our Judgments, and the eaſineſs wherewith we are liable to deceive our ſelves, it is manifeſt that it ought to be extended even unto Miracles, becauſe that there are true and falſe Miracles, good and bad, and thoſe that falſe Prophets work as well as they that are ſent from God. We ought then to make a diſtinction, and a diſtinction that is not eaſy to be made, the Angels of darkneſs ſo diſguiſing themſelves into An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Light. But that Reaſon of the darkneſs of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the uncertainty of our Judgments, and that readineſs we have to deceive our ſelves, has (if you pleaſe) more place in that Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then in that of that Doctrine. We may be eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, and by conſequence we ought to give over that Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church, and yet follow in that its light and its deciſions. And if you would give to the ſimpler ſort, to thoſe Babes for Example whereof Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks, that his Myſteries have been revealed unto them, if you give them I ſay that right and liberty to judge of that important and fundamental Queſtion, to wit, Whether the Call of a man be Extraordinary and Divine, or whether it be not ſo, whether his Miracles are thoſe of a true Miniſter of God, or of a falſe Prophet, whether it be a true Angel of Light, or a diſguiſed Angel of darkneſs, and to judge of all thoſe things after the Church and againſt the Church, I ſee no Reaſon why they ſhould refuſe them the right and liberty of judging alſo of its Doctrine and the points of Religion, whereof the true knowledge is by nothing near ſo difficult.</p>
               <p>God had forewarned his People that they ſhould not give themſelves over to be deceiv'd by the firſt appearances of Miracles, and he had appointed that they ſhould judge of them by the Doctrine they accompanied. Whence it follows, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of Miracles, and judging of that Doctrine, are two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable things, and that their right belongs to the ſame perſons. <hi>If there ariſe,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>among you a Prophet, or a dreamer of dreams; and giveth thee a ſign or a wonder, And the ſign or the wonder come to paſs whereof he ſpake unto thee, ſaying, Let us go after other Gods, (which thou haſt not known) and let us ſerve them: Thou ſhalt not hearken unto the words of that Prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: For the Lord your God proveth you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart.</hi> It appears from thence, that the way for men to judge well of Miracles, is to examine the Doctrine of him that works them. So that if they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97749:57"/>
will a gree to give the people a right to diſcern Miracles, they cannot take away from them that of diſcerning that Doctrine they uphold. Jeſus Chriſt ſuppoſes the ſame thing when he ſays, that there ſhall <hi>ariſe falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, and that they ſhall work great ſigns and wonders, to ſeduce if it were poſſible the very Elect.</hi> For how could they otherwiſe diſcern thoſe Miracles of the falſe Prophets, but by examining their words?</p>
               <p>So a famous man of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion has not ſcrupled to write, that we are bound to reject Miracles, and thoſe men who make uſe of them, then when they are joyned with a Doctrine which the Church has condemned, his words are conſiderable, and very well deſerve to be tranſcrib'd. <hi>The Application,</hi> ſays he, <note place="margin">Le P. Annae dans un Ecrit centre le pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendu miracle du Port. Royal.</note> 
                  <hi>and direction of a miracle to prove the Truth of a Doctrine, is an enterpriſe ſo raſh, and ſo ſcandalous, that it deſerves to be puniſhed. There is not any Catholic in the World, who knows his Creed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it, that can be capable of ſuch a perſuaſion. What if the appearance of a Miracle is contrary to the definitions of the Church, can any one heſitate or doubt, whether it would be better to adhere to the Church ſupported by the truth of a Miracle, or to deny the truth of a Miracle founded upon the Authority of the Church? Saint</hi> Peter <hi>has taught us a great while ſince what we are to do on that occaſion. He had been an eye Witneſs of the Transfiguration of our Saviour, and of that glory that lay hid under the Vail of a Suffering and Mortal ſtate, and yet nevertheleſs he truſts more in the obſcurity of Prophets, than to the clear and manifeſt experience of his Eyes; we have a more ſure word of Propheſie. The Authority of the Church which is in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than that of the Prophets, breaks in pieces all thoſe reaſons that oppoſe it, and we ought to take to our ſelves in regard of the Church that which Saint</hi> Peter <hi>ſays with reſpect to the Prophets, To which we do well that we take heed, gathering together all our attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to know the true ſence of the Church, and turning aſide from all the Miracles, and all thoſe Reaſons the men propound to us to make us call into queſtion that which we know the Church to have determined.</hi> We may ſee clearly, by that paſſage, how far one may carry that Principle of the Authority of the Church, in the thoughts of thoſe that admit of it, that is to ſay, even to make Miracles themſelves ſubmit to it. He ſays, that we ought to Collect all our attention to know the true Sentiments of the Church, and to turn aſide from all thoſe Miracles which would make us call into queſtion that which the Church has determined. He ſays, that to go about to make uſe of Miracles for the proving of a Doctrine that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

by the Church, is a raſh and ſcandalous enterpriſe, and ſuch as deſerves to be puniſhed. In effect, if they ſuppoſe that Maxim that we ought to give to the Church an abſolute obedience, to ſee with her Eyes, and to reſt upon her Conduct, thoſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles could not make them be heard, whom the Church ſhould have condemned, and by which they ſhould have been looked on as falſe Miracles: the Conſequence is good and juſt. But becauſe that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing applied to the times of the firſt riſe of Chriſtianity, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the Unbeleivers, condemns the proceedings of Jeſus Chriſt and his Appoſtles, accuſes thoſe of raſhneſs who have believed on their preaching, deſtroys the Goſpel, and overthrows the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, it is a manifeſt proof that that Maxim it ſelf is falſe and raſh, ſince thoſe Conſequences that ariſe from it are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, that they leave neither to Jeſus Chriſt nor to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles any way to make their Goſpel to be heard by men, with a good Conſcience, and the care of their Salvation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They muſt give me leave to ſpeak a little earneſtly for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The more I conſider theſe ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable Conſequences of that Maxim, the more I am aſtoniſhed. If thoſe firſt Chriſtians, who had been <hi>Jews,</hi> could not hear the Doctrine of the Son of God, nor receive his Miracles, without violating of their Duty toward the Church that had condemned them, what ſcruples might not all that caſt into all the Chriſtians that are at this day in the World? For in fine we are the Succeſſors of that people, our Fathers were not Converted but by their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. If then we cannot ſee clearly that they themſelves had a right to be Converted; if they laid down on the contrary a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which of right ought to have hindered their Converſion, where then are all we, as many as we are? The Reaſons that the Author of thoſe <hi>Prejudices</hi> produces to make us deveſt our ſelves of our own guidance in favour of the Church, that we ſhould ſee with her Eyes and tread in her ſteps, had as much place with the <hi>Jews</hi> as they have with us, they could not doubt but that their Church was the Church of God, none can diſpute with them that eminent Authority which had ſo many external marks. <hi>To her belonged the Adoption, the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the Promiſes; of whom were the Fathers, and who had the Oracles of God committed unto them, and in whoſe boſom Chriſt according to the fleſh was born.</hi> If that Maxim of the Author of <hi>Prejudices</hi> were good, it muſt neceſſarily have been good for that Church which had condemned
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97749:58"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, his Perſon, his Call, his Miracles, his Doctrine, and what right then had his Diſciples to hear and follow him? We have ſeen them from Reaſon, and from the Teſtimony of a very conſiderable perſon of our Age, and to whom one of the greateſt Kings has given the honour of committing the concerns of his Conſcience to him, that if that Maxim had place, that we ought entirely to refer our ſelves to the Authority of the Church, we could not any more regard thoſe Miracles when they were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that Authority. Let them tell us then what right the Diſciples had to follow Jeſus Chriſt, by what right did the firſt Converts, and thoſe who were afterwards Converted by others, embrace the Goſpel? And if they did it without any right, and againſt their duty, into what Labyrinths we caſt you? What would become of the Chriſtian Church, what would become of you your ſelves? You form prejudices againſt us, drawn from the faults that have, ſay you, appeared in the perſons of our firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers. You tell us of a pretended precipitancy, by which the Magiſtrates of <hi>Zurich</hi> Reformed themſelves; you conclude from thence without entring upon the points in diſpute, that we ought to renounce the Reformation of our Fathers. Anſwer then your ſelves to the Prejudices, that according to your Maxim, the <hi>Jews</hi> may form againſt the firſt Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Conſequence that they may draw from thence, that without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring any further into a Diſcuſſing of the Points of that Religion, without examining either the Miracles or the Antient Prophecies, or the ſucceſs of the Preaching of the Goſpel, or all the other things that we could alledge in our favour, we ought to renounce our Chriſtianity. You your ſelves Authoriſe their Principle, by one that is altogether like it, which you lay down, and which you know not how to make uſe of againſt them, without overthrowing your ſelves; in a word, you draw the ſame Conſequence from it with them, ſhew us then by what ſecret Art both you and we may get out of that Abyſs whereinto you have plunged us. If your Fathers, ſay you, have Reformed themſelves with an ill deſign, you ought without farther examination to renounce their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. If the chief Authors of your Religion, a <hi>Jew</hi> will ſay, have adhered to <hi>Jeſus</hi> with an ill deſign, againſt the obligation which they had to cleave to the Church, you ought to renounce their Chriſtianity. Anſwer if you can to thoſe Arguments, and ſet our Conſciences in quiet. As for us indeed, we are not in pain: for we know that that Principle which you urge to thoſe unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97749:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is falſe. There is not any perſon who has not right to examine the points of that Religion, and to diſcern by himſelf the true from the falſe, the good from the bad, that which is from God, from that which which from men. The Authority of the Church never goes ſo far as to hinder us with any ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice from it, and ſo there is nothing to reproach the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But we ought not to give over theſe reflections, without making one upon the ſtate of the Church in the times of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> and of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> whereof I have ſpoken before. There is no perſon who knows not that the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> were then Maſters of the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtry, which they called the Catholick Church, treating the Orthodox as Hereticks and Diſturbers of its Peace, depoſing them and ſending them into baniſhment. <hi>The Poyſon of the</hi> Arrians, <hi>ſays</hi> Vincentius Lirinenſis, <hi>had not only infected one part, but almoſt all the world, and almoſt all</hi>

Apply then to them that Maxim which we have before oppoſed, and weigh thoſe Conſequences that may be drawn from it, againſt thoſe, and againſt the Faithful who Heard them and Read their Writings. The leaſt is, that they were Schiſmaticks, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptors of the people, who after having themſelves broken off that obedience which they owed to the Church, ſollicited others to do the like. They might have very well urged, that they had the Scriptures on their ſide, that they had the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> for them; but they would have anſwered them, That it was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time to diſpute, that they ought to ſubmit themſelves to, and acquieſce in the definitions of the Church. Since it was the duty of the Faithful to ſtrip themſelves of their own Conduct, to reſt upon that of the Church. Nevertheleſs, they did not fail gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to maintain the Truth, to diſpute and write for it, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves not only to the Biſhops, but to the people, and to defend it againſt that ſpecious name of a Church, which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97749:59"/>
they ſet before them, and the words of Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject are worthy of a particular conſideration. <hi>The Church,</hi> ſays <note place="margin">Hilar. adv.

Haec de comparatione traditae nobis olim Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae, nunc quam de perditae res ipſa que in oculis omnium eſt at que ore clamavit.</hi> Can any one be raſh enough to maintain, that he was bound then to refer himſelf to the Authority of that Church, to ſee with its Eyes, to tread in its Steps, and to reſt himſelf upon its Conduct? Will any ſay that that handful of good men who have ſince re-eſtabliſhed Chriſtianity, was nothing elſe but a company of Rebels, and of preſumptuous minds? Will they charge their Writing and their Letters to the people with Forgeries and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? Will they juſtifie their being Depoſed, their Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Perſecutions which they ſo conſtantly ſuffered? Will they ſay that the Faithful that heard them were raſh and Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and that thoſe on the contrary who ſubmitted themſelves to the deciſions of the Church, were thoſe good men, who did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their duty; and that we our ſelves at this day, who have received our Chriſtianity from the hands of that ſmall number, are but the followers of Rebels and Schiſmaticks? Yet all that they muſt ſay, if they lay down that Principle of abſolute Obedience. It appears then that that Principle is falſe and unjuſt, and invented for the ruin of Religion.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In effect, an abſolute obedience, and an intire reſigning of ones ſelf to the Conduct of another, as to thoſe matters that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Faith and the Conſcience, is a duty that we can render lawfully to none but God, who is the firſt Truth, the firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all Juſtice. A man cannot ſubmit his underſtanding and his heart to the word of any one, ſo as to believe blindly that which he ſays, without giving him a kind of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for there can be no homage greater than that of an inward blind ſubmiſſion. It is an infinite act, according as a creature may be ſaid to act infinitely, that is to ſay without bounds, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, without meaſure. It is then an act that can belong to none but God immediately, that we ought not to transfer to the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97749:60"/>
Church, if we would not adore the Church; and to which by Conſequence a Church can never pretend without uſurping the juſt rights of God.</p>
               <p n="11">11. God himſelf has ſo far forborn his right, that he does not very often abſolutely make uſe of it, but leaves it to our minds to judge of the Truths that he propounds to us. For there are often in thoſe things that he teaches us, Characters that equally note their Truth and their Divinity, ſo that at all times we may draw theſe two concluſions from them, <hi>This Doctrine is true, this Doctrine is of God,</hi> without their depending one upon the other. We may ſay the ſame of his Commandments, they bear moſt frequently Characters of their Natural Juſtice, as well as thoſe of their Divinity; and they give us leave to receive them not only by an Act of Obedience, but by an Act of Judgment alſo. As it is from him that we hold that admirable faculty of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the true from the falſe, the good from the bad, by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters impreſt in thoſe things themſelves, ſo he would not take a way the uſe of it in matters of Religion. On the contrary, it is ordinarily by the uſing of that, that he draws us, that he convinces us firſt of all of the Truth of ſome Doctrines, that he makes us afterwards acknowledg the neceſſary connexion that they have with others which he has revealed to us, the Truth whereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not ſo clearly, abſtractly conſidered at firſt, and by that connexion he makes us receive them. He ſhews us the equity of his Precepts, the horror of thoſe Vices that are contrary to them, and in that manner he gains our Hearts, by making uſe of our own Reaſon. Not that we may lawfully reject any of thoſe things which he teaches us; we have no right for that without doubt, becauſe where our Underſtandings are wanting to diſcover thoſe Characters of Truth or of Equity in thoſe things which he teaches us, there he has ordained that his Authority ſhall help us. It is God that ſays it, it is God that commands it: but it is not the ſame with reſpect to the Church; the Church is not God, ſhe is but an Interpreter and Servant of God: ſhe ought then to ſhew us in all that ſhe teaches us as matter of Faith, or that ſhe commands the Conſcience to ſubmit to, thoſe Characters of Truth and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the things themſelves, or elſe thoſe of their Divinity; when ſhe fails in that, ſhe cannot ſupply that defect by her Authority; for in that caſe her Authority is purely no other than Humane, and an Humane Authority is not ſufficient either for the Faith, or for the Conſcience: ſo that every man has right to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97749:60"/>
that which ſhe teaches, and to reject that that is beyond the word of God.</p>
               <p n="12">12. In fine, Let thoſe Gentlemen tell us if they pleaſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this ſame Queſtion concerning the Soveraign Authority of the Latin Church, and the Obligation that lies upon every one to hold himſelf to its deciſions, they mean, that every one ſhould refer himſelf to the Latin Church, and believe alſo meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſhe ſays ſo, without any other examination; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would grant that every one may have right to examine of what nature, of what extent, and of what force that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is, and how far that Obedience goes which he ought to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it. There is no likelyhood they will ſay the former; for that Authority cannot eſtabliſh it ſelf; when it ſhall be eſtabliſht, a man may refer himſelf to it for other things, but while her own eſtabliſhment is diſputed, it is requiſite it ſhould come from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe, and that there ſhould be for that proofs capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading us. To what purpoſe do they tell us of its <hi>external marks which makes us,</hi> ſays the Author of the Prejudices, <hi>diſcover without any difficulty that height of Authority which is in the Catholick Church,</hi> if they would not leave the Faithful a right to ſee thoſe external marks, and to examine them not any farther by the Eyes of the Church, but by their own? That being ſo, they may ſee that they ought always to give men a right of making a Judgment by their own light, and to give them in that Queſtion the moſt important matter of all, to wit, that of chooſing a Rule and a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Principle for their Guidance and their Faith, an Authority upon which their Minds and Conſciences may reſt, and lye down in perfect Peace. They muſt give them that in that Queſtion which it is no ways eaſie for them to decide; For beſides that they ought to ſee thoſe external marks of the Latin Church, which ſay they, gain her ſo great an Authority, they ought alſo to ſee whether there are not others which they take away more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from her then thoſe that they give her; they ought to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe marks are not common to other Religious Societies, that may by that means diſpute with the Latin Church that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; they ought to ſee whether thoſe marks when they ſhall become peculiar to the Latin Church, may be capable of giving her ſo Soveraign an Authority over mens Faith and Conſciences. which ſeems naturally to belong to none but God. And becauſe in that Queſtion, we treat not of the whole Body of the Church, but only of the Prelats, and thoſe who take up the Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97749:61"/>
Function, they ought to know whether thoſe external marks can hinder them from believing that thoſe Prelats have abuſed their charges, and brought in, or ſuffered to be brought in divers Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions into the Church. All that is not ſo eaſie as the Authour of the Prejudices tells us it is. There is ſome difficulty to get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet that belonging of right to the examination of all men, the darkneſs of the underſtanding, the eaſineſs wherewith men may deceive themſelves, the want of neceſſary helps, the ignorance and ſimplicity of the greateſt part of men, would not hinder it. Thoſe are then no other than frivolous Reaſons, which cannot take away from men that right that God and Nature have given them. They ought therefore to enjoy it, at leaſt in ſome reſpect, to wit, for the deciding of the queſtion, whether they ought to loſe it or no.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But it is certain they can never ſo enjoy it in that regard, nor decide that Queſtion without entring upon an examination of all their Doctrines, which lets us ſee yet more and more the abſurdity of our Adverſaries Principle. For there is not any Principle more abſurd, than that which deſtroys it ſelf, which cannot be eſtabliſhed but by making uſe of a contrary Principle, and which preciſely can have no place, but there where it cannot be of any uſe. But all that may be ſaid of that Principle of thoſe Gentlemen, ſince it is moſt true that to eſtabliſh it, one muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily proceed to examine their Doctrines, and that they can never know whether they ought to refer themſelves to the Latin Church, or examine that Doctrine by themſelves, till they have made that examination, that is to ſay, till there ſhall be no farther occaſion to refer themſelves to that Authority of the Latin Church, which makes pleaſant ſport enough. This is that which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently manifeſt, if one conſider it, that before one can acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Authority of the Latin Church, it muſt be ſuppoſed, that one is aſſured that among all the Religious Societies that are in the World, the Chriſtian is the only one in which one ought to place himſelf; and that can never be known but by one way only, which is that of examining its Doctrine and its Worſhip. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect there is not any one of thoſe external marks that can make that difference. The Jews had their Miracles, Antiquity, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, an uninterrupted Duration, the Holineſs of their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, the Light of their Prophecies, the Majeſty of their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; we do not diſpute theſe marks with them, and as to Temporal Proſperity, they had it heretofore, and we are not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97749:61"/>
that we have always had that, whereof we make ſuch boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which nevertheleſs is not very great. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they have the ſame things, with the conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the admirable ſucceſs of their Arms; and as for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which they fail in, they ſay, that as Jeſus Chriſt did but ſucceed <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo <hi>Mahomet</hi> alſo has ſucceeded Jeſus Chriſt. As for the Heathens they had, as I have ſaid, their Miracles, their Saints, their Prophets, their Ceremonies, their Succeſſion, their uninterrupted Duration, their Temporal Proſperities; and if we ſtrive with them about Antiquity, and Multitude, the advantage will not lye on our ſide. There is then nothing more deceitful than thoſe external appearances, ſeparated from their Doctrines, they are as proper to make a Jew remain a Jew, a Heathen a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and a Mahometan to remain a Mahometan, as to make a Chriſtian to remain a Chriſtian; whence it follows, that to form well that difference, and to be aſſured that the Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is the only good one, one ought to examine its Worſhip and its Doctrines.</p>
               <p>Moreover, before they could acknowledge the Authority of the Latin Church, they muſt ſuppoſe, that a man is ſure that among all the Chriſtian Sects, the Latin only is the true Church, and that cannot be known but by the examination of its Doctrines. Thoſe external marks can be no ways proper for it. The <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> aſcribe to themſelves Antiquity, Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Miracles, an uninterrupted Duration, as well as the <hi>Latins.</hi> They have their Saints, their Prophets, their Ceremonies, and their Multitude, which is not leſs conſiderable; and as to worldly Proſperity, the <hi>Abyſſines</hi> may boaſt of it, and the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> alſo, who make a part of the Greek Church, and who knows whether that of the Latin Church ſhall never change? It is then manifeſt, that they can conclude nothing from thoſe marks ſeparated from their Doctrine, they are ſo ambiguous, and uncertain, that they cannot fix any ſetled Judgment upon them, concerning the truth of the Latin Church.</p>
               <p>But, ſuppoſing that they could by thoſe external marks, or by any other ways which they would take, be aſſured that the Latin Church was the true Church, I ſay, it muſt neceſſarily be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in this Sence, to wit, that in that viſible Communion God brings up and preſerves his truly Faithful ones; For it is in thoſe only that that name of the viſible Church is verified, and not in the prophane, the wicked, and the worldly, who are mingled
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97749:62"/>
with them, and who are none of that Body that is the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt. They muſt then be aſſured, before they can know whether they ought to refer themſelves abſolutely to that Body of Paſtors that governs the Latin Church, that the prophane and the worldly do not prevail in that Body, and that they never have prevailed; for if they do prevail, or if they ever have prevailed, they may introduce errours into the publick Miniſtry, and falſe Worſhip, or ſuffer them to come in through their negligence or otherwiſe, or ſcatter abroad the ill Doctrines of the Schools a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the People, favour ill cuſtoms, and in a word, corrupt that Communion, as it appears that that did come to paſs in the Jewiſh Church, and ſometimes in the Chriſtian. But how can any be fully aſſured that it may not be ſo at preſent, otherwiſe then by the examining of her Doctrine? They ought then to give up that point of external marks; our Fathers have gained their cauſe without going any farther, by the Prejudices of Corruption which I have ſet down in the ſecond and third Chapters. But if you take them only as meer conjectures, and if you will reckon them to be nothing, it is certain, that to be aſſured that there is nothing corrupted in a Communion where God brings up and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his true Faithful people, that the publick Miniſtry is pure in all its Doctrines and in its Worſhip, one muſt of neceſſity take that way of examination, and that examination muſt be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act. So that before we can enter only upon that Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought to give to the Latin Church a Soveraign Authority over our Faith and Conſciences, the diſcuſſing of which they know not how to avoid, all muſt be examined: from whence it follows that that Principle which I have oppoſed is abſur'd, becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys it ſelf, and none can ever practiſe it, till it cannot be any more of any uſe; and more abſur'd yet, in that when it would hinder us from examining, it conſtrains us to make an examination as exact as can be thought of.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>TO defend in ſome manner a Principle that Scripture, Reaſon, the Intereſt of the Antient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and the Chriſtians, do ſo loudly condemn, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſome Inconveniences which ariſe, they pretend, from that of the Contrary Principle: But it is certain, that if it were enough to alleadge thoſe Inconveniences to overthrow thoſe Rights which are found to be ſo ſolidly eſtabliſhed, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world ſure, ſince there is nothing ſo juſt, ſo reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or ſo neceſſary, which the weakneſs or the malice of men may not abuſe. It is neceſſary to yield to men the right of eating and drinking, of Cloathing and Marrying themſelves, of ſelling and buying, of holding Commerce between themſelves, of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Houſes and Towns, and to diſtinguiſh themſelves by their ſeveral Arts and Profeſſions. And yet how many Inconveniences are there that ariſe from all thoſe things? It is the ſame in the uſage of the moſt holy and inviolable things, as of Religion it ſelf, of which a <hi>Libertine,</hi> ſays in General, becauſe of the Abuſes that were made of it,</p>
               <q>Tantum Religio potuit ſuadere malorum.</q>
               <p>If all muſt be aboliſht that is ſubject to Inconveniences, one muſt aboliſh every thing. Gold and Iron, Night and Day, Fire and Water would be criminal, and the very Air it ſelf which makes us live, cauſes ſometimes our death. They cannot then take a worſe way then that of thoſe Inconveniences to cry down a Right, founded upon Nature, and upon Grace, and Authorized by Jeſus Chriſt, by the Prophets and Apoſtles. Let us ſee nevertheleſs of what nature thoſe Inconveniencies are.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt Conſiderable is, That if they allow thoſe who are ſubject to the Church, to Examine the matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, there will be no more any way to keep men in the Unity
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97749:63"/>
of the Faith, that every one will have a Religion by himſelf, and that by this means they ſhould open a way for Extravagancies and Hereſies, and by conſequence for the intire ruin of the Church, ſince the minds of men are ſo different and confuſed that that which pleaſes one, will not pleaſe another.</p>
               <p>To Anſwer to that Objection, I would demand of thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen whether they propoſe to themſelves to find out any humane and efficacious way, which ſhall go ſo far as actually and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to hinder thoſe Extravagances and Hereſies; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would only eſtabliſh a Maxim, which in ſuppoſing that it ſhould be followed, and that all men would receive it, ſhould contain all in the Unity of the Faith. Let them take which of thoſe two ſides they pleaſe, they cannot rationally ſay any thing. The firſt contains a raſh and abſurd pretence, for to go about to ſeek a humane means that ſhall actually hinder all Errors and Hereſies, is to ſeek for that which they can never be able to find. To retain men in the Unity of the Faith and of True Piety, two things are neceſſary, the one, That they teach all the pure Truths of God; and the other, That they give them all a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to the end they ſhould follow it. Their Paſtors might very well do the firſt, but the ſecond, which does not depend on them, none but God alone can do. And that alſo he does in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of all his Elect and truly Faithful for whoſe ſake only there is a Church, and Paſtors in the World. For he beſtows on all thoſe his Holy Spirit, in that meaſure that ſhall ſuffice to unite them in the ſame Faith, and to hinder them from falling into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours wholly inconſiſtent with their Salvation. As for the others, as he has not ordained their Salvation, ſo he would not actually hinder them from caſting themſelves into Hereſies, or into Errors. On the contrary, he has reſolved to permit thoſe ſtrayings, the better to diſtinguiſh them from his True Children. <hi>There muſt be alſo,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Hereſies among you, that they which are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>approved may be made manifeſt among you.</hi> And elſewhere he ſays, <hi>That God ſhould ſend ſtrong deluſions to them that periſh, that they ſhould believe a lye.</hi> So that God who alone is Lord of the hearts <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</note> and minds of men, not having propounded that end to himſelf in eſtabliſhing his Viſible Church, to hinder any Hereſies from being in the World, nor that they ſhould not ariſe within that very Church it ſelf, but only that his Elect and truly Faithful ones ſhould not be infected with them, it is a great raſhneſs, for thoſe men who cannot diſpoſe hearts as he does, to extend not only
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97749:63"/>
their deſires but their pretenſions alſo farther, and to ſearch out a way by which there ſhould not be in effect any Hereſie. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that we ought to deſire the deſtruction of all Hereſies, that we ought to labour for their Extirpation, and that as the Elect and true Children of God are not diſtinctly known, the cares that we ſhould take for them ought to be extended indifferently to all. But I ſay, that we cannot make uſe of any thing for ſo great a work, but thoſe external means, which are the pure Preaching of the Truth, and Confuting the contrary Errors. When their Paſtors ſhall acquit themſelves well in that duty, they may reſt aſſured that God will bleſs their conduct and their word, not to all men, but to the perſons of his true Children. If their Paſtors would urge their pretenſions from thence, and would find a human expedient that might abſolutely hinder thoſe Hereſies from touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and from actually and effectually ſpringing up as well among the good, as the wicked; I affirm, that they would be wiſer then God, that they would encroach upon his rights, that they would hunt for a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and that by that very means they would change the Miniſtry into a Tyranny; for under that pretence of rooting out thoſe Hereſies, they would come to be Soveraign Lords over mens Souls and Conſciences, which cannot nor ought to be ſuffered, and which is ſo far from being a means to avoid them, that it would fill the Church with Hereſies.</p>
               <p>If they ſay, they intend only to eſtabliſh a Maxim, which ſuppoſing that it would be followed, and that all men would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, would contain all in the Unity of the Faith, and that Maxim is, That they ought to refer themſelves abſolutely to their Paſtors. I ſay, in the firſt place, That, that Maxim is as proper to contain men in the Unity of Hereſie and of Schiſm, as in the Unity of Faith. For the Hereticks and Schiſmaticks have their Church and their Paſtors, to whom they ſhould abſolutely refer themſelves. So that they could never diſcern whether they are in Unity of the Faith, or in that of Error and wandring from the Truth, if they were not before all things, aſſured that they were in the true Church. But who ſhall warrant us, that when they would be ſo aſſured of the true Church, that men would not divide themſelves by different ſentiments, and that that which pleaſes one, ſhould not diſpleaſe another? What principle of Unity would they give us, to ſettle all in the ſame thoughts, in that ſearch which they ſhould make of the true Church? The <hi>Jews</hi> would ſay, We are the true Church of God, the Mother
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97749:64"/>
Church, from which the Chriſtians have ſeparated themſelves, The <hi>Pagans</hi> will ſay, We are that Mother Communion, for as well the <hi>Jews</hi> as the Chriſtians came out of the midſt of us. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> will ſay, That as Chriſtianity was the perfection of the Law, ſo their Religion is the perfection of the Goſpel. The <hi>Greeks</hi> would come foorth and maintain, That they are the true Catholick Church, and not the <hi>Latins;</hi> the <hi>Copticks,</hi> the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> maintain, That as well the <hi>Latins</hi> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> departed from the Church, when their Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> had made void the Council of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> The <hi>Arians</hi> will ſay, That if one latter Council could abrogate what had been done by a former, as it appears from the Example of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> then that of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> might very well correct and repair the Errors of that of <hi>Nice.</hi> In fine, every one would alledge his Reaſons, and concern himſelf to know which of all thoſe Communions was the true and good one, and which had the true Faith. Tell us what means of Unity would you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, to hinder men from dividing themſelves? For if it be true that in yielding men a right to examine the matters of Religion, they open a Gate to let in Diviſions and Hereſies, by reaſon of the Confuſion of mens minds, it is not leſs true that in leaving them a liberty to examine thoſe Churches and Religious Societies, to come to know which is the True, you open the ſame Gate to Errors and Apoſtacies. If you would further take from them that Liberty of ſearching out the true Church, and if you ſay that they ought to ſuppoſe the <hi>Latin</hi> to be it, without other reaſon; beſides that that is very abſurd, you introduce a Maxim that under a pretence of ſhutting the Door to all Diviſions, ſhuts it alſo to all Converſions. For why ſhould not every Society have right to ſay the ſame thing? So the <hi>Jew,</hi> without any other Reaſon, would preſume for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Communion; the <hi>Heathen</hi> for the <hi>Heathen;</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> for the <hi>Greek,</hi> and every one for that wherein he finds himſelf ſet. That then would not be ſo much a Principle of Unity in the true Faith, as a Principle of Confuſion and Obſtinacy, a Principle that would be not ſo proper to keep men in the Unity of the true Faith, as in that of any Religion whatſoever it might be, without coming to know whether it were good or bad.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, I ſay, That with all that, they do not yet make any thing of that which they would lay down, if they would avoid thoſe Hereſies, and thoſe Diviſions which may ariſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97749:64"/>
from the inequality of humane underſtandings, when men are left to be Maſters of their own Sentiments. For to obtain that effect, they muſt ſuppoſe that that Maxim of referring ones ſelf abſolutely to the Paſtors of the true Church, when they ſhall be ſo aſſured, will be received and followed by all men. But who can tell them that men will not divide upon that very Principle, and that when they endeavour to make them receive it, they can make them agree? If they apprehend ſo much thoſe Diviſions and Errors in the matters of Religion, what aſſurance can they have that there ſhall not be any upon that point of the Authority of the Church? Is it becauſe mens minds will leſs differ about that ſubject then about others, or that that ſame Authority proves it ſelf, as the Firſt Principles do? Who has told them, that thoſe who ſhall once have received this Maxim, will not be un-blinded in the end, and that they will not be weary in fine of remaining ſlaves to men in reſpect of their Conſciences, which is the moſt conſiderable part of themſelves, and that which ſhould give them the greateſt Jealouſie? So that that pretended Remedy of Schiſms and Diviſions is null, for you muſt always run upon that Rock you would avoid, to wit of the humane underſtanding, and wipe off its differences, its inequalities, its humors, at the ſame time that you would have them give away that liberty of judging the points of the Faith. Let us ſuppoſe, ſince our Adverſaries would have us, that that Principle of abſolute obedience to the Guides of the Church, had had place from the birth of Chriſtianity, would it have hindred the Hereſies of the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> of the <hi>Gnoſtics,</hi> of the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> of the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> and the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees?</hi> Would it have hindred the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the <hi>Samoſatences,</hi> the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> and ſo many others, that in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity troubled the State of Religion? To ſay that thoſe men were preſumptuous and raſh, is but to ſay what we would have, which is, that there can be no humane means that can ſtop that raſhneſs and preſumptuouſneſs of men, and that it is a folly to go about to do it. They may by the force of Torments and Priſons, by their Threats or their Promiſes hinder the external effects, but that is not to contain men in the Unity of the Faith, but it is to contain them in that of Hypocriſy, and of Treachery.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Inconvenience is, That they cannot give to the Church, that is to ſay, to the Body of the Paſtors, that reſpect which is due to them; for where they ſhould be ſet up to be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97749:65"/>
Judges of Controverſies, private men would riſe up againſt them, and thoſe private men would on the contrary become their Judges. But that Inconvenience is not ſo great, as that it ſhould make us hazard our own Salvation. How many Judges have in we our Civil Society, to whom we yet give that reſpect that is due to them, though ſtill we are not bound to believe that all that they have judged, is well judged? The reſpect which men owe to their Paſtors is not unlimited, it has its bounds and its meaſures; while they act as true Paſtors, in Teaching the pure Truth, and acquitting themſelves of their Duty, they are worthy to be heard, to be followed, to be reſpected. But when they come to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, if, that in ſtead of Teaching the Truth they oppoſe it, if they mix with Gold and Silver, Wood, Hay, and Stubble, (to make uſe of the words of the Apoſtle) they deſerve in that regard, neither the Hearing, nor Reſpect. For they are neither Paſtors, nor the Church, but only as they Teach the Truth, and follow Righteouſneſs; and when they withdraw themſelves from it, give us their own Fancies, or when they follow their Paſſions, then they are but private men, who belye their Character, and they can owe them nothing for thoſe kinds of things, but repulſes and contempt, or at the moſt but Indulgence, if the Evil be yet tolerable; that is to ſay, if their word and their conduct do not deſtroy the Goſpel, or hinder a ſaving efficacy. But if they may ſee their Miniſtry to become ſo corrupted that their is an eminent danger of looſing their Salvation, who can doubt that they ought not to be lookt on, only as the Enemies of God and the Church, rather then the Miniſters and their Paſtors, and that they ſhould not fail to take heed of them and their Doctrine, as pernitious leaven, in ſtead of blindly following them? The Duties are then reciprocal between the Paſtors and the People: The Paſtors ought to guide their Flock well, to give them good paſture; and the people owe them, Reſpect, Obedience Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and Love: on ſuppoſition that the Paſtors well acquit themſelves of their duty, thoſe who are under them will become guilty before God and Men, of the Crimes of Rebellion Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, and Ingratitude, if they do not acquit themſelves of theirs. But if the Paſtors abuſe their charges, if they overturn the Goſpel, or if they do any thing coming near to it, if they abuſe their Titles; their Sees, their Dignities, their Sacerdotal Ornaments; all that will ſignify nothing, they owe them no more in that regard, either that Reſpect or that Obedience. The
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97749:65"/>
Reaſon is manifeſt, becauſe they ought to reſpect nothing but the cauſe of God, and upon the Conſideration of its ſaving Truth, when then they may ſee that they withdraw themſelves from God, and that Truth, that reſpect alſo which ought to be given to God and his Truth ſhould be withdrawn from them.</p>
               <p>And as to what they ſay, that private men would become Judges of their Paſtors, where of right thoſe Paſtors ought to Judge of Controverſies, who are above private men; this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a playing with words. How many of our Judges are there, who Judge us every day, without our finding any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience or ill in it? They Judge us with a Judgment of <note n="*" place="margin">Imputation, by laying things to our charge.</note> Indictment, which is a publick Judgment, and they Judge us with a Judgment of Diſtinction, which is a private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For they do not bind us blindly to believe that all that they declare is equitable, becauſe they ſo declare it; we have in that reſpect a full liberty to examine thoſe things as they are in themſelves, though we fail of always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming in their favour. But ſay they, whatſoever liberty we have to examine their Judgments, their Judgments muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted notwithſtanding, when we our ſelves believe them unjuſt; I confeſs it, but it is becauſe their Execution conſiſts only in thoſe things, or in thoſe external Actions, which leave the thoughts of the mind always free, and not in an inward acquieſcence. And this is that that puts a difference between their Sentences, and the deciſions of Paſtors concerning the matters of Religion, for the Execution of theſe latter conſiſts in an acquiſcence of the Soul and the Conſcience, which cannot but examine them in the end, and be decided but by the knowledge we have of the Equity and Truth of thoſe Doctrines. The ſame thing may ſometimes happen in the Civil Society, where in ſtead of putting in Execution the Commands of Superiours, one ſhall be bound formally to oppoſe and reſiſt them; as when the Sates of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or a Governour ſhall command things prejudicial to the Obedience that one owes to one's Soveraign, and which would engage the people in a Rebellion; Then, we may not only Judge our Judges by a private Judgment, but our private Judgment is a thouſand times more general and publick then that of thoſe Judges, yea though it ſhall not be accompanied with any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality. For thoſe formalities ſignify nothing, when the fidelity which we owe to our Prince is concerned. Then neither reſpect of Magiſtrates, nor conſideration of Order, nor the Authority
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97749:66"/>
of our Governours ought to turn us aſide, but they muſt all give place to that Great and Fundamental Duty. It is the ſame thing in a Religious Society, God and our Salvation are to be preferred before all things, and if it fall out that the Paſtors, either in their Pulpits, or in their Writings, or in their Councils, would plunge us into errors, and into a worſhip that diſhonours God, and corrupts his Chriſtian Religion, we may not only judge them by a private judgment, but we ought alſo at the ſame time to labour to make that private judgment to become publick, and as general as it can be made; and howſoever we do it, we do not in any thing withdraw our ſelves from that fidelity which we all owe to God. The Inconveniences that ariſe from that Conduct, ought to be imputed not to private men, who do but what they are obliged to do, but to the Paſtors who abuſe their Charge, and pervert the rule and natural deſign of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
               <p>But, ſay they, Is not this to introduce a private ſpirit into the Church, where we all ought to have but one ſame ſpirit, which is that of the Church? <hi>There is,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, but one Body and but one Spirit,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.</note> and therefore it is that he himſelf exhorts us <hi>to abide all in the ſame ſpirit, and to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</hi> I anſwer, that there ought to be in the Church in effect but one and the ſame Spirit; but that that ought to be the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Truth, the Spirit of Wiſdom: not the ſpirit of the World, not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.</note> the ſpirit of Errour. God gives his holy Spirit immediatly to all his truly Faithful ones, whether they be Paſtors, or whether they be Lay-men, which is in all but one ſame Spirit, though the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure according to which each receives may be different: <hi>Grace,</hi> ſays <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.</note> the Apoſtle, <hi>is given unto every one of us according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> And in that Deſcription of the State of the Church under the new Teſtament, which is ſet down by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Joel.</hi> God ſays, <hi>That he will purer out his Spirit upon all fleſh,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>that their Sons and their Daughtes ſhall Prophecy, and that he will give this Spirit to his Servants and to his Handmaids.</hi> Elſewhere, God promiſes his Children, <hi>That he will give them a new heart and</hi>

                  <hi>a new ſpirit, and that he will put his Spirit within them:</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teaches the ſame thing. <hi>By one Spirit,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we are all Baptized into one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>free, and have been all made to drink into one ſpirit. Becauſe ye are Children,</hi> ſays he <hi>to the</hi> Galatians, <hi>God has ſent forth the Spirit of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>his Son into your hearts;</hi> and in the Epiſtle which he addreſſes to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97749:66"/>
the Saints and Faithful of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he tells them, <hi>That they were</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe,</hi> and deſiring that they might receive a more abundant meaſure of it, he prayed God to give them <hi>the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation:</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his age, who were perſecuted for the name of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>That the Spirit of Glory, and the Spirit of God reſted upon them,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.</note> In fine the whole Scripture is full of this Doctrine, that the Spirit of God is immediately given to every Believer, even down to that place where St. <hi>John</hi> tells them, <hi>That they had an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the Holy Spirit, and that they knew all things; that the anointing which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>they had received of Jeſus Chriſt abode in them, and that they needed not that any man ſhould teach them, but that that anointing taught them all things.</hi> From whence theſe two Truths reſult, the one, That every faithful one in particular has Fellowſhip with the Holy Spirit, which animates and governs him immediatly; and the other, That that Spirit is not a meer Spirit of Docility, and reſting in what is taught them, to make the Faithful receive the words of their Paſtors; but a Spirit of diſcerning, which makes them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of knowing things by themſelves, and to judge of them. For this is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> means by that <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> by that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction which teaches all things,</hi> and frees us from the neceſſity of being taught by men; that is to ſay, of depending abſolutely on their Authority, as thoſe men would do who ſhould not be capable of diſcerning by themſelves; and there is this thing very conſiderable in that Diſcourſe of St. <hi>John,</hi> that he makes the ſubjects of it, thoſe falſe Teachers who laboured to ſeduce the Faithful. <hi>I have,</hi> ſays he, <hi>wrote theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe who ſeduce you; But the anointing which you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived abideth in you, and you have no need that any man ſhould teach you,</hi> &amp;c. Which lets us plainly ſee that he meant, that that Unction was ſufficient to ſecure them from that Seducing, and by Conſequence to make them diſcern by themſelves the true from the falſe. As to all the reſt, they do but mock when they call that Spirit a private Spirit, under a pretence that it is given to each Believer: for it is the ſame Spirit that animates the whole Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body of our Saviour, that Regenerates and Sanctifies them, it is in one word, the Spirit of the whole Church. It may with far greater reaſon be ſaid, that they introduce a private Spirit, who reſtrain to the Paſtors alone the right of diſcerning the good from the bad, and who would not that any Laymen ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For if the whole body be animated but by one only and the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97749:67"/>
ſame Spirit, why ſhould not all the Faithful have the ſame right with the Paſtors, ſince they all partake of one ſame Light, though in a different meaſure? In fine, if they would have it, that to yield to every one a right to examine the matters of Religion, would be to bring in a private Spirit, let them tell us, by what Spirit they would have one examine the queſtion of the Church? by what Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit they would have every one know and reſt aſſured that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church is the True Church of Jeſus Chriſt? by what Spirit they would have the Faithful chuſe that ſide where they ſhould refer themſelves to their Paſtors? for in all thoſe points, they cannot deny that men ought to follow their own light, ſince they cannot in the leaſt make thoſe judgments by the Eyes of their Prelates, as we have noted before. Behold then that private Spirit, ſince it pleaſes theſe Gentlemen to call it ſo, which they themſelves are conſtrained to admit, which ſhews us the nullity of that inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that they would pretend to remedy.</p>
               <p>We ought then to go higher yet, and to examine that great Argument which the Author of thoſe <hi>Prejudices</hi> has choſe above all others, as being alone ſufficient to make us acknowledge the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of referring ones ſelf blindly to the Church. It conſiſts in letting us know, <hi>That all the men in the world may deceive themſelves,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In his Preface.</note> 
                  <hi>that the darkneſs of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings, our Prejudices and our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions engage us to that. And if</hi> M. Claude, ſays he, <hi>can propoſe evident falſhoods as proofs of the higheſt certainty, who can aſſure us that we are not in the number of thoſe who deceive themſelves, and make an ill choice in the matters of Religion, and that the perſuaſion that we have well choſen is not any effect of our Prejudices and our Paſſions, and other ſecret obſtinacy in our Opinions; from whence he concludes, that it muſt be a thing to be deſpaired of ever to be able to diſtinguiſh the true Religion, amidſt ſo many Sects who all lay claim to it, or to chuſe among ſo many Opinions which they propoſe as Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed by the Scripture, thoſe which one ought to believe, from thoſe that one ought to reject, unleſs that ſame impotence that lies upon us to diſcern the Truth by our own light, and which would not open a way to find it, ſhould make us go from the way of Reaſon, wherein we ſhould ſee nothing but uncertainty, to that of Authority, which would draw us out of that confuſion,</hi> and in the end he advertiſes us, that that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is <hi>that of the Catholick Church,</hi> that is to ſay, the Latin Prelates.</p>
               <p>We ſee then, that thanks to the Philoſophy of this Author, all muſt be good <hi>Pyrrhoniſts,</hi> to become good Catholicks, we ought to doubt of every thing if we would be aſſured of any thing. But
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97749:67"/>
to ſpeak what appears to me, that Argument cannot make any impreſſion on the mind, becauſe it deſtroys it ſelf, as uſually thoſe falſe ſubtilties do. For if we cannot be aſſured in thoſe judgments that we make by our own Light, becauſe that may deceive us, who can aſſure us that that Authors Argument will be good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, ſince we cannot judg of it but by that ſame Light, which will not give, according to him, any certainty? If the uſe of our Reaſon produces nothing but doubts, why would he yet give us a Reaſon, the Conſequence whereof can be no other than doubtful, and by which he cannot alſo gain any thing over us? It may be it is good, it may be it is not ſo; our Light deceives us in other things, it may very well deceive us in that. What likelyhood then is there that we ſhould be perſuaded by an Argument that combates it ſelf, and which takes away from it ſelf the force of perſuading?</p>
               <p>Moreover, That Argument deſtroys the deſign of the Author of thoſe <hi>Prejudices,</hi> and overthrows the Cauſe it would Eſtabliſh. For if there be no certainty in the judgments that we make by our own Light, who ſhall ſecure us that we do not deceive our ſelves in chuſing the way of Authority, ſince we cannot make choice of that, but by that ſame Light, which is, ſays he, ſo deceitful? We cannot leſs fear in that very thing, the obſcurity of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, our Prejudices and Paſſions, the inclination that we have to Error, and who ſhall aſſure that Author, who ſhall aſſure us our ſelves, that that perſuaſion where it is, and which he would communicate to us, is not an effect <hi>of his Prejudices, of his Paſſions, or of ſome obſtinacy in his Opinions?</hi> Who ſhall warrant us that we do not deceive our ſelves in that particular choice that we make of the Authority of the Latin Church, to refer our ſelves to her? For we muſt in that choice rely on our own Reaſon. Who ſhall ſecure us that the Lain Church herſelf does not deceeive her ſelf in the diſcerning that ſhe makes of the Tenets of Religion? That Church is compoſed of the People and Prelates, thoſe people have not more Light than other men, and thoſe Prelates are not leſs ſubject than the others to that darkneſs of underſtanding, to Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, to Prejudices, to Paſſions, to a ſecret Obſtinacy in their Opinions, and beyond all, that they have not a peculiar Intereſt to favour mens Errors and Superſtitions, to retain them the more eaſily in their obedience. But thoſe People and thoſe Prelates are a very great number. What does that ſignifie? The Heathens and their Guides are yet a far greater number than they, and yet they fail not to deceive themſelves. They are, ſay they, rich

and powerful, and raiſed in dignity. The Heathens and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> are not leſs. They have external marks, but who knows whether thoſe marks are good, and whether they do not abuſe themſelves in the Conſequence they pretend to draw from them? They aſſure you that they do not deceive themſelves, they condemn you if you do not believe that which they believe; and they live, as to themſelves, in a perfect peace of mind. But the Author of thoſe Prejudices has taught us to anſwer, <hi>That all thoſe who compoſe other Societies, appear to have the ſame aſſurance with us that they are in the Truth, they do not condemn the Latins with leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, than the Latins condemn them with, they are not leſs exempt from the fear of deceiving themſelves, they live alſo in as great a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Des Prejugez Chap.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Peace and Tranquillity. That aſſurance alſo, and that confidence, that freedom from trouble and fear, that Peace and that Tranquillity grounded upon the belief that they are in the right way, and that they walk after their Light, are marks ſo ambiguous and ſo deceitful, that they may be found moſt frequently to be joyned infinitely more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with Errour, and the way of Hell, than with Truth and the way of Salvation.</hi> Theſe are the very words of the Author of thoſe Prejudices, whereof we change only the Application. But, ſay they, yet farther, Do you not believe that the Latin Prelates have a more clear light than you? We cannot know any thing by that, and they do not know anything themſelves from thence, ſince no perſon can make himſelf certain by his own light, according to the Author of Prejudices.</p>
               <p>They may from thence methinks ſee of what Nature that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is, but they will be more apt to be diſtaſted with it, if they will but conſider that their Principle tends to confound all Religion, and to render the very exiſtence of a Deity ſuſpected. For if there be nothing of certainty in thoſe Judgments that we make by our own light, why do we follow the Chriſtian Religion, more than the <hi>Pagan</hi> or the <hi>Mahometan?</hi> Is it becauſe that the Church has bid us do ſo? This is but a very bad reaſon, for the Church would never tell us that its Religion was bad, when it would be ſo in effect; there is no Society whatſoever, but would ſay that its Religion was good, and better than all others. Is it becauſe our Birth, our Education, Intereſt, Reputation, or the the friendſhip that we have with ſome perſons, or the Laws of the Country wherein we are, will not ſuffer us to embrace any other Religion, and ſuch-like motives that engage us? Theſe are yet but the very worſt Reaſons, and thoſe who are not Chriſtians
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97749:68"/>
but from thence, though poſſibly they may not be a ſmall number, may ſay, that they are not at all ſuch: for if thoſe very tyes had been applyed to <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> they would have been <hi>Pagans,</hi> as they are now Chriſtians. How then ought we to be Chriſtians? It is neceſſary that we ſhould be ſo from out of a Love, and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Religion it ſelf. But that Love and that Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be the effects of our own Light, and not of that of other men, and our own light ought to dictate to us what is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of God, and to make us approve of, and love it, under that quality. Should we then have nothing of certainty in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? ſhould we be always in doubt, under a pretence that our Light might deceive us? and thoſe admirable effects that Religion produces in our ſouls, <hi>that confidence, quiet, joy, that tranquillity, hope, freedom from trouble, and from fear, would they be nothing but ambiguous and deceitful marks, which are moſt frequently to be found more joyned with error and the way of Hell, then with the Truth and way of ſalvation?</hi> thither it is that that Principle of the Author of thoſe Prejudices leads us. Beſides, how do we come to believe there is a God? Is it becauſe the Church tells us ſo? That would be a very ill reaſon, for we believe on the contrary, that there is a Church, but by the belief that we have that there is a God; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it without doubt by the impreſſion of a thouſand Characters of the Deity in our minds, and on our hearts, that appearin the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the World, in his Government, or his ordering the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of it, and particularly in man himſelf, and in his moſt pure and moſt natural inclinations. Our Reaſon it ſelf is a lively Image of it. But that impreſſion is wrought but by our own Eyes, which make us ſee a Deity in things, it is not by others Eyes that we ſee it, but by our own. Is it neceſſary then that we ſhould doubt whether there be a God or not? Muſt we never be certain, becauſe our Eyes deceive us ſomtimes, and becauſe we are not Infallible?</p>
               <p>The Author of the <hi>Prejudices</hi> will ſay, without doubt, That we urge his Principle too farr, that he never pretended to ſhew, that we could not be aſſured by our own light, without the Authority of the Church, that there was a God, and that the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in oppoſition to that Religion which the <hi>Jews</hi> now profeſs, or to all thoſe Fantaſtick Religions that reign in the World, and are the meer effects of the impoſtures and humours of men, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be the true Religion; <hi>That that diſcernment is not hard to be made the advantage of the Chriſtian Religion, above all thoſe others, being moſt clear and manifeſt.</hi> Indeed ſo he has explained himſelf
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97749:69"/>
from the very beginning of his Preface: whence it appears, that he would not hinder the examination of the matters of Religion, but when particular controverſies that divide the divers Sects of Chriſtians ſhall be treated of.</p>
               <p>I may ſay then, if I am not miſtaken, That there are two parts in his Hypotheſis, that in the firſt, he yields to every one a liberty to judg by his own Light of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, and that he does not take away from them in that reſpect the certainty of their Judgments, but that in the ſecond, he takes it from them over other particular matters; but all that is but an Artifice whereby he would prevent and elude, if he could, thoſe juſt and natural Conſequences which he foreſaw might be drawn from his Principle. For the very ſame Reaſons which he propoſes to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from the examining the particular points of Religion, and the very ſame grounds upon which he builds his Concluſion, have place alſo in the comparing the Chriſtian Religion with other Religions. So that one may ſay, that the ſecond part of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign deſtroys the firſt, and that he himſelf overthrows that that he had eſtabliſht. For, tell me, if the uncertainty of our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments founded upon this, that we ſee that others deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the darkneſs of our underſtanding, by our Prejudices, by our Paſſions, and by thoſe ſecret Attacks that we have of our thoughts, tell me, if that has not place as well in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they make, That there is a God, and that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion is alone from God, and the only True one, as in that, that we make, That their Purgatory is but an imaginary Fire, that their Tranſubſtantiation is but a human invention, and that the Sacrifice of the Maſs is no where to be found in the Scripture? Are there no Profane or Atheiſtical perſons in the World? Are there no <hi>Jews,</hi> nor <hi>Pagans,</hi> nor <hi>Mahometans?</hi> As we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that they deceive themſelves, ſo are they perſuaded that we deceive our ſelves: but may not they demand of us, what aſſurance we have that the darkneſs of our Underſtandings, our Prejudices, our Paſſions, or ſome other ſecret tye that lyes upon our thoughts have no part in our perſuaſion? What will the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the <hi>Prejudices</hi> anſwer to them? Will he ſay, <hi>That the advantage that the Chriſtian Religion has over all other Religions is moſt clear and manifeſt?</hi> I may ſay to him the ſame, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that the Proteſtant Religion has above the <hi>Roman,</hi> is moſt clear and manifeſt; and in ſaying ſo, I ſhall affirm nothing whereof I am not well convinced. If he replies to me, that I
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97749:69"/>
ought not to be ſo confident of my own Light, that that which appears to me to be moſt clear and manifeſt, does not appear ſo to others, that the darkneſs of the Mind, Prejudices, Paſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make men deceive themſelves, and that I have no aſſurance that I am not of that number. The <hi>Jew,</hi> the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> the <hi>Pagan,</hi> the <hi>Libertine,</hi> the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> who ſhall come behind him, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, as often as they ſhall have occaſion, after the ſame manner. This is juſtly what we have to ſay, this Author pleads our cauſe admirably well.</p>
               <p>After all, That Principle of the Author of thoſe <hi>Prejudices</hi> was ſo far from turning aſide our Fathers from examining by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the matters of Religion, that on the contrary it bound them to do it the more. For being concerned for their own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was no perſon more intreſted than themſelves, and being ſo eaſily apt to deceive themſelves in the choice of thoſe Opinions that they were enjoyned to believe, and of that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which they were to practiſe, they ought not naturally to have truſted any but themſelves. They might, it is true deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but their Prelates might deceive themſelves as well as they, and if in the Church the people muſt refer themſelves to their Prelates, and each of thoſe Prelates in particular muſt refer themſelves to the whole body of the Church, they will find that neither the one nor the other will be cured, and that that Church to which they ſhould all refer themſelves, would be but an <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> as they ſpeak in the Schools, and a Platonic Idea. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then bound our Fathers to examine that which they ſhould know, both from the imperfections of the Minds or the Hearts of men, and from the examples of thoſe before them who fell into error, together with the danger which men are in, on the account of their Prejudices, their Paſſions, and their Intereſts; all that could produce no other effect in them than to excite them to make an examination the moſt exactly and diligently that it was poſſible for them to do, cleanſing their Hearts from every evil thought, and imploring the Grace and Bleſſing of God upon them: For they were aſſured, that if they did the Will of the Father, they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>James</hi> 1.</note> ſhould know his true Doctrine, and that if any did lack Wiſdom, &amp; begg'd it of God, that he would give it them, ſince he gives to all liberally and upbraideth not. Thoſe are the promiſes of the Goſpel. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe to whom God grants that Grace which inlightens the mind and opens the Heart, do not only, not deceive themſelves in the choice of Saving Doctrines, and in the rejecting of thoſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97749:70"/>
that are Damnable; but they have for that all the aſſurance that they can reaſonably wiſh for: for the Truth makes it ſelf to be perceived by far other Characters than thoſe of a diſguiſed falſhood. The Invocation of Saints, the Worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the Adoration of the Hoſt, the Conceit of Purgatory, have never produced in the ſouls of the Devout Perſons of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſweet joy, that Peace, and that Contentment of the Soul, which the Proteſtant rejoyces in, when he calls upon God alone, when he Worſhips him without Images, as he has comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, when he Adores Jeſus Chriſt ſitting at the Right Hand of his Father, and when he places his only Confidence in his Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and in his Merit; a deceived Conſcience may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Security; but that ſecurity is never enjoyed like a true Quiet. It is the Reſt of a Lethargy where a mans feels no pain, becauſe he has no feeling, which is very different from that Reſt that gives a perfect Health: beſides that, the ſecurity of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Conſcience is not long continued, inquietudes return from time to time, chiefly in the Affections, and at the time of Death, where that Tranquillity that the True Religion gives, is ſolid and well grounded, and diſplays its vertue peculiarly in the moſt grievous Accidents of our Life, and in the very Agonies of Death it ſelf: Such are thoſe Divine impreſſions that <hi>David</hi> felt, when he ſaid, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, Converting the ſoul: the Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple; The ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi>

But from thence it manifeſtly follows, that they had a right to Reform themſelves. For ſince they could examine only in order to diſcern the good from the bad, and the true from the falſe, who can doubt, that they having a right to make that diſcernment,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97749:71"/>
would not alſo have had a right to reject that which they ſhould have found to have been contrary to, or alienated from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, which is preciſely that which is called Reformation. I acknowledge that it yet remains to be inquired into, whether thoſe things which they have rejected are indeed Errors and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitons, as they are pretended to be, and whether they did not deceive themſelves in the Judgment that they made. But who ſees it not neceſſary, for the deciding of that Queſtion, to go to the bottom, and to enter upon that diſcuſſion which our Adverſaries would avoid? From whence it may appear, as I have ſaid in the beginning, that all that Controverſy which they raiſe againſt us about the Call of our Reformers, is nothing elſe but a vain amuſement; and that to make a good Judgment of that Action of our Fathers, and to know whether it be juſt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, we ought always to come to the bottom of the cauſe, and to thoſe things themſelves which are Reformed, for upon that the Queſtion doth wholly depend, whether they did well or ill.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding to ſhew that we would forget nothing that may ſerve for our Juſtification, and that after the deſire to pleaſe God, we have not a greater then that of approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves to our Country-men, and in general to all men, we ſhall not fail to make yet ſome particular Reflexions upon the Circumſtances of the Reformation, which will more and more confirm the right of our Fathers, and manifeſt the Juſtice of their Conduct, and at the ſame time we ſhall anſwer to ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the Author of the Prejudices. That ſhall be the buſineſs of this Second Part.</p>
               <p>Our firſt Reflexion ſhall be, on that deplorable State of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church in the days of our Fathers, in reſpect of its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats; for its Condition was ſuch, that there was no more hope of ever ſeeing a good Reformation to ſpring up by their Miniſtry. In effect, what could be expected from a Body that had almoſt wholly abandoned the care of Religion, and of the Salvation of Souls, (which was plunged in the intrigues and intereſts of the World) which kept the People in the ignorance of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel, and in the moſt groſs Superſtitions, and with which (the whole body) it ſelf did entertain it ſelf, and was found to be poſſeſt by Ambition, by Luxury, and by Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and engaged in the vileſt manners, and living in almoſt a general oppoſition to overthrow of all Diſcipline?

                     <hi>Onus Eccleſ.</hi> Cap. 20. Sect. 2.</note> near the very time of the Reformation, but one who was no ways <hi>Luthers</hi> friend, as it appears by his writings. <hi>I am afraid,</hi> ſays he, <hi>That the Doctrine of the Apoſtle touching the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Biſhop is but very ill obſerved in theſe days, or rather that we are fallen into thoſe Times, which he noted, when he ſaid, <q>I know that after my departure, ravenous Wolves will come among you, not ſparing the flock:</q>
                  </hi> Where may one ſee a good man choſen to be a Biſhop? one approved by his works and his Learning, and any one who is not either a Child, or Worldly or Ignorant of ſpiritual things? The far greater number come to the Prelateſhip more by underhand canvaſſings, and ill ways, then by Election and lawful ways. That Diſorder which may be ſeen in the Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, ſets the Church in danger of periſhing; <hi>for</hi> Solomon <hi>ſays, </hi>
                  <q> 
                     <hi>There is one evil which I have ſeen under the Sun, as an Error which proceedeth from the Ruler, when a fool is raiſed to high dignity.</hi>
                  </q> It is therefore that I ſaid, that the Biſhops ought to excel in Learning, to the end that by their Inſtructions and their Preaching they might govern others profitably. But alas! What Biſhop have we now a days that Preaches, or has any care of the Souls committed to him? There are, beſides that, very few who are <note place="margin">

                  <hi>contented with one Spouſe alone, that is to ſay, with one only Church, and who ſeek not to appropriate to themſelves more Dignities, more Prebends, and what is yet more to be condemned, more Biſhopricks. Our Biſhops are feaſting at their own Tables then when they ſhould be at the Altar, they are unwiſe in the things of God, but they love the wiſdom of the World, they are more intent on Temporal Affairs,</hi> ſay it may be, that I ſuffer my ſelf to be carried away by my Paſſion, and that all theſe clamourous Accuſations are but the effect of that Engagement in which we all are ſet againſt the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But to leave no ground for that Suſpicion, beſides what I have ſet down in general in the ſecond Chapters of my firſt Part, I will further produce here more particular Teſtimonies of that Truth, by applying them to the Ages of our Fathers. I will ſay nothing of my own head, I will make their Authors that are not ſuſpected by them, to ſpeak, whoſe paſſages I will faithfully relate, which they may ſee in the Originals if they will take the pains. And as I hope that they will not lay to my charge what may appear to be too vehement in their Expreſſions, ſo alſo I not do pretend to impute to the Prelats of theſe days, that which thoſe Authors cenſured in thoſe of the former Times.</p>

                  <hi>then on the work of Jeſus Chriſt. Their Bodies are adorned with Gold, and their Souls defiled with filth, they are aſhamed to meddle with Spiritual things, and their glory lies in their Scurrilous humor and carriage. Whence it was that</hi> Catherine <hi>of</hi> Sienna <hi>told them, that in the blindneſs wherein they were, they placed their glory in that which was truly their ſhame, and that on the contrary they held thoſe things to be a reproach to them whereon their honour and Salvation did depend; to wit, in humbling themſelves under their Head, which was God. Furthermore they have no love for any but ſinners they deſpiſe the poor, and howſoever the Canons forbid them they keep about their perſons Pimps, debauchers of Women, Flatterers, Buffoons, Players, where they ſhould have had wiſe and holy men.—In fine, inſtead of the Law of Truth, the Law of Vanity is in the mouths of the Biſhops, and the lips of the Prieſts preſerve knowledge, but it is that of the World, and not of the Spirit.</hi> And a little after, <hi>At preſent,</hi> ſays he, <note place="margin">

Alas, the Lord Jeſus ſaid plainly that his Kingdom was not of this World, he retired himſelf alone into a Mountain, when he knew that they went about to make him a King. How then is it that he who holds the place of Jeſus Chriſt, not only accepts Dominion, but ſeeks it; and that he whom Jeſus Chriſt has taught to be meek and lowly in heart, ſhould reign in pleaſures, in luxury, in violence, in pride, in haughtineſs in riches and in rapines?</hi> And yet a little after, <hi>The Biſhops have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Hoſpitality, they neglect the poor of Jeſus Chriſt, but they</hi>

                  <hi>there are very few Elections that are Cononically made, and without under hand canvaſſings; on the contrary, the greateſt parts of the Prelats and Beneficed men, are made by Kings and Princes in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful manner, and which is more, being brought in by Canvaſſings and Simony, they are confirmed by the</hi> Popes, <hi>againſt the Priviledges of the Churches, and the Statutes of</hi> Germany, <hi>and againſt all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Juſtice. Furthermore the Biſhops ordinarily promote to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and the Cure of Souls, their Cooks, their Collectors of their Tribute, their Penſionaries, the Grooms of their Stables: Hence</hi> Ubertine <hi>ſaid, That the Antient Holineſs of the Prelats waſted away by degrees, and that it began to fall by Canvaſſings, by Pomp, and by Simony, by unlawful Elections, by Covetouſneſs, and by the abundance and ſuperfluity of Temporal things, by the promotions that the Biſhops made of their Creatures, by neglecting the Divine-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and by other perverſe works; and that by Reaſon of thoſe ill diſpoſitions, the Devil was let looſe againſt the preſent State of the Church.—Now, none of them who are called to the Paſtors Charge and the Cure of Souls inform themſelves either of the quality of their Flock, or of their manners, or their vices. Not one Prelate called to the Government of a Monaſtery will take the pains to Obſerve either its Rules, or the Order of its Ceremonies, or the Diſcipline of the Religious, there is not wholly any more mention made of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Edification of thoſe that are under them, but they only inform themſelves very exactly of the plenty of their Revenues, and what ſuch a Benefice may bring in Yearly, though yet they do not reſide there. It is theſe Curates that</hi> Vincentius <hi>cri'd out upon, when he ſaid, O what Obduration is there in the Church of God! The Prelats are Proud, Vain, Sumptuous, Simoniſts, Covetous, Luxurious Men, that regard only this Earth. They neglect their Eccleſiaſtical Duties, they are void of Charity, Intemperate, Lazy. For they neither perform Divine Offices, nor Preach, and do nothing but what creates Scandal. They deſpiſe the foreſight of their Holy Mother the Church, which ordains that when the Rectors of Churches ſhall not be able to</hi>

But on the contrary the Prelats and Curates are only careful to put into their places, men that are very well skilled, not to feed the ſheep, but to poll them, to deſtroy, and flea them.</hi> He goes on with that vehemency throughout a large Chapter, where he relates the many complaints of the Abbot <hi>Joachim,</hi> Saint <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Sienna,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Brigitt;</hi> Behold <note place="margin">Ibid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The Revenues of the Church are given, not to the Servants of God, but to thoſe of the Devil, to the Debauchers of Women, to Adulterers, Gameſters, Hunters, Flatterers, and ſuch like men, and hence alſo it is that the houſe of God is become Tributary to the Devil. The Abbot who ought never to be out of his Monaſtery, but to be the head and example to the reſt of the Religious, is become the head of a whole Troop of leud Women, with their Trains of Baſtards: inſtead of being an Example to and feeder of, the poor, he makes himſelf Maſter of their Alms, and he may be ſeen far oftner in the field with the Souldiers, then in his Cloiſter. He ought to be the Father and the Inſtructer of his Brethren, but he is their Seducer, and their Tyrant. For while he enjoys himſelf, and lives in Pomp and Delights, thoſe poor miſerable Religious, paſs away all their days in murmurings and afflictions.</hi> That Author deſcribes in the ſame Stile the Lives of the Canons, Monks and other Eccleſiaſticks, and that which he has ſaid does not leave us any more room to doubt that there was in the Church in thoſe days, as great and as general a diſorder as can be conceived.</p>

               <p>The diſorder of that Court, and that of the whole Clergy of thoſe times was a thing ſo little to be conteſted, that <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth did not ſcruple to acknowledge it in the Memoirs that he gave his <hi>Nuntio</hi> for the Diet of <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> and which <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldus</hi> Relates.

                  <hi>of the Separation,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was the open abuſe of Indulgences, and the Ignorance, Covetouſneſs, and the Scandalous lives of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

The Tyranny that Parents exerciſed over their Children to impriſon them in Cloiſters; the wickedneſs of thoſe who contrived falſe Miracles, to draw to themſelves the concourſe of the People. Add</hi>

                  <hi>to that, Politick humane Conſiderations of ſome Princes and Kings, who had not received from the</hi> Pope <hi>all poſſible Satisfaction, or who took occaſion from thence to caſt themſelves among a Party of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted men, the better to Eſtabliſh their affairs; in brief, all that which Ignorance, Superſtition and Covetouſneſs could Contribute, ſerved for a pretence to thoſe who would ſeparate themſelves to Reform thoſe Diſorders. The Ground was not only ſpecious, but it had been in a manner accompanied with Truth, if the Church in thoſe days had been throughout in that miſerable condition, which we have deſcribed, and principally ſo in thoſe places wherein that deteſtable Separation began. Thoſe who ſeparated were aided indirectly by the zeal of ſome good men, who cried out loudly againſt thoſe diſorders, abuſes, and corruptions of manners. The people who judged no otherwiſe then by the appearance ſuffered themſelves to be eaſily carried away with that Torrent, ſeeing that they did not complain but of thoſe things which they knew were but too true, and which the better ſort of Catholicks granted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold then in what a condition the Church was in thoſe days, and we may from thence, methinks ask all rational perſons, whither they believe in good earneſt, that our Fathers ought to have expected a Reformation from the hands of a Clergy, which on the one ſide had ſo many worldly intereſts that bound them to oppoſe it, and which on the other found it ſelf ſo deeply ſunk into Ignorance, Superſtition, and Corruption.</p>
               <p>But to urge that matter yet further, we need but to ſet down thoſe juſt complaints which they had made for a long time touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe diſorders, and the continual demand that all the World made for a good Reformation, at leaſt in reſpect of manners, of Diſcipline, and thoſe moſt groſs abuſes, without ever being able to obtain it. I paſs by the complaints of the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries, which would be but too great, if they were compared, with thoſe juſt grounds that all honeſt men in thoſe days had for them. For thoſe two Centuries were famous for wickedneſs, (grievous) crimes, and thoſe who know any thing of Hiſtory cannot deny it. But, not to go ſo far, not to ſay any thing either of the Scandalous Lives of the <hi>Popes</hi> of that Time, or the Wars wherewith they filled all the Weſt, or of the Abuſes they committed in their Excommunications, or of the Baptizing of Bells: Wherewith they increaſed the Eccleſiaſtical Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or of the vices which reigned then throughout all the Clergy, can they tell us what good effect thoſe ſmart Cenſures of Saint

                  <hi>to the Clergy,</hi> They are not in Trouble as other men. <hi>For every order of men has its Labours and its pleaſures, but I admire,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the wiſdom of our Clergy, who have choſen all the pleaſures for themſelves, and rejected the Labour. They are as proud as Souldiers, they have as great a train of Servants as they, and of Horſes, and Birds, and they live as merrily as they. They are arrayed like women with skins of great value, they have rich Bids, Baths, and all the Allurements of ſoft delights. But they take great heed leaſt they put on a Breaſt-plate with the Souldiers, or paſs away the nights in the Field, or to expoſe themſelves to Battels, and yet they take leſs heed to keep Modeſty and the Laws of Decency, which are proper to women, and to labour ſo</hi>

                  <hi>much as they do. At the Reſurrection then, when men ſhall ariſe every one in his own order, what place do you imagine thoſe men will find? The Souldier will not own them, for they took no part with them in their Labours, nor in their dangers. The Labourers and Dreſſers of the Vineyard will not any more for the ſame Reaſon. What then can they look for? But to be driven from and accuſed by all Orders, and to go into thoſe places where there is no Order, but where Everlaſting horrour Dwels.</hi> Has it been amended ſince <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mande</hi> wrote theſe words, <hi>Alas! the Churches are reduced to that Condition, that when they come to be vacant, one can hardly find any perſons fit to be choſen to ſucceed. And if ſometimes, which rarely happens, there be found ſome good Man hid as a Lilly among the Thorns, the Number of the wicked and uncapable, exceeds ſo much, that they will never let a good man be choſen Prelate; but crying up ſuch as themſelves they chuſe men after their own hearts, to the Ruin of the Church, and the people that are under them. Elſe if the greater part in the Church were good, the Elections would be made by the Majority of voices, and they would be good and Canonical, for thoſe that would chuſe for God, would be the far greater number then thoſe who ſhould chuſe for the Devil. But in theſe days it is quite the contrary. It is the Faſhion, that there muſt be more wicked then good, ſo that uſually, the Elections are rather Diabolical then Canonical, and not made by the inſpiration of the Holy Spirit, but by a Conſpiracy, or Treacherous Machination.</hi> All theſe Complaints were to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the evil was too general, and too inveterate to be ſtopt or remedied.</p>
               <p>In the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> all thoſe Nations who liv'd under the diſorders of a long and obſtinate Schiſme, propounded ſome Articles to Reform as well <hi>the Head as the Members,</hi> and correct the ill manners of the Church.

                  <hi>had already laſted four years to the great damage of the Biſhops and the Churches, That it was needful to turn over that buſineſs to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time, and that that Affair deſerved to be thought on more leiſurely; becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>according to St.</hi> Jerome, <hi>every Province has its Maxims, and its opinions which cannot be changed without ſtirring up great Troubles.</hi> As if Juſtice, Piety, Holineſs, and good Diſcipline, were not the ſame among all people and in every Countrey.</p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> aſſembled ſome Time after, with a deſign to proceed to a Reformation of the Head and the Members;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97749:75"/>
A Declaration was made very Solemnly that there the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and their firſt Acts ſhould contain no other thing. But when they would have meddled with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Popes</hi> Soveraign Authority, every one knows after what manner <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> the Fourth exalted himſelf againſt them, and what endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he uſed to ſeparate them, or at leaſt to render their deſigns unprofitable. That produced new Troubles, and new diſorders, and caſt the <hi>Latin</hi> Church into a new ſchiſm. For that Council declaring its right, depoſed <hi>Pope Eugenius,</hi> and choſe <hi>Amadeus</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> but all that came to nothing. For <hi>Eugenius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Maſter, <hi>Amadeus</hi> was at length conſtrained to renounce the <hi>Papacy.</hi> The Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> and all its good deſigns, were brought to nothing, and things remained in the ſame State in which they were before. Which made an Author in thoſe Times ſay, <hi>That there could not be any thing expected from thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided</hi>

                  <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>the Mother and Root of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church, was every day more and more deſpiſed, that Luxury reigned in the Clergy, and that it was extream among the people. That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of Saint</hi> Peter <hi>was waſted, That Chriſtian Princes, animated with a mortal hatred one againſt another, were juſt ready to deſtroy one another, and that in fine, to make uſe of the words of</hi> Jeremy, <hi>One deſolation called to another, which made him to weep over the Church, and ſay to it, Daughter of Sion thy Deſolation is great as</hi>

                  <hi>the ſtretching out of the Sea; who is it that will bring thee any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy?</hi> After having repreſented thoſe things, he adds, <hi>That although the affliction of the Church was exceeding great, yet they might notwithſtanding mitigate it, if laying aſide their own paſſions, their Canvaſſings, and their Cabals, they would look to nothing elſe in chuſing a</hi> Pope, <hi>but Holineſs, Learning, and Fitneſs, or Capacity. That the Eyes of all the Church were upon them, to beg of them a</hi> Pope <hi>who might by the good odor of his Name allure the Faithful people to Salvation.</hi> He urged that diſcourſe much farther, in ſhewing them the neceſſity that the Church ſtood in of a Holy man, whoſe life ſhould be without reproach. He added to his Exhortations, threatnings on Gods part, and paſſed by nothing that might move the minds of thoſe Cardinals to do ſome good. Will you not ſay that words ſo weighty and ſo pungent ought to have made ſome Impreſſion on the minds of thoſe Cardinals, and that, at leaſt for that Time, they ſhould have done well? They ſaw the whole Church in diſorder, the Conqueſts that the Infidels made, Chriſtian Princes in Arms one againſt another, Church-Diſcipline overthrown, the lives of the Clergy profuſe, Piety violently beat down, and Chriſtianity degenerated in all places, could any one imagine that ſuch ſad repreſentations would not have been conſidered? But be not haſty, All the effect that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced was the Creation of <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth. That Name alone, ſufficiently Celebrated in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Popes,</hi> was enough to make men underſtand of what diſpoſition thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats were, and how little they were touched with the wounds of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church. Let us hear nevertheleſs what <hi>Raynaldus</hi> ſays, who in theſe kind of things is an Author that can no ways be ſuſpected. <hi>The greateſt part of the Cardinals,</hi> ſays he, <hi>were very remote from thoſe good Counſels: for Authors complain that ſome corrupted with Money, others gained by promiſes of Benefices and Places, and others drawn by the Conformity of a vitious and impure life, gave their Voices to</hi> Roderic Borgia. <hi>So that, in ſtead of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a chaſte man, they choſe one who was infamous for his unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and fornications, for which he had been reproved by</hi> Pius <hi>the Second, yet was ſo far from amending under that reproof, that he took no care to conceal his impurities. For on the contrary he lived with</hi> Vacoſia <hi>a Courtiſan of</hi> Rome, <hi>as if ſhe had been his real Wife, and he had divers Children by her, upon whom he heape'd Riches and Honors as much as it was poſſible for him to do, as if they had been his Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Children.</hi> Behold what the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was then.</p>

                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth being dead, and <hi>Pius</hi> the Third who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him having lived but thirty days after his Election, the Cardinals met again in the <hi>Conclave.</hi> And becauſe the Life and Government of <hi>Alexander</hi> had given ſcandal to all the World, and that the Cardinals themſelves had been but very ill ſatisfied with it, before they proceeded to an Election, they drew up ſome Articles, which every one ſwore to obſerve upon condition the Nomination ſhould fall upon him; and there was one among the reſt which carried this with it, That the new <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould call at the end of two years a General Council for the Reformation of the Church <hi>in its Head and its Members. Julius</hi> the Second was <note place="margin">Vide Raynalud in Jul.</note> choſen, but he did not believe himſelf bound to keep his Oath, for ſeven years paſt away without any thing being talkt either of a Council or a Reformation. And therefore it was that this <hi>Pope</hi> thought the leſs of it. Nevertheleſs it fell out, that, having ill Treated one party of the Colledge of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and having moreover ſtired up the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth the King of <hi>France</hi> againſt him, thoſe two great Princes joyned with the diſgraced Cardinals, and called a Council at <hi>Piſa.</hi> The Act of that Convocation, on the part of the Princes, ſays expreſly, that it was <hi>for the Extirpation of Hereſies and Errors, which through the negligence of Superiors had ſprung up in divers parts of the World, and particularly for the Reformation of the manners of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church in the Head and the Members, and for the amendment of many great, notorious, long continued, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible crimes, which had ſcandalized the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church.</hi> The Cardinals alſo alleaged the Oath that the <hi>Pope</hi> had took, juſt before his promotion, in theſe very words, <hi>I ſwear to obſerve and perform theſe Articles throughout, and in every particular, ſincerely, unfeignedly, ſeriouſly and in good earneſt, and under pain of falling under perjury and an Anathema, from which I cannot abſolve my ſelf, nor give power to any other perſon to abſolve me.</hi> They added to that, that by another Article they all, and <hi>Julius</hi> himſelf had ſworn, <hi>That if he who ſhould be choſen ſhould not perform his promiſe in good earneſt, he ſhould be held guilty of perjury, to be a breaker of his Vow and of his Faith, a diſturber of the Church, and the cauſe of Scandal to all Chriſtianity, and that then two thirds of the Sacred Colledge ſhould have power to aſſemble a General Council.</hi> The Council then being aſſembled, declared openly, <hi>That there was a moſt evident neceſſity of Reforming the Church in the Head and the Members;</hi> and made a Decree formed in theſe words, <hi>The Holy and ſacred</hi>

                  <hi>General Synod of</hi> Piſa, <hi>lawfully called in the name of the Holy Ghoſt, compoſing a General Council, and repreſenting the Catholick Church, doth define and declare, That that Holy Synod would not, nor could not, diſſolve it ſelf, till the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church ſhould be Reformed in Faith and Manners, as well in the Head as the Members, and till the Hereſies and Schiſms that had ſprung up ſhould be Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold, hitherto, the faireſt hope in the World. It is not neceſſary for us to inquire, whether that Reformation was the true Cauſe of the Calling of that Aſſembly together, or whether it was only a pretence, and according to all appearances it was the latter. But whatſoever it might be, whether a pretence or not, three thing reſult from it; the one, That that Reformation was generally judged to be moſt neceſſary; the other, That it was extreamly deſired by the people, for they would never have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to have took up thoſe things for a pretence which did not appear neceſſary, and which were not wiſht for; and the Third is, That a Reformation ſo neceſſary and ſo much deſired ſhould extend it ſelf to Faith as well as to Manners, <hi>even,</hi> ſay they, <hi>'till the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church ſhould be Reformed in Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See then what was the ſucceſs of ſo weighty a buſineſs. <hi>Julius</hi> on his ſide, who according to the general mind of the <hi>Popes,</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hated thoſe Propoſitions of a Reformation, diſplay'd all the Authority, Force, and Artifice that he had to elude that Council, and to turn all thoſe projects into Air. And firſt of all, he made void and diſanull'd that Convocation that had been called, he declared them the Authors of Schiſme, and Rebellion, as <hi>Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and their Council, a <hi>Conventicle</hi> of <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> a <hi>Synagogue</hi> of Satan, and a Church of <hi>Malignants,</hi> he forbad all Prelats to go thither under pain of <hi>Anathema,</hi> and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated all thoſe who ſhould afford them any help or aſſiſtance di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly, and in fine, he interdicted the Towns and Churches that ſhould receive them. But as that way of Authority alone could not produce the effect which he deſired, ſince the World did not care always to be frightned with the <hi>Papal</hi> Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo it was neceſſary for him further to elude that pretence of a Reformation which thoſe of <hi>Piſa</hi> had taken up. He then had recourſe to that Ordinary Artifice of the <hi>Popes,</hi> which is, that when they cannot longer avoid a Council, they labour to make themſelves Maſters of it, to the end that nothing may paſs there
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97749:77"/>
but what agrees with their Intereſts and their deſires. For this Reaſon he called he called one at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, and to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more ſure, taking up as well as his Adverſaries that pretence of the Reformation of the Church; the better to colour his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and to ſtrengthen his Party, he created ſome new <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</hi> Nevertheleſs as he would not omit any thing, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Arms, he made a League with <hi>Spain</hi> againſt <hi>France,</hi> he aſſaulted <hi>Ferrara</hi> that was held by the <hi>French,</hi> he went himſelf in Perſon into his Army, he filled all <hi>Italy</hi> with War, he drew the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> to his Intereſts, he gave Battels, he Excommunicated the King of <hi>France</hi> and all his Confederates, and after having got off the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> from them, he gave away their Kingdoms to him who ſhould firſt Conquer them, and in fine he ſet up his <hi>Conventicle</hi> at <hi>Lateran,</hi> where he and his Succeſſour <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth made all things paſs that they would have. I ſay, he and his Succeſſour <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, For <hi>Julius</hi> dy'd after the fifth Seſſion, and <hi>Leo</hi> not being yet thirty ſeven years Old was choſen in his place, by the Faction of the young <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> againſt the mind of the elder ſort, by Reaſon of which <hi>Alphonſus Petrucius,</hi> a young <hi>Cardinal,</hi> having had it given him in charge to declare the new Election to the people, he did it in theſe words, <hi>We have choſen</hi> Leo <hi>the Tenth for our</hi> Pope, <hi>Let the young men live. Leo</hi> then, continued that Council, in which, in favour of ſome light Reformations which conſiſted but in words without any effect, he more then ever eſtabliſhed the Soveraign Authority of his See, and confirmed the Abuſes of his Court, and the diſorders of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church. For he there Solemnly made void the Pragmatick Function, which was almoſt the only good thing that remained in the Government of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, he there made the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> to be declared a <hi>Conventicle,</hi> and cauſed it to be determined, That the Authority of the <hi>Popes</hi> is above all Councils; which obliged the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> to reject that Decree, and to ſue forth an appeal made to a Council lawfully called.</p>
               <p>After this, I know not whether they can any farther ſay with any confidence, that our Fathers ought to entertain good hopes of the <hi>Latin,</hi> Prelats, and that they ought to have expected a good Reformation from their hands. All the World deſired that there ſhould be a Reformation in the Government of the Church, they impatiently demanded it, they themſelves acknowledged the neceſſity of it, <hi>in the Head and the Members,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97749:78"/>
engaged to do it by a Solemn Oath, but when it was urged to be put in Execution, he choſe rather to enflame all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then to deliberate to reform himſelf, and to re-eſtabliſh Order, and he managed his party ſo well, that he found a whole Council diſpoſed blindly to do whatſoever ſhould pleaſe him, without any regard had either of God or the Church, or of themſelves. Did not all that give a fair hope of a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>They will ſay, it may be, that <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth, Succeſſour to <hi>Leo,</hi> after having ingenuouſly confeſſed, in the Diet of <hi>Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> the diſorders of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of all the Prelats, as we have ſeen before, promiſed alſo to Reform them.

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Confirmation of the ſame thing, from the Hiſtory of that which paſſed in the Firſt Quarrels of</hi> Luther, <hi>with the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>concerning Indulgences.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt we ought to add ſomething to all that we have ſaid, that if ſo many publick Proofs will not be ſufficient to make that Concluſion, That there could not be any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation hoped for on the part of <hi>Rome</hi> and its Prelats; they may further ſee, if they will, ſomething more particular. Let us Examine after what manner they received the firſt complaints that <hi>Luther</hi> made againſt the Preachers of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and the Queſtors that <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth had ſent through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole extent of his Empire, and eſpecially into <hi>Germany,</hi> there to ſell publickly the Pardon of ſins, under a pretence of the building of the Church of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> but in effect, to have by that means, wherewithal to Enrich his Kindred, and ſatisfy his own profuſeneſs. The Hiſtory of that, which is as a Preamble to that of the Reformation of our Fathers, muſt needs give us a great deal of light to judge rightly of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and to decide the Juſtice or the Injuſtice of their Actions. See then well near how that buſineſs was managed. Beſides the manifeſt abuſe that there was in the uſing, and in the very Doctrine it ſelf of Indulgences, the Queſtors were conſtrained to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people every day divers Novelties upon that ſubject, to enhance their price and value before them, and they lived fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and guided themſelves in that affair after a very filthy and diſhoneſt manner. <hi>Luther</hi> who was then Profeſſour of Divinity in the Univerſity of <hi>Witenberg,</hi> thought himſelf bound by the duty of his Charge, and his Conſcience, to oppoſe himſelf to a Traffick ſo Miſchievous, and ſo deſtructive of true Piety. To effect that, he propoſed ſome <hi>Theſes</hi> for the clearing of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and wrote them to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> who was alſo Biſhop of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> beſeeching him to make uſe of his Authority to put a ſtop to thoſe exceſſes, and repreſenting to him, that it was the Duty of Biſhops throughly to inſtruct the people in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and not to ſuffer their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97749:79"/>
credulity to be ſo abuſed. He wrote alſo almoſt to the ſame ſence, to the Biſhop of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> under whoſe Dioceſs he was, and ſent him thoſe <hi>Theſes</hi> which he had framed on that Subject; with a more large Explication of them, which he added to them. He wrote the ſame to Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> he ſent him his Writings, he complained to him of the Follies that his Queſtors taught, and of the havock that they made, repoſing themſelves upon him, and abuſing his Authority; he cleared himſelf before him of the falſe imputations of his Adverſaries, and was ſo far from having any ways violated that reſpect which as yet he believed due to his Dignity and to his See, that he ſtooped even to exceſſive ſubmiſſions, which his Adverſaries did not fail to make uſe of in the end.</p>
               <p>Hitherto the moſt rigid Cenſurers cannot find any thing blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Conduct of <hi>Luther.</hi> For I pray tell me what could any one have done better? He beheld a ſort of men that diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured Religion, that made a mockery of the Devotion or rather of the ſuperſtition of the People, who were a ſcandal to the whole Church, who promoted falſe and deſtructive Maxims. He oppoſed himſelf to them, but of the duty of his place, he made his Complaints to thoſe, to whom ordinarily it belonged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thoſe exceſſes, he went even to the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the Miſchief that his Queſtors wrought. He begg'd of him to give Order about them, he uſed all the Terms of reſpect that the <hi>Pope</hi> could deſire. What can any find to blame in all that? They will ſay, it may be, that his Complaints againſt the Preachers of Indulgences were falſe, and ill-grounded. To clear this matter, we need but to ſee what his moſt fiery Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies wrote. <hi>Miltitus, the Apostolick Nuntio, ſays</hi> Ulembert, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Raynald. ad ann.</hi> 1918.</note> 
                  <hi>one of the moſt fiery Enemies of</hi> Luther, <hi>had ſufficiently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the Queſtors and Preachers of Indulgences, who had first given occaſion to</hi> Luther <hi>to oppoſe himſelf, were not altogether blameleſs. That therefore he had earneſtly reproved</hi> Tetzel (who was the Chief of the Queſtors) <hi>that he had not hindred thoſe abuſes that were intolerable to all honeſt men, and that grounding himſelf on the Authority of the</hi> Pope, <hi>he had done divers things of his own head, which could neither be approved of, nor defended; So that he had brought diſhonour on the Holy See, and given ground for a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous complaint, whereof he muſt one day give an account to the Pope.</hi> Florimund <hi>of</hi> Raymund <hi>acknowledged the ſame,</hi> that thoſe Queſtors committed moſt enormous Crimes, in Publiſhing their <note place="margin">Raynald. ubi ſupra.</note>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:97749:80"/>
Indulgences, and taking care for nothing elſe but to extort Money from the People. <hi>Belcair</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mets,</hi> ſaid, <hi>That the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Idem. ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Popes Miniſters was ſo great, that they made amongſt themſelves a publick Merchandiſe of Indulgences, ſometimes debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in the Taverns, they played them away, and at Dice, and other Games, eſpecially in Germany; and it was the common talk That the</hi> Pope <hi>had given away all the Money that ſhould be collected in ſome Countries of</hi> Germany <hi>to his ſiſter</hi> Magdalen. <hi>Guicchiardin</hi> goes ſo far as to blame the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, <hi>in that following the Counſel of Cardinal</hi> Peccius <hi>he had publiſhed the largeſt Indulgences, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſtinction of Places or Time, not only for the living, but to</hi>

                  <hi>draw Souls out of Purgatory alſo by means of his ſuffrage. That it was manifeſt, that he did that to extort Money from the People, and that thoſe who were employed to do it had bargained for the place, of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>by Reaſon of which the thing came to be turned into a publick Scandal, chiefly in</hi> Germany, <hi>where the greater part of thoſe Miniſters, ſold them at a cheap rate, or gamed away the power of delivering Souls out of Purgatory. He adds, That which rendred this Affair yet more odious, was the Donation that</hi> Leo <hi>had made, of a ſum of the Money that ſhould be raiſed by thoſe Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences to his ſiſter</hi> Magdalen, <hi>and the Commiſſion that was given for that to a certain Biſhop</hi> Archimbald, <hi>a man unworthy of ſuch an Employment, and who behaved himſelf with an extream Covetouſneſs and Rigour.</hi> Behold then two things indiſputable, as it ſeems to me; the one, That <hi>Luther</hi> had right at the Bottom, and that the buſineſs which gave him occaſion to ſpeak and write [againſt it] was filthy and ſcandalous in all reſpects; and the other is, That he guided himſelf after a moſt prudent and reſpectful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that had nothing in it of any diſorder.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee now, after what manner he was Treated. The firſt <note place="margin">See Sleidan, and the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Trent.</note> thing that fell out was, that neither the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> nor the Biſhop of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> vouchaſed to take any care to put a ſtop to thoſe abuſes that were committed. They know that afterwards the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mayence</hi> was himſelf concerned in a part of thoſe Indulgences, and that he got consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſums by them. The ſecond thing was, That <hi>Luther</hi> inſtantly raiſed againſt himſelf not only that whole ſwarm of Preachers and Queſtors, but the whole Empire of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that is to ſay, all the Creatures of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſpread abroad throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> who ſtirred up all their Endeavours to ruin him, raiſing againſt him the Princes and the People by many falſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97749:80"/>
imputations. <hi>Ecc us</hi> Doctor of Divinity, <hi>Silveſter Prierias,</hi> Maſter of the Sacred Palace at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>James Hockstraten</hi> Inquiſitor, wrote againſt him, the laſt of whom exhorted the <hi>Pope</hi> to make uſe of fire and Sword, for the Convincing of that Heretick. <hi>Luther</hi> defended himſelf againſt this ſort of men, by Publick Anſwers, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See thoſe pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the firſt Tome of</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Works.</hi>
                  </note> wherein he laid open their Abſurdities, and their falſe and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Aſſertions which they had propoſed: but he did yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways contain himſelf within the bounds of a great Reſpect for the <hi>Pope,</hi> and for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> holding, nevertheleſs, that they were not infallible, and that the Authority of a Council lawfully aſſembled was above that of the <hi>Pope;</hi> in which he ſaid nothing, that the Faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, does not ſay likewiſe. It appeared that it was their laſt intereſt that urged them to irritate <hi>Leo</hi> againſt him, and all his Court. Who, elſe, were not well contented with that which he had undertaken to put a ſtop to, or at leaſt, to trouble the courſe of their exactions.

                     <hi>See</hi> Sleidan <hi>the Hiſtory of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Paul, <hi>the firſt Tom, of the Works of</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Raynald.</note> Indulgences, and thoſe who defended them <hi>Luther</hi> was cited by the <hi>Pope,</hi> to appear in perſon at <hi>Rome</hi> to give an account of his writings, and his Conduct in that buſineſs, before the Judges that <hi>Leo</hi> had aſſigned to him, who were <hi>Jerome</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aſcoli;</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor of the Chamber, and <hi>Silveſter Prierias</hi> Maſter of the ſacred Palace. <hi>Leo</hi> wrote, at the ſame time, to <hi>Cajetan</hi> his Legat in <hi>Germany,</hi> a Letter full of Fire and Choler, againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> whom he treated as an Heretick and Seditious perſon, and gave him order to cauſe him to be ſeized as an Heretick, and conducted ſafely to <hi>Rome,</hi> commanding all Dukes, Marquiſes, Earls, Barons, and all Univerſities, Communities, and Powers, under pain of Excommunication, with a reſerve of the Emperour only, to uſe all their force to ſeize <hi>Luther,</hi> and to give him up into the hands of his Legat. He wrote alſo to the ſame purpoſe to <hi>Frederick</hi> the Elector of <hi>Saxony. Luther</hi> ſeeing ſo violent a proceeding againſt him, propoſed the Reaſons that hindred him from obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Citation, which were taken from the infirmity of his health, which would not permit him to expoſe himſelf to the weariſome toils of that Journey; from his povery, to which did not afford him wherewithal to do it; from the Tye that he had at the Univerſity of <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> from whence it was not in his power to depart without the conſent of his Prince; but more eſpecially from that evident oppreſſion which he ſuffered, in that he had
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97749:81"/>
the ſame perſon ordered to he his Judge, to wit, <hi>Sylveſter Prierias,</hi> who was, not only of the ſame Order with the Preachers of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, but the ſame perſon, who had immediately before wrote a Dialogue againſt him; ſo that it was viſibly to give him up into the hands of his Adverſaries, and the Parties themſelves. The Univerſity of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> wrote to <hi>Rome</hi> in his Favour, and the Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> having moſt earneſtly applyed himſelf to the Legat, obtained, in the end, with a great deal of difficulty, that the cauſe ſhould be tryed in <hi>Germany,</hi> and that for that buſineſs, <hi>Luther</hi> ſhould come and appear before the Legat at <hi>Auſpurg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although <hi>Luther</hi> could not be further ignorant, what Spirit the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all its Miniſters were animated with, as to himſelf, yet he did not fail notwithſtanding to appear before <hi>Cajetan;</hi> but it was after his friends had obtained a ſafe Conduct for him from the Emperour <hi>Maximilian. Cajetan</hi> was vext with ſuch a prevention, that broke all his meaſures, nevertheleſs he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Luther</hi> honeſtly enough, and propounded at firſt to him on the part of the <hi>Pope, To Recant, and to promiſe for the future, that he would not fall back again into his Errors, nor any more diſturb the Church.</hi> Luther anſwered, <hi>That his Conſcience did not accuſe him of any Error, that he entreated him to tell him in what he had Erred, and that he was ready either to juſtify himſelf, or yield him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be inſtructed. Cajetan</hi> then objected to him, as two great and fundamental Errors, That he had wrote, <hi>That the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt did not belong to the Treaſure of Indulgences, againſt the Extravagance of</hi> Clement <hi>the Sixth, and that Faith,</hi> that is to ſay, a firm belief of ones Juſtification, <hi>was neceſſary to thoſe who came to the Sacrament, and thoſe who ſhould appear before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; for on the contrary,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it is uncertain whether thoſe who draw near to God ſhall obtain his grace or not: Luther</hi> defended his Propoſitions, and the diſcourſe falling upon the Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> whom <hi>Cajetan</hi> affirmed to <hi>be above a Council, above the Scripture, and above all that was in the Church; Luther</hi> formally denyed it to him, and maintained, on the contrary, that the <hi>Pope</hi> was beneath the Scripture and a Council. The next morning <hi>Luther</hi> preſented to him a juſtification of his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in Writing, in which he inſerted a great many words full of reſpect to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the Legat himſelf in particular. But <hi>Cajetan,</hi> without being willing to hear him ſpeak of his juſtification, ſhut up all with this, That it
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97749:81"/>
was his pleaſure that he ſhould revoke his Errors, under pain of incurring the Cenſures, with which he had received Orders to puniſh him; adding, That if he would not recant, he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to withdraw himſelf, and to come no more before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> withdrew from the Legats Houſe, and having been advertiſed ſome days after, that they endeavoured to impriſon him, notwithſtanding the ſafe Conduct of the Emperour, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf from <hi>Auſpurg,</hi> not being ignorant of what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell <hi>John Hus</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> in the Council of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> Before his departure he wrote to <hi>Cajetan,</hi> two very ſubmiſſive <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luther Tome.</hi> 1.</note> Letters, in one of which he acknowledged that he had not in treating of that buſineſs of the Indulgences, preſerved all that reſpect which he ought to have had for the name of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and that howſoever he had been urged by the carriage of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, he confeſt, that nevertheleſs he ought to have handled that matter with more modeſty, humility, and reſpect; that if he had any ways diſpleaſed him, he beg'd his pardon, offering to publiſh it himſelf, and to uſe civiller Terms for the Future. He offered likewiſe not to ſpeak any more from thence forward of Indulgences, provided he impoſed ſilence on the Queſtors alſo, or obliged them to obſerve the ſame meaſures in their diſcourſes. And as to the Recantation which they required of him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that he had done it in good earneſt, if his Conſcience had allowed him to have done it, but that there was no command, nor Counſel, nor Conſideration of any perſon in the World, that could make him ſay, or do any thing againſt his Conſcience. In the ſecond Letter obſerving all along the ſame ſubmiſſive and reſpectful Stile, he declared to him, That he had withdrawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from <hi>Auſpurg,</hi> and beg'd that he would not think the worſe of him, if he appealed from him to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and at the ſame Time he ſent him his Act of Appeal. That Appeal was founded. 1. Upon this, That he had not determined any thing upon the point of Indulgences, but that he had only propoſed ſome <hi>Theſes</hi> to be diſputed on according to the Cuſtom of the Schools. 2. That the Opinions of the Doctors, as well Canoniſts as Divines, being very different, and there being nothing defined for certain in the Church upon that ſubject, he had had right to chuſe one ſide to chuſe one ſide to maintain in the diſpute, much more when he was urg'd to it by the indiſcretion of the Queſtors, who under a pretence of thoſe Indulgences had diſhonoured the Church of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97749:82"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> and the power of the Keys, by their deteſtable covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſcandalous Conduct, ſeducing the People unto new opinions and ſelling Juſtifying Grace for Money. 3. That he had not only ſubmitted his Diſputation to the Judgment of the Church, but even to the Judgment of every man more Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then himſelf, and in particular to Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> From whence he concludes that he had had no juſt Cauſe to Cite him. That nevertheleſs he had offered to his Legat to refer himſelf to the judgment of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Univerſities of <hi>Baſil,</hi> of <hi>Friburg,</hi> of <hi>Lovain,</hi> and of <hi>Paris;</hi> which his Legat would not accept. That he would not let him ſee wherein his Error lay; but that he had only preſſed him meerly to recant, threatning him if he did not, or if he did not go to <hi>Rome,</hi> he would Excommunicate him and all who adhered to him; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that he had always proteſted, that he had not any opinion but what was founded on the Scripture, on the Fathers, and the Canons. That therefore finding himſelf oppreſſed by that whole proceeding, he appeal'd from the Legat, and from all that the <hi>Pope,</hi> through ill Information, had done againſt him, to the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf better Informed. Notwithſtanding, he withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from <hi>Auſpurg,</hi> and by his retreat, rendred vain and ineffectual all the Conſpiracies they had contrived againſt his perſon, to make him a Priſoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cajetan</hi> having failed of his intent, Wrote to <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> accuſing him as guilty of a heinous Crime, in that he would not Recant; and further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted and required that Prince, either to ſend him to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to drive him out of his Territories. <hi>Luther</hi> very ſolidly juſtified himſelf before his Prince, and made him ſee the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and moſt evident Tyranny that they uſed againſt him. And becauſe that the Cardinal had formally declared in his Letter to <hi>Frederick,</hi> that ſo weighty and Peſtilentious an affair could not remain a long Time in that Condition, and that the Cauſe ſhould be carried on at <hi>Rome.</hi> That menace obliged <hi>Luther</hi> to make an Act of Appeal from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and from all his proceedings againſt him, to a Council lawfully called. At the ſame Time almoſt, <hi>Leo</hi> ſent a Bull into <hi>Germany</hi> confirming his Indulgences, and the Doctrine upon which they were grounded. That Doctrine was, <hi>That by the Power of the Keys given to Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>and to his Succeſſors, The Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>had a right to pardon to the Faithful all the guilt and puniſhments of their Actual Sins, to wit,</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:97749:82"/>
                  <hi>the guilt, by means of the Sacrament of Penance, and the temporal Puniſhment by means of Indulgences, whether in this Life, or in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and that by thoſe Indulgences he could apply to the Living and the Dead, the ſuperabundance of the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Saints, either by way of Abſolution, or by way of Suffrage, ſo that the Living and the Dead participating of thoſe Indulgences, were delivered from the Puniſhment that the Divine Juſtice would inſlict on them for their actual ſins.</hi> He commanded therein all under pain of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, from which they could not be abſolved till the point of Death to believe it alſo: and to the end no perſon might alledge ignorance, he gave Order to all Arch-Biſhops, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, by vertue of their Holy Obedience, to cauſe his Bull to be publiſhed in all their Churches, giving nevertheleſs power to his <hi>Legat</hi> to proceed againſt the diſobedient, and to puniſh them as he ſhould think fit.</p>
               <p>Behold here the true Hiſtory of the firſt Quarrel of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Luther!</hi> Let them judge now, whether our Fathers, under whoſe eyes all that buſineſs paſt, could any more hope for a Reformation either from the <hi>Popes</hi> hand or his <hi>Prelats.</hi> Inſtead of making a Holy and Chriſtian Reflexion, upon the juſt complaints of this man, how mean and contemptible ſoever he might appear to them, they thought of nothing but keeping up that evil, which they did, then in publiſhing their Indulgences, which they knew had not any Foundation, either in the Word of God, or in the Practiſe of the Primitive Church. They thought of nothing but how to protect them, and indirectly to forbid thoſe ſcandalous and wicked exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their Miniſters, inſtead of correcting them ſeverely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing them. They thought of nothing but their own Intereſt, and not to let ſlip any occaſion that might be offered to heap up money, without having any regard either of the Honour of the Chriſtian Religion, or of the Salvation of Souls. They thought of nothing but how to ſettle more and more the Soveraign and Monarchical Power of the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> where they ſhould have wholly applied themſelves to make Jeſus Chriſt Reign in the hearts of men. They thought of nothing elſe but putting a ſtop to the happy breakings out of thoſe firſt bright Beams of the Truth which came out of <hi>Luthers</hi> Mouth and Pen; where they ſhould have received them, and made uſe of them to obtain from God a further and greater Light. They made it a Fundamental matter, to get <hi>Luther</hi> to recant; and not being able to compaſs that, they thought of nothing but how to ruin him by all the ways they could
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97749:83"/>
uſe. They raiſed a ſtrife and proceſs about a matter of Faith, of Religion, and of Conſcience, and a proceſs that was unjuſt, and that could not be defended in the very Form of it. For what kind of proceeding was that, openly to cite a man to appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> who had done nothing but only propoſed ſome <hi>Theſes</hi> to diſpute of, on a matter upon which there had not yet been any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined? What manner of proceeding was it, to give him a party himſelf to be his Judge, and to declare him a Heretick before ever he had heard him, as the <hi>Pope</hi> did in his Letter to <hi>Cajetan,</hi> to ſtir up Kings, Princes, and the People againſt him, and to ſhew it was his mind to begin to Treat of ſo weighty a matter with his Impriſonment, without any regard had, either of the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he made, or of the Reaſons he alledged, or of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful Submiſſions towards the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Legat?</hi> Who may not ſee in all that, an inflexible Reſolution always to retain the Latin Church in that deplorable condition wherein it was found to be then, and even to make its Yoak heavier, if it had been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible? So far were they from having any deſign to Reform it, and to free it from thoſe Enemies and Superſtitions under which it groaned.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant, that ſome way to excuſe ſo violent a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, one has ſaid, That almoſt at the ſame time wherein <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lemburg,</hi> full of falſhood and calumnies, a ſworn Enemy of <hi>Luther</hi> and his Doctrine. For it is manifeſt that the firſt Letter of <hi>Luther</hi> to <hi>Pope Leo,</hi> which is that that is treated of, was wrote in the beginning of the Year 1518. when he had not as yet any other diſpute then with the Queſtors and Preachers of Indulgences, and that thoſe little Books that <hi>

                     <hi>See both his Letter, and his Writings in the 1 Tome of the Works of</hi> Luther.</note> 
                  <hi>Pope</hi> and his whole Court had openly declared themſelves againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> after <hi>Luther</hi> had appealed from the <hi>Pope</hi> to a Council, and after the <hi>Pope</hi> had made his Doctrine to be condemned as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical by the Divines of <hi>Lovain</hi> and <hi>Cologn;</hi> which evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from that very Epitome of <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> which makes mention
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97749:83"/>
of that Appeal of <hi>Luther</hi> to a Council, and from the Marginal Notes that <hi>Luther</hi> made upon that, which alſo make mention of thoſe deciſions of <hi>Lovain</hi> and <hi>Cologn.</hi> It is then a falſe report of an Enemy of <hi>Luther,</hi> who not being able to find any thing till then blameable in his Conduct, has on purpoſe confounded thoſe times to render him odious, and to juſtify, after ſome manner, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding that cannot be defended. They know not how to deny, that the violence which they uſed againſt him, was not openly condemned, not only by the common people, but by the more wiſe and knowing Perſons themſelves. <hi>He complained,</hi> ſays <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claeus,</hi> that is to ſay, one of his moſt fiery Enemies, <hi>that he was unjuſtly oppreſſed by his adverſaries, whom he openly produced, and gained to himſelf in a little time the favours not only of the ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who eaſily believed him, and who liſtned after all ſorts of Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but that alſo of divers grave and learned men, who giving cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to his words, through an ingenuous ſimplicity, thought that that Monk had no other end, than defending the Truth againſt the Queſtors of Indulgences, who as</hi> Luther <hi>accuſed them, appeared to have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter zeal for the drawing of Money to themſelves, then for procuring, the good of Souls.</hi> He adds, <hi>That the Learned men, Poets and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, defended him, and charged the Pretats and the Divines with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, Pride, Envy, Barbarouſneſs, and Ignorance; ſaying that they only perſecured</hi> Luther <hi>for his Learning, becauſe he appeared to be more Learned than themſelves, and more free in ſpeaking the Truth againſt the cheats and impoſtures of Hypocrites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some time after that <hi>Luther</hi> had appealed from the <hi>Pope</hi> to a Council, the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> dyed, which obliged <hi>Leo</hi> to ſend <hi>Charles Miltit</hi> into <hi>Germany</hi> in the Quality of his <hi>Nuntio.</hi> He preſented a golden Roſe to the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> had ſent him as a Token of his particular Friendſhip, but that Preſent was accompanied with Letters which were ſent both to the Prince and his Council, in which the Pope all along requeſted them, that they would give up <hi>Luther</hi> into his hands as an Heretick, and a Child of the Devil. <hi>Luther</hi> has wrote in ſome part of his works, that <hi>Miliet</hi> was loaden with ſixty ſix Apoſtolick Breves, to cauſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Preface to Tome.</hi> 1.</note> them to be ſtuck up from place to place, and by that means to conduct him more ſecurely to <hi>Rome,</hi> in caſe that Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> ſhould give him up into his hands. But all thoſe Breves, and all thoſe Letters were to no purpoſe; for that Prince would not leave <hi>Luther</hi> to ſo unjuſt a Paſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:97749:84"/>
This oblig'd <hi>Miltit</hi> to betake himſelf to other meaſures: He thought that to make up that buſineſs, he ought to take a courſe contrary to that of Violence and Authority. He would then have ſome private conferences with <hi>Luther</hi> to reconcile him to the <hi>Pope,</hi> he highly blamed the lewd converſations of the Sellers of Indulgences, and perſwaded <hi>Luther</hi> to write yet once more to the <hi>Pope</hi> with reſpect and ſubmiſſion, and yet notwithſtanding it was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ses</hi> Sleidan <hi>and</hi> Reynaldus.</note> agreed that he ſhould impoſe ſilence on both Parties, and that the whole buſineſs ſhould be committed unto ſome Biſhop of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> as to him of <hi>Treves,</hi> or to him of <hi>Saltzburg. Luther</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on his part in good earneſt all that was agreed on; he <note place="margin">Luther. <hi>Tom.</hi> 1.</note> wrote to <hi>Leo</hi> with all the reſpect imaginable, and let him ſee that the Queſtors, and thoſe who had till that time upheld them, had diſhonoured his See and his Church; that as to himſelf, he found himſelf very unhappy to ſee that their Calumnies ſhould have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over his Innocence, and he further offered to give over that matter of Indulgences, and wholly to be ſilent in it, provided that his Adverſaries ſhould do the like. But whether it was that all that Negotiation of <hi>Miltit</hi> was but feigned on his part, or that in effect his counſel was not approved by thoſe of his Party, as <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf inſinautes, it is certain that from the time that that Letter had been drawn from him, <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> a Prince that ſtuck very cloſe to the Intereſts of the <hi>Pope,</hi> deſired that he would make a publick Diſputation at <hi>Leipſic</hi> upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in controverſy; the diſpute was managed, the beginning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Eccius</hi> and <hi>Caroloſtad</hi> concerning Free-will and Grace, but they drew in <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf upon the ſubject of Indulgences, of Purgatory, and the Power of the <hi>Pope.</hi> And they procured almoſt at the ſame time from the Univerſities of <hi>Cologn</hi> and <hi>Lovain,</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of divers Articles drawn out of his Books. He defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf againſt theſe new Adverſaries, and made the World <note place="margin">Luther. <hi>Tom.</hi> 2.</note> ſee by his publick writings the truth of his Doctrine, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of thoſe Condemnations.</p>
               <p>But within a little after, <hi>Pope Leo</hi> being unwilling to try any thing further, publiſhed his terrible Bull of Excommunication <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Extat apud</hi> Luther <hi>tom.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>apud</hi> Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald <hi>ad an.</hi> 1520.</note> againſt him, which they call the Bull <hi>Exurge;</hi> There, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving earneſtly importuned Jeſus Chriſt, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> with all the Saints in Paradiſe, to come to the ſuccour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſets down in particular one and forty Articles of <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine, which he declared to be <hi>reſpectively peſtilent, deſtructive, ſcandalous, falſe, heretical, offending pious Ears,</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:97749:84"/>
                  <hi>ſeducing Souls, and contrary to the Catholick Truth, and to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to the reſpect and obedience that was owing to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>which is the Mother of all the Faithful, and the Miſtriſs of the Faith; and as ſuch ſeverally, he condemned them, diſproved them, rejected them, and declared that they ought to be rejected by Chriſtians of both Sexes. He forbad all Biſhops, Patriarchs, Metropolitans, and generally all Church-men, and Kings, the Emperour, the Electors, Princes, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Barons, Captains,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and in a word, all ſorts of men, to hold thoſe Articles, or to favour them in any manner what ſoever, under the penalty of Excommunication, and being deprived of their Lands and of their Goods, and treated as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Hereticks, favourers of Hereticks, and guilty of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> And as to <hi>Luther,</hi> he complained of him, that he would not come to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he would have let him have ſeen that he had not done ſo much evil as he believed, and he agravated it as a great raſhneſs in him to have appealed to a Council, againſt the Conſtitutions of <hi>Pius</hi> the Second, and of <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, who would have thoſe puniſhed as Hereticks that made ſuch appeals. <hi>That therefore he condemned as Hereticks, him, and all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, if in the ſpace of fifty days they did not renounce all their Errours; he forbad all Chriſtians to have any Commerce or Converſation with them, or to yeild them any neceſſary things, and gave his Orders to the Emperour, to Kings and Princes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to ſeize their Perſons, and to ſend them to</hi> Rome, <hi>promiſing great rewards to thoſe who ſhould do ſo good a work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther,</hi> ſome time after, wrote againſt that Bull, and appealed afreſh to a Council lawfully called; notwithſtanding he juſtified himſelf with great ſolidity about all thoſe condemned Articles. And it is pertinent to note, that among thoſe Articles that the <hi>Pope</hi> Anathematized as Heretical, or Raſh, or Scandalous, and contrary to the Catholick Truth, theſe following Propoſitions might be found: That, that Proverb was moſt true, that ſaid, <hi>That the beſt Pennance is a good Life, that it would be very well if the Church in a Council ſhould ordain that the Laity ſhould receive the Communion in both kinds. That the Treaſure of the Church, from whence the</hi> Pope <hi>drew his Indulgences, is not the Merits of Jeſus Christ and the Saints. That the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>the Succeſſour of Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>is not the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt over all the Churches of the world, nor that there was any one eſtabliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Saint</hi> Peter. <hi>That it is not in the power of the Church or of the</hi> Pope, <hi>to make Articles of Faith, nor to eſtabliſh new Laws for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:97749:85"/>
                  <hi>or for good Works. That tho' the Pope ſhould hold with a great part of the Church, an opinion, which ſhould not it ſelf be erronious, yet it would not be a ſin or an hereſy to hold a contrary opinion, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in things not neceſſary to Salvation, until a General Council ſhould have diſproved the one and approved of the other; that the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prelats and Secular Princes, did not do ill when they aboliſhed the Order of begging Friers. That Purgatory could not be proved by the Holy Canonical Scripture.</hi> Theſe Propoſitions are declared to be either peſtilent, or pernicious, or ſcandalous, or heretical, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecifying any one in particular, for the <hi>Pope</hi> ſpeaks of them only in the whole, that they are ſuch. So it was that <hi>Leo</hi> and all his Court managed thoſe matters. To affirm that a true amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life, a holy and ſincere return from Vice to Vertue, is the beſt of all Pennances, appeared to be a deteſtable crime to them. To wiſh that a General Council might eſtabliſh the Communion of the Euchariſt, according to the Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt and the Cuſtom of the Primitive Church, was ſuch an abomination with them, as was thought ſufficient to deſerve the Flames. Not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive that the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt and of the Saints, made up a certain Treaſure, which neither Faith nor Holineſs, nor Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance could give the Faithful any part of, but which were to be diſpenced only by the way of Indulgences for money, paſs'd in their Judgments for a Helliſh Hereſie. To hold that our Faith has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Word of God for its object, and not that of men alſo, and that God alone can impoſe moral Laws on the Conſcience, was in their opinion, an aſtoniſhing wickedneſs. To believe that one may without Herefy hold an opinion contrary to that of the <hi>Pope,</hi> in matters not neceſſary to Salvation, and not determined by any Council, was a peſtilent errour. To give the leaſt blow to the intereſts of Monks, or the Fire of Purgatory, was an horrible ſacriledge, for which there was not any remiſſion.</p>
               <p>After that condemnation, the <hi>Pope</hi> wrote to <hi>John Frederick</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> earneſtly entreating him not to give any more protection to <hi>Luther,</hi> and he ſent <hi>Hierome Aleander</hi> his <hi>Nuntio</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Germany,</hi> to cauſe that condemnation to be executed. But <hi>Alean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> not being able to obtain of <hi>Frederick</hi> what the <hi>Pope</hi> deſired, obliged the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> who had been Elected in the Room of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and the Princes aſſembled at <hi>Wormes,</hi> to cite <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to appear before them. The Emperour gave him, to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, his Letters of ſafe Conduct; and <hi>Luther</hi> having compared and conſtantly maintained his Doctrine, without any ways regarding
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97749:85"/>
either the threats or the ſollicitations of the Partiſans of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were upon the point to impriſon him, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſafe conduct of the Emperour, and to treat him as they had heretofore done <hi>John Huſs</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> But the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> vehemently oppoſing himſelf to that breach of the publick Faith, they were contented with proſcribing him by a publick Edict. In that Edict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they treat him as a Lunatick, as one poſſeſt by the Devil, and as a Devil incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; <note place="margin">

               <p>After all that, who can ſay that our Fathers could yet with any ſhadow of Reaſon hope for a Reformation on the part of the <hi>Popes</hi> and the <hi>Prelats?</hi> We may ſee in their Conduct, not only a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to a Reformation, but a ſetled deſign, and an unſhaken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to defend their Errours, Superſtitions, and Abuſes, of what nature ſoever they were, and to hazard all, rather then once to conſent that the Church ſhould be purged. We may ſee that they made uſe of all that the moſt exact and refined policy could make them contrive of all the Authority that the ſplendour of their Dignities, and the places which they held could give them amongſt men, and of all that force and violence, that the Favour of Princes and the credulity of the people could afford them. They went ſo far as loudly to declare themſelves Lords of mens Faith: They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, they wrote, they diſputed, they accuſed, they condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they terrified, they excommunicated, they had recourſe to the ſecular power; and could our Fathers, without being blind, look any further for a Reformation from ſuch perſons as thoſe?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That our Fathers, not being able any more to hope for a Reformation, on the part of the</hi> Pope, <hi>or his Prelats, were indiſpenſably bound to provide for their own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to Reform themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>VVE come now to inquire what our Fathers were bound to do, in ſo great a Confuſion. They were perſwaded, not only, that it was poſſible for the Latin Church to have within it a great many Corruptions and Abuſes, but that it really had a very great Company of them; that falſe worſhip, Errors and Superſtitions had broke in as an Inundation, upon the Chriſtian Religion, and that thoſe abuſes growing more groſs, and growing every day more ſtrong, put Chriſtianity into a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt danger of Ruin: Moreover, there was not any hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, either on the part of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or on the part of the Prelats; For the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> with all its Aſſociates, had loudly declared againſt a Reformation, maintaining that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could not Err, that ſhe was the Miſtreſs of Mens Faith, and not to believe as ſhe believed was a Hereſie, worthy of the Flames; and as to the Prelats, they had all ſervile obedience to the wills of the <hi>Popes,</hi> beſides that Ignorance, that Negligence, that Love of the things of the World, and thoſe other Vices in which they were plunged.</p>
               <p>How be it, the buſineſs was not about matters of ſmall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, nor about the Queſtions of the School, moſt commonly unknown to the People, nor about ſome ſpeculative notions, which could not be of any Conſequence to the Actions of true Holineſs. The Controverſy was about divers things eſſential to Religion, which not only fell within the knowledge of the People, but which likewiſe conſiſted in matters of practice, and which by Conſequence being wicked, as our Fathers could make no doubt that they were, could not but be very contrary to the right Worſhip of God, and mens Salvation. For the debate was about a Religious Worſhip which they were to give not to God alone, but to Creatures alſo, to Angels, to Saints, to Images, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97749:86"/>
about certain and infallible Springs from whence they ought to draw their Salvation, in building their confidence upon them; for beſides the mercy of God through the Merit and Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, they joyned to that, the merit of our good-works, our own Satisfactions, the over and above Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of the Saints, and the Authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in diſpencing of Indulgences, They Treated of other works which they held that we ought to do through the Obligation of our Conſciences, and with aſſurance that they were good, and thoſe they made a part of our Sanctification, for they added to thoſe that God had commanded us, thoſe that the <hi>Popes</hi> and their Prelats commanded out of their meer Authority. They Treated of ill actions, from which we ought to abſtain out of the motions of our Conſciences, and which one could not commit without ſin, for beſides thoſe that God had forbidden us, they likewiſe placed in this Rank, thoſe which it ſhould pleaſe the Church to forbid us. They Treated about a certain and infallible Rule of Faith upon which the Minds and Conſciences of Chriſtians might ſtay and reſt, for they would have that principle conſiſt in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, in the Traditions and Deciſions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or its Prelats. The Controverſy was about Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; for they ſaid that the Sacrament of the Euchariſt was the very Perſon of the Son of God, and they adored it under that Quality. the Queſtion was about divers Cuſtoms, introduced into the publick Miniſtry, or generally eſtabliſht by the Cuſtoms of the People that our Fathers thought very contrary to the Spirit of the Goſpel, and true Piety. In fine, in all thoſe and other ſuch like things they Treated about the peace and juſt rights of the Conſcience, the glory of God, the hope of Salvation, and the Preſervation of the Church of Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth. Let them tell us then preciſely what our Fathers ought to have done. Was there any thing in the World of greater concernment then thoſe things which I have ſet down? Or to ſpeak better, was there nothing that could any ways ſtagger them, or hold the minds of all honeſt men in ſuſpence, for ſo much as one moment? Were they bound to renounce their Conſcience, their God and their Salvation, under a pretence that the Flatterers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſpeak of her, what the Holy Scripture ſays of the Godhead, <hi>That if ſhe pulls down, there is no perſon that can build up, if ſhe ſhuts, there is none can open, if ſhe retains the Waters</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Decret. 1.</note>

Do they believe that, they ought to have precipitated themſelves into a inevitable Damnation, and to have precipitated others by their Example, to conſent to the Ruin of the Chriſtian Religion, and utter extinction of the Church, and that leſt they ſhould have been wanting in that reſpect, and blind Obedience that the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and its Prelats require of all the World? This would be in Truth to ſet that obedience at two high a price, and it would coſt us very dear: but they will find but few perſons of good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, who will not confeſs that that would be to puſh on things a little too far.</p>
               <p>They will ſay, it may be, that we ought not alſo to ſuppoſe a thing ſo much in Queſtion; that that prodigious corruption of the Latin Church whereof we ſpeak, and thoſe pretended Intereſts of the Chriſtian Religion, and Mens Salvation, which according to us obliged our Fathers to Reform themſelves, without having any regard of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> or its Prelats, were nothing elſe but <hi>Chimaera's</hi> that we our ſelves have formed at our pleaſure, or ſpecious pretences that our Fathers took, for occaſions to ſeparate themſelves, and that we take after them to defend them with.</p>
               <p>To anſwer to this Objection, I will not ſay, that there is no appearance that our Fathers made uſe of thoſe motives, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to cover their other Intereſts with. They can ſcarce know how to imagin any intereſts interwoven in a buſineſs that evidently drew after it a Thouſand perſecutions, and a Thouſand afflictions, and wherein they were neceſſarily to go through the moſt violent ſtorms, as the ſequel will juſtify. In effect, let them ſay as much as much as they will that <hi>Luther</hi> was hurried away by his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it belongs to thoſe who Treated him with ſo much injuſtice, to diſpute that matter with him before the Tribunal of God, who will one day render to every man according to his works. But as to our Fathers, who had no part in thoſe perſonal Quarrels, they can no ways be ſuſpected to have had an intereſt of Paſſion, or Animoſity. I will not likewiſe ſay, that if our Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had had other intereſts then thoſe which they have ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, which is contrary to all appearance, that yet it cannot be ſaid in reſpect of us, that we do not follow them in the True Faith, ſince we have had leaſure enough to acknowledge what our Reformation has drawn along with it, and what it has coſt us. But I will only ſay, that I make that ſuppoſition only to let our Adverſaries ſee, that without amuſing us any more with thoſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97749:87"/>
formalities, and thoſe perplexing ways which they make uſe of continually which are proper for nothing, but to defend Errors, and to deſtroy the Church by the Tyranny of thoſe who govern, they ought to come to the bottom, and to Determine with us thoſe Fundamental Articles upon which we ground the right that our Fathers had to Reform themſelves. I do not then prejudge any thing by my ſuppoſition, I explain only the ſentiment of the Proteſtants, and the perſwaſion that they entertain. If what they ſay, is not true, it is certain that they have had Reaſon to Reform themſelves for without any more Reaſoning, a man ought always to prefer God, and his own Salvation before a hundred <hi>Popes,</hi> and before ten Thouſand Biſhops. We ought then to come to an Examination of thoſe Matters.</p>
               <p>This is what the Author of thoſe Prejudices, as hot as he is in his Controverſy, has been forced to acknowledge. For to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Chap.</hi> 7.</note> diſintangle himſelf from an Argument, to which he ſays the whole Book of the Apology of Mr. <hi>Daille</hi> is reducible, [and which he repreſents in theſe words.] <hi>We ought not to remain united to ſuch a Communion as binds us to profeſs Fundamental Errors againſt the Faith, and to practiſe an Idolatrous and Sacrilegious Worſhip. But the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>binds us to profeſs divers fundamental Errors, and to practiſe Idolatrous and Sacrilegious Worſhip diverſe ways, as in the Adoration of the Hoſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore we ought not to remain in her Communion,</hi> &amp;c.] He diſtinguiſhes between two ſorts of Separation, one of which he calls <hi>ſimple and Negative, which,</hi> ſays he, <hi>conſiſts more in the Negation of certain Acts of Communion, then in Poſitive Acts against that Communion from which we ſeparate.</hi> The other he calls a <hi>Poſitive Separation, which includes the Erecting of a ſeparate Society, the Eſtabliſhing of a new Miniſtry, and the poſitive Condemnation of the former Communion, to which it had been <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited.</hi> Upon that Diſtinction, he ſays, <hi>That it is to no purpoſe that the</hi> Calviniſts <hi>ſay, That their Conſciences will not any more allow them to be united with the Catholicks ſheltring themſelves under that Ambiguous Term of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, That their Conſciences cannot any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinder them from taking part in ſome Actions, which their falſe Principles make them look upon as criminal; but they would no ways engage them to all thoſe exceſſes to which they are carri'd out. That in fine, if it were true, that without betraying your Conſciences, they could not give that honour which we pay to the Saints and their Relicks, they ought to content themſelves not to give it. But that it will in no wiſe follow from thence, that they ought to go about to ſet up a body</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:97749:88"/>
                  <hi>apart. That it is this latter ſort of Separation whereof they accuſe us, and that it is that kind of it that we ought to juſtify our ſelves from.</hi> And a little lower, <hi>If</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Calviniſts ſhould make what ſuppoſitions they pleaſed upon the State of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>if they ſhould as much as they had a mind to do, accuſe it of Error, and Idolatry; it would be enough to Anſwer them in one word, That if thoſe pretended Errors ſhould give them any right to refuſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs them, and to practiſe thoſe actions which ſhould include them, yet they no ways gave them any night to ſet up themſelves againſt the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>to anathematize her, to ſet up a body a part, and to take to themſelves the Quality of Paſtors, although they had neither Authority nor Miſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not now meddle with that poſitive Separation, which the Author of the Prejudices makes ſo great a Crime in us. We ſhall ſhew in the end, that our Fathers did nothing in that reſpect, but what they were bound to do in their Conſciences, and with the neglect of which they could not diſpence without Sin. But this we ſhall come to conſider in its proper place, it may be enough for us at preſent, to know, that with the conſent of the Author of Prejudices we may ſuppoſe it as a thing indiſputable, <hi>That our Fathers, obeying the Dictates of their Conſciences, had right to reſuſe to profeſs thoſe Errors, in which they believed the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be entangled, and no more to take any part in certain actions that involved thoſe Errors.</hi> I profeſs it were deſirable that the Author of Prejudices had told us a little more clearly his own thoughts of that Negative Separation; But howſoever he has carried himſelf in his Expreſſions, I may ſay, if I am not miſtaken without fear of any oppoſition, that that which he has here granted us is not one of thoſe Conceſſions, which are ſometimes given to adverſaries, only to cut off the Diſpute; but that indeed he has ſpoken according to his real thoughts. For when in a Controverſy of this nature a man diſtinguiſhes about this general Theſis; <hi>That one ought to ſeparate from a Church which binds one to profeſs Error,</hi> in noting, that it may be ſaid in two ſences, the one <hi>That one ought to ſeparate ones ſelf</hi> Negatively, <hi>in not medling with that which would wound the Conſcience:</hi> and the other, <hi>That one ought to ſeparate poſitively,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>that one ought to ſet up a Society ſeparate from that, and to eſtabliſh a new Miniſtry.</hi> That he quitted the former ſence, in ſaying only, <hi>that it was very ill applied to the Catholick Church,</hi> reſtrained himſelf only to the latter, that he would ſay, <hi>that it was this latter kind of</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:97749:88"/>
                  <hi>Separation whereof he accuſed us, and about which we ought to juſtify our ſelves, that our Conſciences could not any further hinder us, then from taking part in thoſe actions which our Principles ſhould make us look on as Criminal; that if we could not without betraying our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, render that Honour to Saints and Relicks which they give them, we ought to content our ſelves with not doing it.</hi> When a man, I ſay, ſpeaks as the Author of Prejudices after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the heat of a diſpute, which he believes to be as weighty as that; there is a great likelyhood, that it is not a meer conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to his adverſaries, but a true and lively expreſſion of that which he finds in himſelf to be very Juſt and Reaſonable. Howſoever it be, without informing our ſelves further about a thing wherein we are little concern'd, we will ſuppoſe it, ſince he will have it ſo, as a propoſition not to be diſputed, That our Fathers could lawfully ſeperate from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by a <hi>Negative</hi> Separation, that is to ſay, <hi>in not to taking any part in that which would wound their Conſciences.</hi> But that ſignifies, in our ſtile, that they had right to reform themſelves, ſince we call nothing elſe preciſely Reformation, but that publick Rejection, which they made of divers things, which they judged to be ill, and contrary to Chriſtianity. Whether they did ill to go further and to proceed to a <hi>Poſitive</hi> Separation, that is a Queſtion apart, which does not in the leaſt hinder, that their Reformation taken only as a <hi>Negative</hi> Separation, might not have been done with Juſtice and according to that right, that Conſcience gives to every man.</p>
               <p>But now, methinks, this point being ſo well clear'd, clears a multitude of others, and we may, by that conceſſion of the Author of Prejudices, very well decide ſome <hi>Questions.</hi> In the firſt place, They ought no further to ſet before us that abſolute obedience to the Orders and deciſions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the matters of Faith and Worſhip, to which they would hitherto have all the Faithful indiſpenſably obliged. For if thoſe, whoſe Conſciences ſhall tell them, that, That Church binds them to believe Errors and to practiſe a falſe worſhip, may refuſe to profeſs to believe thoſe Errors, and to performe that Worſhip, who ſees not that that abſolute obedience is overthrown? Since it will depend on the dictates of the Conſcience of every one, and that the Conſcience of each one will give it its bounds, and ſuſpend it, in reſpect of ſome certain things and actions. 2. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can no more treat thoſe as Diſobedient and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97749:89"/>
who through the dictates of their Conſciences refuſe to profeſs to believe that which ſhe decides and to practiſe that which ſhe ordains, nor perſecute them as ſuch, and whatſoever ſhe ſhould make them ſuffer upon that pretence of Rebellion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, would be but an unjuſt perſecution, of which ſhe will be bound to give an account to God and men. 3. They cannot alſo any farther demand of us what Call our Fathers had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves, that is to ſay, to reject their Superſtitions, and the Errors which were to be found in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in their days; for they needed nothing elſe but the motions of their Conſciences to give them a Right to refuſe to profeſs them. 4. They ought alſo to acknowledge that the Authority of the Church, how great ſoever it may be, is it yet far leſs then that of the Conſcience, ſince it is not only limited, but ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that whenſoeveer they ſhould be in oppoſitian, a man would have right to leave the Authority of the Church, and to follow his Conſcience. 5. And ſince even an erronious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienes, ſuch as the Author of the Prejudices ſuppoſes ours, and that of our Fathers to be, could ſuſpend Acts, commanded by the Church, it follows neceſſarily from thence, that to reconcile the Church and the Conſcience when they ſhould be ſet in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt come to the Foundation, and diſcuſs the things themſelves, for there is no other way to free the Conſcience from <note place="margin">Deſ-abuſer.</note> Errors. And how much more are we obliged to do it, when the Church abuſes her Authority, in teaching thoſe things which are really falſe, or in commanding thoſe actions which are indeed unjuſt and criminal. All then depends on the diſcuſſion of thoſe matters by themſelves.</p>
               <p>But, they will ſay, your Fathers ought to have been contented to have made uſe of their rights, each one in particular, they could have kept themſelves from making any profeſſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving thoſe pretended Errors, and not have taken any part in thoſe actions which they diſapproved, and yet nevertheleſs have kept ſilence. Wherefore did they diſturb the publick peace by their Tumults? Why did they divulge by their out-cries the Judgment which they made of the Tenets and Cuſtoms of their Church? Did they not in that, ſin againſt that reſpect which they owed to their Prelats, and that Charity which they owed to their Brethren?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:97749:89"/>
To anſwer to this Objection, I ſay, That the keeping ſilence is not always equally juſt, it has its bounds and its meaſures according to the weight of the things that are treated of, and to the Circumſtances of Times and Perſons. If the buſineſs had been only about ſome meer Queſtions of the School, upon points of Speculation, or about ſome unprofitable Ceremonies, or ſome bad order in the Government, or even about ſome popular Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, which ſhould not have proceeded ſo far as to corrupt the ſaving Efficacy of the Goſpel, I confeſs our Fathers had been more obliged to have kept ſilence, then to have encountred their Prelats, and raiſed thoſe troubles through the diverſity of their Opinions. The Love of Peace, reſpect for Order Chriſtian Charity, bidds us to bear things of that nature well, which we do not ſo well approve of our ſelves, and even there to follow the Faſhion as far as we can, without wounding our Conſciences, and if we happen to ſpeak or write of them, it ought to be done in a gentle and prudent manner, with a regard had to the Times, and the diſpoſitions of Men, always remembring that the Church of God will never be in a State of compleat perfection upon Earth, and that God himſelf bears with the defects of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren through his mercy. But we ought alſo to take heed how we ſtretch the keeping of that ſilence too far; for there are certain Seaſons, wherein one cannot hold one's peace, without betraying of God, without weakly abandoning the true intereſts of the Church, and without falling into that deteſtable Sin, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls, <hi>holding the Truth in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Such was the Time of the Triumph of <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> in the fourth <hi>Centuey,</hi> for there the matter being a capital Hereſy, which had then took hold of the publick Miniſtry, there was not any more place for ſilence, there was a neceſſity on the contrary of crying out, and of crying very loud, without any regard had either to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſance which they owed to their Brethren, or to the Love of peace, or the Dignity of the Prelats, or the Authority of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills, or to all thoſe falſe reaſons of ſilence which humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ordinarily ſuggeſts. Therefore it was, that a ſimple <hi>Monk</hi> of thoſe Times, called <hi>Aphraates,</hi> although he neither had any other Call, or Office, then that of the concern that every one has for the Conſervation of the Truth, yet could not contain himſelf within his Cell, nor be hindered from oppoſing himſelf with all his might to that Hereſy; and the Emperor <hi>Valens,</hi>

who favoured the <hi>Arrians,</hi> having check't him for that boldneſs, in telling him, that he ought to have kept himſelf in his Cell, and to have applied himſelf only to pray to God, according to the Conditions of that Religious Life into which he had entred, <hi>Aphraates</hi> anſwered him, <hi>If I were a maid, and ſhould keep my Chamber with my Father, and if I ſhould ſee Fire take hold of the Houſe, ſhould I not be bound to go out of my Chamber, and run on every ſide to bring water to put out the Fire.</hi> Meaning by that, That when the ſafety of Chriſtianity was in danger of being deſtroyed, it was a Crime to hold ones peace and ſit ſtill in quiet.</p>
               <p>But this is exactly the Caſe wherein our Fathers found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For they beheld the Chriſtian Religion, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, The Latin Church ready to be Ship-wrackt, as a Veſſel that takes in water on every ſide. They ſaw in that miſerable Church, Divinity falſified and corrupted by a thouſand vain and ridiculous Queſtions. The Schools infected with the Art of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry and Cheats, the Pulpits proſtituted to Tales, Jeſts and Legends, Benefices filled with perſons unworthy and uncapable. Church Dignities ſold to thoſe who bid higheſt, good Learning baniſht, and perſecuted, Religion loaded with a rabble of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Ceremonies, the People abuſed by a thouſand Follies, Church-Government changed into an intolerable Oppreſſion. The Worſhip of God transferred to Creatures, and even to thoſe Creatures that were dead and inſenſible, the ſaving Truths of the Goſpel neglected, Errors and Fancies of Mens minds Preached up in ſtead of them. The Study of the Holy Scripture abandoned, the Actions of true Piety, altered by falſe Ideas, the Commands of God broken, his Soveraign Authority uſurped, his mercy ſet in partnerſhip with Satisfactions of men, his Laws aſſociated with the Laws of men, and his Grace with our Free-will, the only Sacrifice of his Son multiplied, the Vertue of his Interceſſion communicated to Saints and Angels. The Subſtance of Bread adored as his Divine Body, his Soveraign Prophetick and Kingly Offices Tranſported to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and his Prieſtly to the Prieſts, his Sacraments altered, his cleareſt words eluded by their Gloſſes, and raſh Diſtinctions, and his Miniſtry changed into a Deſpotick Empire over mens Conſciences. In a word, they ſaw nothing that remained intire in that Religion. Whether their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in that regard, were juſt or unjuſt, Reaſonable, or ill
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97749:90"/>
grounded, it is what a diſcuſſion will juſtify, when they will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly come to conſider it. But nevertheleſs our Fathers were perſwaded of all that which I have mentioned, and under that perſwaſion who can doubt that they ought not to have loudly declared themſelves, and that a deep ſilence would not have rendred them Criminal before God and men? And they were the more Obliged to ſpeak, in that as we have ſhewn in the foregoing Chapter, they had nothing more to look for from their Prelats, and in that the injuſt and violent Proceedings of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> made them ſufficiently know that the Evil was not to be Remedied on that ſide, and that the Time for each man to Reform himſelf, was already come.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That our Fathers had a Lawful and Sufficient Call to Reform themſelves, and to Labour to Reform others.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALthough this Queſtion about the Call of our Fathers for a Reformation, is already ſufficiently decided, by what I have before Repreſented, ſince they cannot require a more lawful Call, then that which is founded upon the indiſpenſable Obligation of our Salvation, I ſhall not fail notwithſtanding, to Treat of this matter yet a little further, to omit nothing that may ſerve for our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that the chief thing that ought to be done to make a right Judgment of a Call, in the buſineſs of Religion, is to ſearch into what nature thoſe Actions are of, about which it is engaged, whether they be juſt or unjuſt, good or ill in themſelves; for there cannot be the leaſt lawful Call for that which is ill, but there is always one naturally for what is good, which I ſhall name a Call of things, to diſtinguiſh it from that Call of perſons whereof I ſhall ſpeak in the ſequel. But now upon this Principle, which to me ſeems indiſputable, we have little elſe to do, then to demand of our Adverſaries whether they do not believe, that as it is naturally juſt to embrace and to defend the Truth, ſo alſo that 'tis as juſt to reject and oppoſe Errors, and to baniſh them not only out of that Society wherein a man is, but even out of the world it ſelf as much as it lies in his power to do: We need, I ſay, but only to demand of them, whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, That a Falſhood has not in its own nature any right to be believed, or to be taught, and that it is for that Reaſon, that ſhe makes uſe of the Colours of Truth, to make her ſelf to be received under another Name then her own, becauſe that when ſhe appears in her natural dreſs, it excites, or at leaſt it ought to excite the hatred and averſion of men. I know very well that all Falſhoods do not equally deſerve that Averſion, and that there are ſome that may appear indifferent enough in compariſon of others, but I ſay that there are alſo ſome, of which one can't tell how to paſs ſo favourable a Judgment. Errors in Religion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97749:91"/>
have a far different Character from thoſe in Philoſophy, and in Religion it ſelf thoſe which always when they arrive vitiate the mind and heart, are far more odious then thoſe which do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave the mind; and thoſe which hinder all the ſaving Eſſicacy of the Goſpel are infinitely more ſo; how much more when they are gathered together to an exceeding great number, and mutually uphold and ſuſtain one another, not unlike thoſe black Clouds which in the moſt Stormy days of Winter joyn themſelves one to another to make up but one general one, and to deprive us of the light of the Sun. Hitherto, poſſibly they will not conteſt any thing. But if it be reaſonable enough that there ſhould be no quarrel made about thoſe general Propoſitions, they ought not further to make any in this particular Queſtion, if the Actions of our Fathers were in their own nature good and juſt, ſince we ſuppoſe, not only, that thoſe things which they rejected and cauſed others to reject, were Errors, but alſo that they were Capital Errors of that laſt ſort which I ſpoke of juſt before, which one cannot look on without dread and amazement. For it is upon that ſuppoſition that we defend our Fathers, and if they diſpute it with us they ought to quit this diſpute about Forms, and to enter upon a Diſcuſſion of the very Foundation it ſelf.</p>
               <p>They may alleadge, that they had a long continued poſſeſſion, in favour of thoſe things which our Reformers oppoſed; ſince they were found eſtabliſht in the Church many Ages ago; and that, as in a Civil Society, the Laws forbid thoſe to be moleſted, who are in a long and Antient poſſeſſion, and to be bound to produce their firſt Title, though at the ſame time it ſhould be maintained, that they are Uſurpers. So alſo our Fathers ought not to be heard any further, againſt the Sentiments and Cuſtomes which the Times had in ſome ſort conſecrated and made venerable. But this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer will be of no Uſe to them; for not to alleadge here, That the greateſt part of thoſe Opinions and Practiſes were new, enough as has been ſufficiently Juſtified; not to ſay, that they had been publickly diſputed, and by conſequence, That that poſſeſſion whereof they ſpeak was not peaceable: Who knows not, that there can be nothing preſcribed in matters of Faith and Worſhip againſt the True Religion, ſince that Religion is of God in all its parts, and that there is neither any Time, nor Cuſtom, nor poſſeſſion that can make a true thing of a falſe, or a Divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a humane Tradition, or any Vertue of a Vice? In a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:97749:92"/>
Civil Society, Laws Eſtabliſh Preſcriptions with very good Reaſon, becauſe without them, the peace of the Community, which is the only end that thoſe Laws propound to themſelves, cannot be well preſerved. But in a Religious Society, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end is the Glory of God and Salvation of the Faithful, which are two things that are eſtabliſhed on certain Perpetual, and Invariable Foundations, and by conſequence have no reſpect to any long prepoſſeſſions on the contrary ſide how Antient ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may have been. If Religion were capable of any ſuch Preſcriptions; Chriſtianity would be bound to let <hi>Paganiſm</hi> alone, for how long time paſt has <hi>Paganiſm</hi> been ſeated in the Poſſeſſion of the Faith of men? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf acknowledges it in thoſe very places wherein he exhorts ſuch to be Converted. <hi>Turn you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>from theſe Vanities unto the living God who made Heaven</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 14.</note> 
                  <hi>and Earth, who in Times paſt ſuffered all Nations to walk in their own ways,</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>God having winked at the Times of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance commands now all men every where to Repent.</hi> They cannot <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 17.</note> therefore bring any thing of Preſcription againſt us, and it will always remain certain, that, if that which our Fathers have ſaid concerning the Corruption of the Latin Church in their days be true, as we ſuppoſe it to be, the Reformation was an Action good and juſt in it ſelf, and by Conſequence in that reſpect, they can have nothing to ſay againſt their Call to it.</p>
               <p>But as it is not enough to eſtabliſh a Lawful Call, to ſuppoſe that what is done is good in it ſelf, and as it is further neceſſary that the perſon that does it ſhould have right to do it, it remains yet to be further inquired into, whether our Fathers had power to do what they did. For how many Actions are there that are juſt in themſelves which it does not belong to all the World to do, and which then become unjuſt and ill, when every one thruſts himſelf in of his own Authority without being lawfully called? It is not permitted, for Example, to all the World, to puniſh the wicked, although that puniſhment might be juſt, it is not permitted to all men to change publick Cuſtoms, although thoſe changes ſhould be good and advantageous to the Society. We ought then to ſee what Call our Fathers had to Reform themſelves, and others. But this Queſtion would be eaſily decided, if it be conſidered, that in all Societies there are two ſorts of Common Actions, the one fort of thoſe that are ſo Common, as to belong to all the Body taken <hi>Collective</hi> as they ſpeak in the School, and not to each particular perſon. So in a Parliament, to pronounce
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97749:92"/>
a Sentance, to abſolve a man, or to condemn him, they are the Actions of the whole Body, and not of each of thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, ſo, to declare War and to make peace, are the Acts of him or thoſe who hold all the Rights of the State in their hands. But there are other Actions which are ſo Common in a Society, as to belong to each particular perſon, or as they ſay to all <hi>Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive,</hi> and not to all <hi>Collective.</hi> So, to give ones advice in an Aſſembly, is the Act, not of the whole Body, but of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon who compoſes it; and to live in a Kingdom, to contract Alliances, to poſſeſs one's goods, to labour, to defend one's ſelf againſt the incommodities of Life, are Actions ſo Common, as to belong to all particular Perſons. And ſo the Civilians have very well diſtinguiſhed, in ſaying, that there are ſome Acts which reſpect, <hi>Omnes ut ſingulos,</hi> and that there are others, which belong <hi>ad Omnes ut univerſos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To Apply that Diſtinction only to our preſent Subject, I ſay, that in Religious Society which is the Church, Faith, Piety, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and by Conſequence the Rejecting of Errors, of falſe Worſhip, and of Sins, are thoſe common Actions that belong to all private men. <hi>The Juſt Lives by his Faith,</hi> ſays the Scripture, and as it would be ridiculous to demand of any man in a Civil Society, what Perſonal Call he had to live, to labour to avoid that which would be hurtful to his Life, and to have a care of his own preſervation, ſo it is alſo an Abſurdity to demand of our Fathers, what call they had to believe aright in God, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him purely, and to remove far from them, all that which they believed to be contrary to a Spiritual-Life and their own Salvation: For they need not for that, any other Call, then the Obligation that lies upon every one to ſave himſelf, and the neceſſity of beating back all that which would oppoſe it ſelf to ſo juſt an Obligation, There are not in a Civil Society any certain Select Perſons, who only have a right to Live, to Act, and to labour for others, whilſt thoſe others ſhould be dead, or not able to move. So alſo there are none in a Religious Society, who ought to believe and to be good for others, whilſt thoſe others ſhould remain in ignorance or in ſin; and that Implicit Faith, which ſome have invented, by which a man is to believe in general that which the Church believes, to go no further, is in truth the moſt Commodious way of all others for thoſe men who have ſomething elſe to do then to ſerve God; but it is alſo moſt proper for the Damnation of men. Faith then is a thing ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97749:93"/>
as to belong to particular Perſons, ſhe is ſo one in the whole Body of the Church, as to diſtribute her ſelf to each one, and one could not be of that Body of the Church, if one were not a believer, as one could not be of the Body in a Civil Society, if one were not a man and had not Life. So, each man, has not only a perſonal Call, but lies alſo under an Obligation to believe, and to live as a good Chriſtian, whence it follows, that each man has a Call to remove far from him all that he ſhall judge to be contrary to the Truth of his uprightneſs, Faith, and Piety, as alſo that being under an Obligation to live Holily, and Juſtly, he has a Call to avoid Sins, and to repent of them when ſoever he ſhall commit them.</p>
               <p>But is not this, ſome will ſay, to rend the Church by Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to make ones ſelf guilty of a Schiſm, ſo to reject, out of ſelf-will, the common Sentiments and Cuſtomes, without the conſent of the whole Society? No certainly, for the true Union of the Church does not conſiſt in holding of Errors, how common ſoever they may be, nor in any falſe-worſhip, after what manner ſoever it be Eſtabliſhed. Theſe things do not only, not belong to a Chriſtian Communion, but they deſtroy it, as diſeaſes, how popular and general ſoever they may be, do bring nothing but deſolation on a Civil Society, inſtead of being the Bonds to Unite it. So the Union of the Church doth not bind any perſon in that reſpect; on the contrary, it engages us to ſhew our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren a good Example in beginning to Reform by our ſelves. For the greater Love any one has for the Church, the more he ought to free it from thoſe evils that preſs in upon it, and eſpecially then when thoſe evils ſhall put it into a manifeſt danger of Ruin. If it is ſo, our Adverſaries will yet further reply, Is not that ſome way to break that Communion, when thoſe things that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, are Publick and common? I confeſs, that it is to break a Society, but a bad Society, which being againſt the right of Chriſtianity, gives no lawful Call to any perſon to enter into it, or to defend it, but on the contrary, ſhe gives a Call to all, and binds them at the ſame time to break and oppoſe it. A Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Church has two bonds of its Communion, the one conſiſting in what is good, the other in what is ill, the one of which makes it to be a Church, the other a Corrupted Church, the one bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only men among themſelves, but with God alſo, and the other, that in Uniting men among themſelves, tends to divide and ſeparate them from God. The former of thoſe bonds ought
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97749:93"/>
to be regarded, and preſerved intire, as much as lies in our power, but the Second is a mortal bond, which no perſon has a right to make, and which all men have a Call and Obligation to diſſolve. It is as certain, that the firſt of thoſe bonds gives us a right, and Call to Act againſt the other; for Truth and Piety Authoriſe us againſt Error and Superſtition, and it is the Love that we bear to the Church that opens our mouths againſt its Corruptions. There can then be nothing further conteſted about the perſonal Call of our Fathers concerning their own Reformation. But had they any Right to Labour in the Reforming of others? Who can doubt it? Charity would have bound them to procure that good for others, which they had thought it their duty to procure for themſelves. That Chriſtian Communion in which they lived among their Brethren, did not leſs oblige them to it. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Glory of God which appeared to them to cry loudly for a general Reformation urged them on to it, and their own Innocence exacted it of them that they ſhould make it appear to the Eyes of the Publick, in laying open the Foundations of thoſe Errors, which they were conſtrained to forſake, which could not well have been done without exhorting others to imitate them. Being then bound to all theſe Duties, none can deny, that they had not a ſufficient Call to ſtir up their Brethren to Reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with them.</p>
               <p>That which I have ſaid will appear more evident, if we paſs on to the Conſideration of the Circumſtances of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for we have already ſeen after a long and vain Expectation, there could be nothing more hoped for on the ſide of <hi>Rome</hi> or its Prelats. We have ſeen alſo that the evils whereof our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made ſuch Complaints, and which they would have cured, did not lye in things indifferent, that were trivial or tolerable, but in the very Eſſentials of Religion; and theſe two Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances added to what I have juſt before repreſented, let us ſee that our Fathers were not only in the right, and not only under an Obligation, but under a neceſſary and indiſpenſable Obligation to do that which they have done. I confeſs that if the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and its Clergy would have laboured in good earneſt for a Reformation, it had been the Duty of our Fathers to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from their hands; for how rude and corrupt ſoever their Call had been, that Action had rectified it. I confeſs alſo that if the Diſpute had been only about things of ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, our Fathers had done better to have kept themſelves quiet,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97749:94"/>
as I have acknowledged in the foregoing Chapter. But they can alleadge neither the one nor the other; for <hi>Rome</hi> and its Biſhops were obſtinate in the deſign to Reform nothing, and matters were reduced to the very utmoſt extremity, ſo that the Call of our Fathers appears yet more indiſputable, being grounded on theſe three Foundations, of Right, of Obligation, and Neceſſity, and that ſame Neceſſity was ſo much the greater, as the evil was more inveterate, and had ſpread it ſelf almoſt over all the parts of the Body of the Church to which thoſe words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> might be generally applied. <hi>From the Crown of the head to the ſole of the foot there was no ſoundneſs in her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if any would have us yet further Examine the other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, they will find that they all concur to eſtabliſh that Call whereof we Treat: I rank in this place all thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Qualities wherewith it pleaſed God to inrich thoſe among our Fathers who contributed moſt of all to the work of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Who may not perceive in them a lively and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating underſtanding, a ſolid Judgment, an exquiſite and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found knowledge, an indefatigable propenſion to Labour, a wonderful readineſs to compoſe and to deliver, an exceeding exact ſtudy of the Scripture, and the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, a great and reſolute Soul, an unſhaken courage, an upright Conſcience, a ſincere love of the Truth, an ardent zeal for the Glory of God, a ſolid Piety, without Hypocriſie, and without Pride, a plain and open Carriage, an intire diſengage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the things of the World, an admirable confidence in God, and in his Providence, a Cordial Friendſhip to all good men, and the greateſt averſion to the Vices, Prophanation, and Sophiſtry of others? Theſe were the Gifts and Talents where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Divine Favour Honoured the greateſt part of them, there yet remains the livelieſt Characters of them in their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and they were as the Seal wherewith God would confirm their Call. For when his Wiſdom deſigns perſons to any great work, it is wont to beſtow on them thoſe neceſſary qualifications to acquit themſelves in it, and we may ſay without fear of being charged with derogating from the Truth by thoſe who know Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, that from the Sixth Age until that of our Fathers, that is to ſay, for the ſpace of more then nine hundred Years, there could not be found any ſpace of Time ſo fertile in great men, as that of the Reformation was which ſhews that God had a deſign to make uſe of them for that Work, as the event has juſtified.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:97749:94"/>
Add to all that, The Ardent and almoſt Univerſal deſire among the People to ſee a good Reformation ſpring up in the Church; for even that is a yet further Seal to the Call of the Reformers, in as much as it is a Teſtimony that God had markt out that Age wherein to purge his floor, as the Scripture ſpeaks. Who knows not that that deſire was ſuch, as neither the Artifices, nor the Violences, nor the Calumnies wherewith they laboured to darken the Reformation, could wholly put a ſtop to. The Church was left in Ignorance, and in Superſtition, ſhe panted after the Light of the Goſpel, which had been for ſo long a Time hid under a dark vail, and that general Diſpoſition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe was, may let us ſee that the Time of her Deliverance was come.</p>
               <p>But, laſtly, is it not true, that then the greateſt part of thoſe who laboured in that Reformation, were Eccleſiaſtical perſons, whom the Duty of their place obliged more particularly then others, to root out Errors from the minds of men, to purify Religion, and to endeavour that God ſhould be worſhipped ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Will? Every one knows that <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> who appeared the firſt in that Great Work, were not only Prieſts, but ordinary Preachers alſo, the one at <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> and the other at <hi>Zurich,</hi> and that the former was Profeſſour in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And they are not ignorant that thoſe who joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to them to advance that deſign, were alſo in Publick Offices in the Church, as the whole Univerſity of <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> a very great Number of Prieſts, and other Church-men, with Biſhops, and Arch-Biſhops in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>Swedeland,</hi> and in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and ſome even in <hi>France,</hi> and the whole Body of Biſhops in <hi>England.</hi> They will ſay, it may be, that the <hi>Pope</hi> Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated them all, whence it follows that they had no more either any publick Call, or lawful Miniſtry. But that Anſwer would be fallacious; For the <hi>Pope</hi> having Excommunicated them for nothing elſe, but that buſineſs of the Reformation, his Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication can be conſidered no otherwiſe then as null in this Cauſe, without an Obligation to enter upon an Examination of the Validity of his Thunders in general. In effect, if they did their Duty, if they obeyed their Call in Reforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in reforming their Flocks, it ought not to be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, that thoſe Excommunications which they ſuffered for ſo good a Cauſe, did not fall, of right, upon thoſe who unjuſtly pronounced them, and that not only what our Reformers had
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:97749:95"/>
done before, but alſo what they did afterward, was well and lawfully done. Who can deny that an Excommunication con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Glory of God, to the good of the Church, and to the Salvation of men, ſhould not not be Null? But if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was juſt, and the Glory of God, the good of the Church and the Salvation of the People called for it, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they did in this Diſpute, they may very well ſee that the Thunders of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon this Subject are unjuſt, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of no conſideration. They ought not then to propound things ſo to us, nor to deny the firſt Reformers to be publick perſons who had a part in the Miniſtry of the Church, and who for that Reaſon had a moſt ſtrict Obligation to Labour in the Re-eſtabliſhment of its Purity. And to declare what we think; thoſe Excommunications of the <hi>Popes</hi> were ſo far from dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the Right and Call of the firſt Reformers, that they did on the contrary confirm them the more, and that for two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The one, in that they made them ſee more and more, that they could hope for nothing on the part of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Biſhops of its ſide, from whence there aroſe an indiſpenſable neceſſity on our Fathers to employ themſelves in it; and the other, in that thoſe pretended Excommunications furniſht them alſo with a juſt Subject, of laying open more and more to the Eyes of the people, the groſs and fundamental Errors, whoſe Protection the <hi>Popes</hi> took up with ſo great an Ardour. To which I add, That as much as the <hi>Popes</hi> and the Prelats of their party oppoſed themſelves to the Reformation, ſo much they loſt of that Right which yet remained to them in that publick Miniſtry, which they abuſed with ſo great Injuſtice, and that very thing did but ſtrengthen the Right of the other Party, and render their Miniſtry more Publick and more Lawful. For in thoſe conteſts that divide a Body or a Society, that which one of the parties loſes by its ill Conduct, is re-aſſembled together and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united in the other. But as it is only proper to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to Treat of the Call that our Fathers had to Reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and to Labour to Reform others, that is to ſay, meerly to reject Errors, and to excite others to do the ſame; and not to go further to talk of their Right, or Call to the publick Miniſtry; We ought not to inſiſt more upon this matter, which ſhall be Treated of in its place. In effect, there are two ſorts of Calls which we ought not to confound, That of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and that of the perpetual Exerciſe of the Goſpel-Miniſtry.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97749:95"/>
And the Author of the Prejudices himſelf ſeems to have Judiciouſly enough diſtinguiſhed them, when he lays down two ſorts of Separation, the one Negative, which conſiſts only in a rejecting of thoſe things that are ill; and the other Poſitive, which goes ſo far as to ſet up a Body apart with the Exerciſe of the Miniſtry. We ſhall therefore ſpeak elſewhere of the Right that our Fathers had to ſet up a publick Miniſtry, and it ſhall ſuffice for the preſent to have ſolidly Eſtabliſhed their Call to Reform.</p>
               <p>To ſhut up this Chapter, it remains only that we ſpeak a Word to a Queſtion, which they here raiſe about this Call, in the ſame ſence in which we here conſider it! For they demand of us whether it was Ordinary or Extraordinary? To which I Anſwer, That it was both the one and the other, in different reſpects. It was Ordinary as to its Right, ſince all men have an Ordinary and perpetual Right to reject Errors, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and to employ themſelves in making their Brethren to reject them, according to the Common Laws of Piety, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The Paſtors alſo have an Ordinary and perpetual Right to do the ſame Thing, and to make uſe of that Publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which their Function gives them for the guidance of their Flocks. It was Ordinary as to the Obligation which lay as well upon the People as the Paſtors to do that which they did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a Law of Chriſtianity, and not a new Law or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that bound them to it, their Duty was founded upon the principles of that very Goſpel, and of the ſame Chriſtian Religion which Jeſus Chriſt had Founded, and whereof they made a Profeſſion. But I affirm that it was likewiſe Extraordinary in two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, in reſpect of that extream and indiſpenſable Neceſſity which lay upon them, to do what they did. For although we have always a Right to reject thoſe Errors, and that falſe Worſhip which may creep into the Church, and although we ſhould be always bound to make uſe of it alſo, if it were ſo, yet it is not always Neceſſary to come to the practiſe, or the Exerciſe of that Right and of that Obligation, at leaſt to ſo Publick and Splendid a one as that of our Fathers was, becauſe the Church is not always in a State of Confuſion and Diſorder, as ſhe was in their Time. Things Ordinarily glide away in a more regulated courſe; the Publick Miniſtry is more pure, and the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97749:96"/>
Goſpel more diſingaged from the oppreſſion of Traditions, or Humane Superſtitions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Call was Extraordinary in reſpect of thoſe qualities wherewith God inveſted our firſt Reformers, and thoſe who joyned with them in ſo great a work; for it is not an Ordinary thing to ſee ſuch eminent gifts, and that in ſo great a Number, as thoſe which appeared in the Age of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, accompanied with ſuch an Heroical Spirit, as our Fathers had, and ſuch a great Love for the purity of the Goſpel, as the People had, who received their Inſtructions; All which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains us to acknowlede, a particular and ſpecial Providence of God, throughout the whole Conduct of that great Divine Work, who raiſed up Labourers, fitted for the Harveſt which he had prepared.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An Anſwer to the Objections, that are made againſt the Perſons of the Reformers.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE have hitherto, methinks, ſufficiently juſtified the Action of our Fathers in the buſineſs of the Reformation. It appears, that they had but too many Reaſons to ſuſpect a great Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only in the Government of the Church, but in the Worſhip and Doctrines of it alſo, and too juſt motives to engage them to make a more particular Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It may not leſs appear by what we have ſaid concerning the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which ſhe aſcribes to her ſelf over mens Conſciences, that her pretenſions have no Foundation, and that all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful have a Right to Judge of the matters of Religion by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to diſcern what is good from what is ill. We have ſeen nevertheleſs that our Fathers were not moved ſo publickly to make uſe of their Right, but by an extream and utmoſt Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and if they will do them Juſtice, they ought freely to acknowledge, what the Author of the Prejudices has not dared to deny, that they had a ſufficient Call, to go as far, as a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Separation, and openly to refuſe to believe and to Act, what their Conſciences ſhould not allow them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
               <p>But as that Motion of Conſcience was not Univerſal, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all thoſe of their Time, and as it had encountred the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of a great Body, that was in poſſeſſion of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Latin Church, they have laboured to render it odious by all ſorts of ways, and even thoſe, who were not able directly to condemn it, have not failed to ſearch out divers pretences to cry it down; and having nothing to ſay againſt their Actions, they have taken up ſomething againſt their perſons. This is that that the moſt of our Adverſaries endeavour with great Care; this is that, that their Writers of Controverſies and Miſſionaries, who are ſpread abroad on all ſides among us, and who make uſe of all ſorts of ways to gain <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> do, even now, all their
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97749:97"/>
days; and this is that, that the Author of the Prejudices in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, has done.</p>
               <p>His Argument may be well nigh reduced to this: That there is no likelyhood that God committed the care of Reforming his Church, to perſons whoſe Life and Conduct was Diſorderly and Scandalous. And the Concluſion that he pretends to draw from it is, that we ought to reject, without any further Examination, that Reformation, and to put our ſelves into the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It will be no difficult matter to ſhew him, that, Bleſſed be God, we have as to what concerns us, on every ſide matter of Edification, from the manners of thoſe who were firſt of all made uſe of, in ſo Holy and ſo Neceſſary a Work; and this we ſhall preſently make out. But before I come to that, I am obliged to tell him, that his way of Reaſoning, is the moſt captious and the moſt contrary to the intereſts of the true Religion that can be imagined, and that it is contrary even to the Intereſts of that Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which it would defend. I ſay in the firſt place that it is captious, For ſince our Fathers Reformed themſelves only out of the motion of their Conſciences, which dictated to them that they ought to do it for the Glory of God and their own Salvation, how can he pretend that we who have followed them out of the ſame Reaſon, can revoke an Action which we believe to be juſt and lawful, out of meerly Forreign Conſiderations, taken from the perſons of thoſe who excited us to do it, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it does not appear to us that the Conſciences of our Fathers, and our own were deceived, and that our Action is unjuſt in the Foundation? If the Law of the Conſcience obliges us, and gives us a right to ſeparate our ſelves, at leaſt Negatively, how can we depart from that Separation on the account of perſonal Actions, in which neither our Fathers nor our ſelves have had any part, and which have nothing of common with our Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Our Reformation being good and juſt, as we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it is, is it not true, that we ought to hold our ſelves to it, whatſoever they tell us further of the Paſſions of <hi>Luther,</hi> or of the Marriage of ſome <hi>Monks?</hi> Theſe things are wholly ſeparate; For our Fathers might very well Read the Writings of <hi>Luther,</hi> and hear the Preaching of theſe <hi>Monks</hi> who ſhould diſcover to them the Abuſes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they might very well Reform themſelves in the end, out of a motion of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſtirred up by their Teachings, without either approving
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97749:97"/>
or Canonizing their other Actions. But they will ſay, to have avoided falling into that motion of Conſcience, your Fathers ought not to have heard them. And why ought they not? That ſame motion that their Teachings ſtirred up, and that produced a Reformation, ſufficiently notes that they ought. But whether they ought, or whether they ought not, they did hear them, the thing was done; and that which they heard having cauſed that Sentiment of their Conſciences which obliged them to Reform themſelves, we ſhould be impious if we ſhould quit that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, without any ones ſatisfying us about that Sentiment, or ſhewing us that it is ill, and fit to be condemned. But that they can never do by thoſe perſonal Actions which have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to it; elſe, they would be bound to condemn the comfort which we every day receive from the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> under a pretence that <hi>David</hi> had committed Adultery with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and to reject that Inſtruction that we gather from the Books of <hi>Solomon,</hi> under a pretence that <hi>Solomon</hi> was not ſo conſtant as he ought to have been in the Worſhip of the True God. There is then nothing elſe but a Sophiſm in all that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if that way of Reaſoning is captious, it is not leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the intereſts of the True Religion, ſince it would have us Judge of the Reformation, by the Quality of the perſons who Preached it, and not by it ſelf or the Nature of the things it Treats of, which would Eſtabliſh a Principle whoſe Uſe could not but be very pernicious to the Church; For if we ought not to conſider its Doctrine in it ſelf, but to judge of it by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſhould teach it us, how could any one diſcern the Angels of Darkneſs, when they ſhould be diſguiſed into Angels of Light, and be able to know the falſe Prophets when they ſhould work ſigns and wonders even to deceive if it were poſſible the very Elect? How could any know thoſe Impoſtors and thoſe Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who come in Sheeps cloathing but inwardly are ravening Wolves? Moreover would it be a hard matter for thoſe men who ſhould be intereſted againſt the ſound Doctrine to invent a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Calumnies againſt the perſons of the Teachers of it, and how many did they invent in the beginning againſt the Apoſtles, and the Primitive Chriſtians, whom they repreſented to the people as the moſt wicked among men? I confeſs it is a great means of Edification, that thoſe who Preach a good Doctrine confirm it by good Examples, and that on the contrary, it is Scandalous when their works do not correſpond with their words. But never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97749:98"/>
it does not follow, that one ought to receive a Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſpoken by perſons of an honeſt life, or to reject it for the contrary Reaſon; for this Maxim would make us very often reject Truths and receive Hereſies. It is then certain that we ought to examine that Word in it ſelf without any dependance on thoſe who Preach it; For Truth is not in Men, but in God alone, ſhe cannot change her Nature nor loſe her right through the Vices of its Miniſters. If our Fathers were Reformed by the Authority of <hi>Luther,</hi> or by that of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> they would have ſome Reaſon to draw us back to the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their manners, ſince in that Caſe, they would treat of that that would either eſtabliſh or deſtroy the Right which they would have had to believe their meer words. But how many times have our Fathers and we proteſted, that we do not believe that which our Reformers ſaid, becauſe they ſaid it, but becauſe they proved it; and becauſe thoſe things appeared ſufficiently evident in themſelves. We look upon them only as perſons whom God made uſe of to teach men their Duty; they diſcovered it, our Fathers ſaw it, we ſee it alſo, and it is on the ſight of this Duty alone, and not on their Authority, that the Reformation depends. As it frequently falls out that our very Enemies make us know our Duty in reproaching us with our faults: ſuppoſe we that a <hi>Jew</hi> or ſome other Infidel ſhould have accuſed and convinced the Latins that they had corrupted their Chriſtianity, and had not preſerved the Goſpel in that State wherein Chriſt and his Apoſtles left it, is it not true, that without any regard to the perſon, the Latins would be bound to do that which our Fathers have done, and that the Quality of him who ſhould have ſo reproached them, would not have been a ſufficient excuſe before God, to hinder them from the doing of their duty. It is then very evident that we ought to Judge of thoſe matters by the matters themſelves, and not by the perſons who teach them to us, and by Conſequence, that the Principle of the Author of Prejudices is falſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to true Piety.</p>
               <p>As to what he ſays, that there is no likelyhood that God has committed the Care of Reforming his Church, to Scandalous Perſons; I anſwer, that God has committed to all his Faithful, the Care of Reforming themſelves, and to all his Paſtors that of Exhorting their Flocks. If it falls out, that among thoſe Paſtors who have acquitted themſelves, in that reſpect, of their charges, there ſhould have been ſome few who did Actions worthy to be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97749:98"/>
blamed, that ought not to create any Prejudice againſt the Word, nor put a ſtop to the motion of the Conſciences of the Faithful, any more then the defection of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> or his exceſſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the <hi>Jews</hi> ought to have hindred the Converſion of People to Chriſtianity. The Miniſters that God makes uſe of, are men who have their faults, and faults ſometimes of the higheſt nature, as may appear from the Example of <hi>Aaron</hi> who encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in Idolatry, and of <hi>Jonas</hi> who fled to <hi>Tarſis</hi> when he was bound to have gone and Preached to <hi>Ninive;</hi> but their faults make the word of God loſe nothing either of its Truth, or its Authority.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a very ſtrange thing that the Author of the Prejudices has not taken any heed, in laying down a very bad Argument againſt us, of furniſhing us with a very good one againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in that Eſtate, wherein it was in the days of our Fathers. For if we ought to Judge of the Doctrine by the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities or the Actions of thoſe who Teach it I pray conſider, what Judgment could our Fathers make of that Religion that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and its Prelats taught, and whether they had not all the grounds in the World to reform themſelves. If there be no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood that God committed the Care of Reforming his Church to perſons who were guilty of Scandalous Actions, there is far leſs that God has given Infallibility, and a Soveraign Authority over mens Conſciences to ſuch perſons as the <hi>Popes</hi> and Prelats in the days of our Fathers were, according to the Deſcription which the unſuſpected Authors that we have quoted, give us of them, and divers others that we might here add to them if we ſo pleaſed. And that which makes theſe two Arguments differ, is, that his concludes upon a Principle which we maintain to be falſe and ill; where ours concludes upon a Principle which he himſelf admits and acknowledges to be good; ſo that in his own Judgment, we have a ſufficient Fundation whereon to Eſtabliſh the Juſtice of our Reformation.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee, nevertheleſs, of what Nature thoſe Actions are wherewith he reproaches our firſt Reformers. <hi>I will not,</hi> ſays he, <note place="margin">

I do not pretend to detain my ſelf in any but thoſe publick things that are ſo manifeſt, and ſo expoſed to the Eyes of all the World.</hi> I confeſs he has Reaſon, not to ſtay upon all that which his Paſſion has invented againſt them; for who knows not, that Calumny has no bounds eſpecially when intereſt and paſſion
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97749:99"/>
ſtir it up? Our Reformers are not the only perſons who have been attacked after that manner, The <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid of <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt that he had a Devil, and of Jeſus Chriſt that he was a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> a glutton and a Wine-bibber, a friend of <hi>Publicans</hi> and ſinners. <hi>If then they have called the Father of the Family</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>what will they not ſay of his Servants?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what then are thoſe things that are ſo Publick, ſo manifeſt, and ſo expoſed to the Eyes of the whole World, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Prejudices has found fit to be inſiſted upon. <hi>That new</hi>

                  <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was Preached only out of the mouths of thoſe</hi> Monks, <hi>who had quitted their habit and their profeſſion, ouly to contract Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Marriages, or from the mouths of thoſe Priests who had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated that Vow of Virginity which the Calviniſts themſelves confeſs to have been impoſed on all Prieſts, and on all Monks in the Weſt, by divers Councils, and on all the Monks, and all the Biſhops in the Eaſt, and the first fruit of this Doctrine was the ſetting open the Cloiſters, the taking off the Vails of the Nuns, the aboliſhing of all Auſterities, and overthrowing of all manner of diſcipline in the Church.</hi> This is that that forces him to ſay, <hi>That the Reformers ſtruck mens Eyes, with a Spectacle that could not but create horrour, according to the common Idea's of Piety and Vertue, whech the Fathers give us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author of the Prejudices will not take it ill, that in order to our Anſwering him, we muſt put him in mind, what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf exhorts us to, <hi>To Tranſport our ſelves into another Time then</hi>

                  <hi>that wherein we are at preſent, and to repreſent to our ſelves our Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in its firſt riſe, and during the firſt years wherein it was made amidſt the Switzers and in France.</hi> Upon his thus placing us in that State which he deſires, we will declare to him, that, The general Depravation which reign'd amidſt the <hi>Monks</hi> and the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> is to our Eyes <hi>a Spectacle worthy of horror,</hi> according to the common <hi>Ideas</hi> of Piety and Vertue which the holy Scriptures and right Reaſon give us. We will tell him, that that which Scandalizes us, is to ſee that for a reſpect of a purely humane Order, they endured for ſo long a time a diſorder that diſhonoured the Latin Church, that drew upon it God's Judgments, and that laid open the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Church to an everlaſting reproach. It is in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting of thoſe Infamies and thoſe Impurities, that the true zeal of Chriſtians ought to conſiſt, and it is to the ſearching out of a ſolid remedy for them that one ought to apply the Diſcipline of the Church, and not to keep them up under a pretence of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97749:99"/>
raſh Vows and a Caelibaſy that God never commanded. If the Author of the Prejudices is more Scandalized to ſee Prieſts and Monks Married, then to ſee them plunged into all the filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Debauchery, I cannot hinder my ſelf from telling him that he makes Chriſtianity a Law of Hypocriſy, and it may be yet ſomewhat worſe; for Hypocriſy does not content it ſelf with meer Names, ſhe would have fair appearances without, of thoſe things which ſhe really rejects. Whereas for him, he rejects not only the things but their appearances alſo, ſuffering patiently the loſs of any more ſeeing either the things, or their appearances, provided we do not meddle with thoſe empty names of Caelibacy and Virginity. But true Moral Chriſtianity inſpires other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, ſhe would have us honour that Caelibacy and Virginity as gifts that come from God; but ſhe would alſo have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and horrour for thoſe ſpecious names when they ſhall be applyed to thoſe beaſtlineſſes and exceſſes which both God and Men condemn. She would have us in that Caſe inſtead of being Scandalized to ſee a falſe Caelibacy made void, and a vain ſhadow of Virginity aboliſhed, that we ſhould on the contrary be edified to ſee them got out from thoſe ſnares of ſin, and to have recourſe to a lawful Marriage that God has allowed unto all, and that he has even commanded unto thoſe who have not received the gift of Continency. It was in the View of this that our Fathers lookt upon the Marriage of thoſe Prieſts and Monks as the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of an unjuſt Law, contrary to the expreſs words of Saint <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul, if they cannot contain, let them Marry,</hi> and which moreover had produced ſuch miſcheivous effects as it was no longer poſſible for them to indure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> ſays the Author of Prejudices, <hi>we do not intend to ſpeak of the Intereſts of Families, of Marriage, nor of baſe and fleſhly</hi>

                  <hi>paſſions in the lives of thoſe Great Biſhops, and all thoſe great men of old, whom God oppoſed to the Hereſies that roſe up againſt his Church, as</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> Saint <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome and</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine. They were all of them eminent in Sanctity, in a diſingagement from Intereſts; and continency was always joyned to their Miniſtry.</hi> We may ſay of that Author, without doing him an injury, that he does not write ill, what he thinks, but that he ſcarce thinks well, that which he writes, and that which I ſhall here come to ſhew is an Example of it; for he here lays down a great Trifle under the ſhew of one of the faireſt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97749:100"/>
things in the World. Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and thoſe other Biſhops were not Marryed. I ſee it, but who told him, That they did it by vertue of a general Law that forbad Biſhops to be Married? Who told him, that divers other Biſhops, who were not leſs great then thoſe, for their Sanctity, their diſengage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the intereſts of the World, never lived in Marriage, as Saint <hi>Spiridion,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the Father of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory Nyſſcne,</hi> Saint <hi>Proſper,</hi> Saint <hi>Hilary, Sydonius Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaris, Syneſius,</hi> Saint <hi>Eupſychus</hi> of <hi>Ceſarea</hi> and divers others? Who told him, that Prieſts were not generally Married in the Primitive Church, whether it were in the Eaſt, or in the Weſt, as may be juſtified by a Thouſand Proofs? And in fine, that they do not vainly wrangle in ſaying, that thoſe Biſhops or thoſe Prieſts were really Married before their Ordination; but that they were not during their Prelateſhip or Prieſthood, whether it were that their Wives were dead, and whether they were put away, it is good to Note what the Hiſtory of Saint <hi>Eupſychus</hi> of <hi>Ceſaria</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> relates, whom Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> formally called a Biſhop, ſuffered Martyrdom within a little after his Marriage, being as <note place="margin">

What then can the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Prejudices conclude from the Example of Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and thoſe others unmarried unleſs this, that each one was in that regard in his full liberty, and that as there were ſome that did marry, ſo there were alſo ſome that did not? Did he need for ſo little a matter to declaim Rhetorically, and to ſet down theſe great words with an Emphaſis, <hi>That our Reformers ſtruck mens Eyes with a Spectacle, that could not but Create horrour according to the general</hi> Idea's <hi>of Piety and Vertue that the Fatheri give us.</hi> I ſhall not ſay, that the <hi>Idea's</hi> of Piety and Virtue do not depend on the Fathers, but on the Goſpel and right Reaſon, and that it is by them that we ought to judge the Fathers, and not thoſe by the Fathers. I will not ſay that the Fathers of the purer Antiquity, are ſo far from giving us an horrour at the Marriage of <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> aſſures us on the contrary, that what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to <hi>Titus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97749:100"/>
Marriage, and to ſhew that Marriage is not only an Innocent thing <hi>but that it is ſo Honourable alſo, that according to him it may be elèvated as high as the Epiſcopal Throne.</hi> But I will only ſay, and I will ſay it with an aſſurance of its being approved by all honeſt and upright men, that the Marriage of Church-men, which of it ſelf is an honeſt and Holy State practiſed under the Old Law, practiſed in the primitive Church, and Authoriſed by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot be conſidered but with the greateſt Edification when it ſhall be ſet in oppoſition to the diſorders, and filthineſſes that Caelibacy has produced, which is but a purely humane Inſtitution, without any lawful Foundation. It belongs therefore to thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to tell us, whether they are much edified by the lives that their Prieſts led, in the Age of the Reformation, and by that permiſſion which they gave them, for a Sum of Money, publickly to keep their Concubines. They are to tell us, whether they have no horrour for thoſe ſtrange aſſertions of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, <hi>That a Prieſt Sins leſs who through the infirmity of the fleſh</hi>

                  <hi>falls into the Sin of Fornication, then if he ſhould marry, and that it is a leſs evil for Prieſts to burn then to Marry.</hi> As for us, we have that general precept of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which has its uſe as well in reſpect of Church-men, as others, <hi>if they cannot contain let them Marry,</hi> and the Doctrine of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Marriage</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But the Author of the Prejudices ſays, <hi>That the Law of</hi> Celiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>whether it were juſt or unjust, or whether it did not begin if they will have it ſo, till</hi> Pope Siricius's <hi>time, they cannot at leaſt deny, That the ſpirit of God did not carry out all the Famous Biſhops of Old, and thoſe who have been eminent for Sanctity, to imitate Saint</hi> Paul, <hi>and to follow that Counſel which he gives to renounce Marriage, to ſet themſelves wholly to pleaſe God, and that the ſame ſpirit did not from the very firſt Ages of the Church inſpire a very great number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of both Sexes to remain Virgins all their Lives, as Saint</hi> Juſtin <hi>witneſſes, and</hi> Origen <hi>againſt</hi> Celſus. <hi>Whence then comes it to paſs that there ſhould have nothing appeared of that inſtinct, or of thoſe motions of Gods ſpirit in the pretended Reformers, nor in the Societies which they have eſtabliſhed, any more than all thoſe other Graces which ſhone ſo Illuſtriouſly in the Saints of Antiquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is yet further, another example of that which I ſaid juſt before, that that Author does not take too much care of that which he writes. For can there be a raſher thing in the World
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97749:101"/>
than to offer to thruſt ones ſelf into the Counſels of God, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterially to decide, what qualities the Reformers ought to have had? Continency and Virginity are the Cifts that God diſtributes to men as he pleaſes, but it is what he has given only to ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it no ways follows either that their Perſons were not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him, nor, that he could not make uſe of them in the greateſt works of his Providence. <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, as the Scripture calls him; was not he Married? <hi>Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and the twelve <hi>Patriarchs</hi> who founded the Church of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> were not they? <hi>Moſes</hi> the deliverer of the Antient People, by whom God gave his Law, and by whom he had wrought ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miracles, was not he? <hi>Aaron</hi> and all the High-Preiſts who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, were not they? All thoſe Calls and divers others whereof the Scripture ſpeaks, were methinks, moſt weighty and for the greateſt part extraordinary, and nevertheleſs we do not ſee, that God in giving them, has made any Reflection upon the Advice of the Authour of the Prejudices. Who ever gave him a right to lay down Rules with ſuch Authority of what God ought to do, and what he ſhould not have done, and by that means to raiſe himſelf ſo high as to be a Cenſor of God's Actions? He ought at leaſt to have called it to mind, that Jeſus Chriſt made no ſcruple to chuſe married men, out of whom to make his Apoſtles and Evangeliſts. The Scripture mentions the Mother-in-law of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that is to ſay his Wives Mother; for that word in Greek can be taken in no other ſence but that. It ſpeaks alſo of the four Daughters of <hi>Philip</hi> the Evangeliſt. The Authour of the Commentaries upon the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> under the name of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> aſſures us that all the Apoſtles had Wives except Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>John;</hi> and Saint <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſay the ſame thing without any exception. Virginity is not then an inſeparable character of the Call of God, as the Authour of the Prejudices would perſwade us.</p>
               <p>But after that firſt aſſault of the Authour of the Prejudices, which was made with all the weapons that he firſt found in his hands, he reproaches the Reformers, with the little fruit that their Preaching wrought for the Sanctification of thoſe people who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them. <hi>Their Miniſters themſelves,</hi> ſays he, <hi>have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the Evidence of the Truth, to acknowledge, That all their pretended Reformation did not produce any Renovation of the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, and that it had rather increaſed then leſſened the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of thoſe who embraced it;</hi> and for that he produces the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:97749:101"/>
of ſome Miniſters as of <hi>Capito</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, and of <hi>Luther</hi> againſt the Vices of their Age. I acknowledge that if they compare our Fathers manners and ours, with the Grace that God has given us in renewing his Goſpel in the midſt of us, they would find but too much reaſon to make us cover our Faces with confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we were unworthy of ſo great a Favour. I confeſs alſo that there may be many found among thoſe who at firſt embraced the Reformation, who inſtead of profiting by it, abuſed it, as the beſt things may be abuſed. But I ſay, that they ought not to inſult over that Confeſſion that we make in that regard; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that a Doctrine is not the leſs found, for not being ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved as it deſerves, we can yet further ſay for our ſelves, and ſay it to the Glory of that God whom we ſerve, that he has poured forth a ſufficiently abundant meaſure of his bleſſing on our Fathers, and that if any compare their manners with thoſe of the other Party who rejected the Reformation, they will find reaſon enough to confeſs, that God was in the midſt of us. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that they might not ſee there thoſe Phariſaical Devotions of which the hypocrites and ſuperſtitious make a vain ſhew: They might not ſee there thoſe men who publiſh to all the world their Mortifications and their Faſts, who withdraw themſelves out of the crowd, to make themſelves to be more taken notice of, and who never enter into their ſecret retirements but with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eaſe to be able to mix themſelves in all that that is common in the World. But they may there behold a ſolid Piety, plain and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, without Art and Affection, a true fear of offending God, with a free and open carriage, which never ſought to hide it ſelf by diſtinctions and illuſions; but in good earneſt to follow the dictates of Conſcience, without ſaying, to hinder them from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Duty, either what will become of us, or what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of our Brethren or Siſters? Becauſe they knew that thoſe Events were in the hand of God, and that poor worldly intereſt ought never to prevail over the love of the Truth.</p>
               <p>As to the Wars that the Author of the Prejudices imputes to the Reformation, it had been, methinks, his prudence not to have turned the Diſpute upon a Matter, on which he well knows that we have but too many things to ſay for our Juſtification. If ſome Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> took up Arms to defend themſelves againſt the aſſaults of their Enemies, they thought that the Juſtice and Law of Nations authoriſed that defence, and that being Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aign in their States, they were bound to protect their Subjects and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97749:102"/>
to preſerve that Truſt that God had put into their hands. And as for thoſe Commotions that hapned in <hi>France</hi> in the times of the Reformation, there is no perſon who is ignorant of their true Cauſes. It is true, that the Intereſt of our Religion had ſome part in them; but it had at leaſt the good fortune, to be found joyned with that of the preſerving of that great Kingdom to its juſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſours, againſt thoſe pernitious deſigns which made but too great a noiſe afterwards; and whatſoever ſad Remembrances the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Prejudices has awakened, by his undeſerved reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, yet we ſhall not fail to maintain, that the blood of our Fathers was very well ſpent for ſo good a Cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was not afraid of animating his followers to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Blood, by thoſe horrible words which are to be found in his firſt Tome of his Works of</hi> Wittingburg <hi>Edition; If we hang up Robbers on Gibbets, if we puniſh Hereticks and Thieves with the Sword, why do not we aſſault with all our Forces thoſe</hi> Cardinals <hi>and thoſe</hi> Popes, <hi>and all that ſcum of the</hi> Roman Sodom, <hi>that ceaſes not to corrupt the Church of God, why do we not embrue our hands in their Blood?</hi> It is certain, that there can ſcarce be any paſſage related after a more invenomed and baſe manner, than the Authour of the Prejudices relates that, and this will appear if they well but make theſe following Obſervations. 1. That he ſeparates thoſe words from the ſequel of the Diſcourſe to give them quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sence than <hi>Luther</hi> intended by them, which is, to ſpeak Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, a kind of falſification, more dangerous then that of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the words of a Sentance. 2. That he would make us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine that thoſe words are addreſt to the followers of <hi>Luther,</hi> to animate them to Blood and Slaughter, which is a perfect Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. 3. That he quotes them not as ſpoken upon a ſuppoſition, but as ſpoken purely and ſimply, which is further contrary to the Truth. Behold then what the matter truly was; <hi>Sylveſter Prierias</hi> Maſter of the Sacred Palace at <hi>Rome,</hi> having wrote againſt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s Doctrine concerning the <hi>Pope,</hi> and in particular againſt his Appeal to a Council, had peremptorily maintained, That it was not lawful to Appeal from the <hi>Pope</hi> to a Council, becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> was a Soveraign Judge, and liable to no Appeal, and that thoſe who ſued out ſuch Appeals were caſt out of the Church and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate. That the <hi>Pope</hi> alone was the Infallible Rule of Truth, whoſe deciſions were certain and irrefragable without a Council; where thoſe of a Council were nothing without the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor bound any perſon if they were not authoriſed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſo
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97749:102"/>
that whatſoever ſhould not receive the Doctrine of the <hi>Pope</hi> as the Infallible Rule of Faith, from whom the Holy Scripture it ſelf heretofore and now, derives all its force, he is a Heretick; and many other Propoſitions of that nature. Upon that <hi>Luther</hi> writes, that, <hi>All thoſe things were maintained only out of a hatred of a General Council, and to hinder any one from being heard who ſhould give any ſuccour to the afflicted Church. That the</hi> Popes <hi>Creatures ſeeing well that they could not hinder a Council, began to ſeek out ways to elude it, by ſaying, that the</hi> Pope <hi>was above a Council, and that without his Authority, none could either be called or held; in a word, that a Council had not any Power, but that the</hi> Pope <hi>alone was the Infallible Rule of Truth. That it ſeemed to him then, that if the Fury of thoſe men took place, there would not further remain any other Remedy but this; That the Emperour, the Kings and Princes ſhould make uſe of their Arms againſt thoſe publick Poſts, and that thoſe matters ſhould not be decided by Words, but by the Sword.</hi> In the cloſe of which, he adjoyns thoſe words which the Author of the Prejudices has related.</p>
               <p>So that his meaning is not to Animate his Followers to Blood and Slaughter, as the Author of the Prejudices inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it; but only to draw an abſur'd conſequence from his Adverſaries <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> which is, That if he would alſo take away the only Remedy that was left to provide againſt the deſolations of the Church in aſſembling a Free Council, he would ſet the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, the Kings and Princes in Arms againſt the <hi>Popes</hi> and the <hi>Cardinals</hi> and all the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and would reduce things to the utmoſt extremity. I my ſelf will not ſay, that there may not be ſomewhat too violent in thoſe kind of expreſſions; but after all, his deſign is not to animate his Followers to Blood and Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but only to let <hi>Sylveſter</hi> ſee the neceſſity of a Council, that might judge above the <hi>Pope,</hi> from that inconvenience, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would remain no other courſe to the Emperour, to Kings and Princes, to re-eſtabliſh Order in the Church, then to make uſe of their compelling power. And that further appears to be the Sence, becauſe he adds immediately after, <hi>That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>whether it were of Divine Right, or whether it were of Human, could not be urged, but by the Precept,</hi> Honour thy Father and thy Mother, <hi>which in granting him to be a Father, puts him under the firſt Table; ſo that if he ſhould do any thing in oppoſition to them, he might be admoniſhed, and even accuſed</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:97749:103"/>
                  <hi>by the leaſt of the Faithful.</hi> Which let us ſee that his meaning was no other than that which I have repreſented.</p>
               <p>I confeſs it were to be wiſhed that <hi>Luther</hi> had obſerved more of the mean, than he did, in his manner of writing, and that, with that great and invincible Courage, joyned with that ardent zeal for the Truth, and with that unſhaken Conſtancy, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhewed, there might have been diſcernable more of ſtayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and moderation. But thoſe faults which moſt frequently proceed from Temperament, do not take away mens eſteem of ſuch, when beſides them they may ſee a good foundation of Piety in them, and Vertues Heroical throughout, as they may diſcern-to have ſhone in <hi>Luther.</hi> For they cannot ceaſe extolling the zeal of <hi>Lucifer</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cagliari,</hi> nor admiring the eminent qualities of Saint <hi>Jerom,</hi> although they do acknowledge too much ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and paſſion in their Style. And it may be that there was even ſome particular neceſſity in the time of the Reformation to uſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of expreſſion, the more eaſily to rouſe men out of that profound ſleep wherein they had lain for ſo long a time. However it be, I had rather come to agree that <hi>Luther</hi> ought to have been more moderate in his expreſſions, and if the Authour of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices would be coutented with complaining of the ſharpneſs of his Style, he ſhould be alſo contented, for every anſwer to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, that hereafter, he will not himſelf any more imitate that which he condemns in another; eſpecially, in writing againſt thoſe, who having lived in the laſt Age, cannot have given him any perſonal occaſion, to be carried away againſt them with paſſion, after the manner that he has been, in many places of his Book.</p>
               <p>If in the Judgment that he paſſes on them, he would not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Charity, he ought, at leaſt, to hearken to Juſtice, and not to have charged them with foul Accuſations, under the pretences of having miſtaken and miſunderſtood; I place in this Rank, that <note place="margin">Chap. 2. Pag. 57. 58.</note> which he furthers forms againſt <hi>Luther</hi> in theſe words. <hi>There ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any one,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but</hi> Luther, <hi>who durſt to boaſt in his Printed Works, that he had had a long conference with the Devil, that he had been convinced by his reaſons that private Maſſes were an abuſe, and that that was the motive that had carried him out to aboliſh them. But common Sence,</hi> adds he, <hi>has always made all others conclude, not only that he was in an exceſs of extravagance, to take the Devil for a Maſter of Truth, and to give himſelf up to be his Diſciple; but that</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:97749:103"/>
                  <hi>all thoſe who had any marks that they were his Miniſters and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, and who had not any lawful Authority in the Church to make themſelves be heard, did not deſerve, that any ſhould apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to them, or that they ſhould ſo much as examine their Opinions.</hi> Behold here <hi>Luther,</hi> a Diſciple, a Miniſter and Inſtrument of the Devil, if one will believe the Author of the Prejudices.</p>
               <p>To refute that Calumny, we need but to repreſent in a few words what that buſineſs was that he there ſpeaks of. <hi>Luther</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Style of the Monks of thoſe days, who were wont by a Figure of Rhetorick to fill their Books with their exploits againſt the Devil, relates, that being one time awakened in the midſt of a dark night, the Devil began to accuſe him for having made the people of God Idolatrize, and to have been guilty of Idolatry himſelf for the ſpace of fifteen years, wherein he had ſaid private Maſſes, and that the Reaſon of that Accuſation was, that he could not have any thing conſecrated in thoſe private Maſſes; from whence it followed that he had adored, and had made others adore meer Bread and meer Wine, and not the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. He adds, that that accuſation ſtruck him at his heart, and that to defend himſelf he alledged that he was a Prieſt, that he had done nothing but by the Order of his Superiors, and that he had always pronounced the words of Conſecration very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, with the beſt intention in the World; from whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that he could ſee no reaſon to have the Crime of Idolatry laid to his Charge: That notwithſtanding the Tempter did not fail to reply, that thoſe excuſes would nothing avail him in that the <hi>Turks</hi> and the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> obeyed alſo the Order of their Superiours, with a very good intention, and that, nevertheleſs they were truly Idolaters. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this,</hi> he ſays, <hi>that he was ſeized with ſuch a violent agitation of Spirit, accompanied with a general ſweat over all the parts of his Body, and a confuſion wherein he found himſelf, having been made to underſtand that his defence was not Solid, ſince beſides a good intention and obedience to his Superiors, he ought to have examined further whether the Action diſputed was good in it ſelf and agreeable to God, and on that he made a Reſolution to renounce all private Maſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Diſcourſe of <hi>Luther</hi> there, upon all which I ſhall make no ſcruple to profeſs, that that manner of expreſſing things under the form of a Combat with the Devil, appears to me indeed, a little remote from common Uſe, and makes that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:97749:104"/>
return into my thoughts, that <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf has ſaid ſomewhere in his Works, <hi>Pium Lectorem oro ut iſta legat cum Judicio, &amp; ſciat me fuiſſe aliquando Monachum.</hi> In effect he could not wholly throw off, as he would the Stile of the Convent. But I ſay, notwithſtanding, there is nothing in all that which is remote from the Duty of an honeſt man, nor which may not be intirely innocent, whether one take that Narration Literally, or as a kind of Figure and Parable. He ſays, that the Devil accuſed him in his heart, That ſignifies, that he repreſented to himſelf, in his Conſcience, the Accuſations that the Devil might one day form againſt him, before the Tribunal of God; What crime was there in all that? Is not the Devil called in Scripture, <hi>The Accuſer of the Faithful?</hi> And does not the Hiſtory of <hi>Job</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce him as appearing before the Throne of God, to render the Piety of that Holy-man ſuſpected? <hi>Luther</hi> adjoyns, that in his firſt Defences, he alleadged his Prieſthood, his Obedience to his Superiours, his good intention and exactneſs. What is there extraordinary in all that? It is not very natural that thoſe ſorts of pretences ſhould come in to the ſuccours of a burthened Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? He ſays in the ſequel that theſe Defences were oppoſed by the Accuſer, as inſufficient and uncapable to hide him from the ſin of Idolatry. What is there here that may deſerve any blame? May not the Devil ſpeak Truths in Accuſing us? Does not he know how to exaggerate our ſins, and ſtrongly to oppoſe our vain Excuſes? At laſt <hi>Luther</hi> ſays, that to render thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Accuſer unſervicable for the future, he reſolved within himſelf to abandon private Maſſes, which ſerved for the ground of that Accuſation. What is there in all that, that may not be the Motion of a good Conſcience? He would ſhut the mouth of the Adverſary, and take away from him any means of accuſing him before God, as if he had been a wicked perſon and an Idolater, he would ſnatch away from him thoſe weapons that he made uſe of to combat and terrify him. Let the Author of the Prejudices turn all that as he pleaſes, he can never find it in a bad ſence. Every Chriſtian is bound to order his conduct ſo that he may be ſheltered from the Attempts of the Devil, <hi>for he is a Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, who walks daily about us, ſeeking whom</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. <hi>Pet.</hi> ch. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>he may devour,</hi> and when to put a ſtop to the Accuſations of that Enemy, a man Examines his own Actions, with a deſign to amend them, and to forſake the evil of them, He had need be a good,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97749:104"/>
Detractour and well skilled in Calumniating, that can take a pretence from that to ſay of him, That he has taken the Devil for a Maſter of Truth, and that he has given up himſelf to him to be his Diſeiple, his Miniſter and Inſtrument. Would the Author of the Prejudices take it well, that we ſhould give thoſe horrible Titles to <hi>Dominic,</hi> one of the greateſt Saints of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> under a pretence that <hi>Antonine</hi> has Wrote of him ſomewhat like that we have ſeen of <hi>Luther?</hi> He ſays, <hi>That</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antonius. Chron.</hi> 3. <hi>Parte tit.</hi> 23. Cap. 4. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Dominic ſaw the Devil one Night, holding in his Iron hands a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which he Read to him by the Light of a Lamp, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving asked him, what that meant which he Read, the Devil anſwered him, That it was a Catalogue of the Sins of his Brethen. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which Dominic having commanded him to leave the Paper to him, and the Devil doing it accordingly, that Saint found therein certain things, about which,</hi> ſays <hi>Antonine, he Corrected his Religious.</hi> See here then, according to the Stile of the Author of the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, <hi>the Diſciple, the Miniſter, and the Inſtrument of the Devil;</hi> Not only becauſe it was he who taught him the diſorders of his Covent, but alſo, becauſe the Accuſations of the Devil gave him an occaſion, and a Motive to make new Orders in his Society, neither more nor leſs, then thoſe that <hi>Luther</hi> made uſe of for the Aboliſhing of private Maſſes. But as it would be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to defend <hi>Dominic,</hi> by ſaying, that he did but make uſe of that Paper againſt the Intention of that Accuſer, and to ſhut his Mouth for the future. So alſo it is not a difficult thing to juſtify <hi>Luther</hi> by ſaying preciſely the ſame thing, ſince that was in effect againſt the intention of the Devil, that he made uſe of his Accuſation, and that he did ſo, only to confound him, and to take from him for the future, any ground of Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I will end this Chapter, in deſiring the Authour of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices to Remember, that we have ſeen not a long time ſince, men taken up in defending themſelves, not only againſt thoſe common reports, that are ſpread abroad of them amongſt the People; but alſo, againſt thoſe publick Writings that charge them with very ſtrange Accuſations. We have heard their <note place="margin">The ſecond Letter of <hi>Monſieur Arnaud.</hi> 2. Part Pag. 110. 111.</note> Complaints, <hi>that they have ſeen, ſo many Mouths of Calumny opened to tear them, So many Enemies conſpiring together to deſtroy their Honour and Reputation, and thoſe Enemies vomiting up againſt them all that Hell can invent of the blackeſt and fouleſt Calumnies,</hi>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS the Book of the Prejudices is nothing elſe but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed heap of Objections, and unjuſt Accuſations, that the Author of that Book has piled up one upon another, without Connexion, and without Order, So I find my ſelf conſtrained, that I may not break off the Connexion of my Subject, to break off that of his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Therefore after having anſwered his third where his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives begin, againſt the manners and conduct of the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, I ſhall diſmiſs the Examination of his 4th. 5th. and 6th. Chapters, where he Treats about the Call of the Miniſters of our Communion to my Fourth Part, and where he Treats of the Right that we have to a Goſpel Miniſtry, and that which he afterwards ſays in the 7th. 8th. and 9th. Chapters concerning our pretended Schiſm, to my Third Part wherein we ſhall Treat of our Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and I ſhall now paſs on to the Examination of his 10th. 11th. 12th. and 13th. wherein he renews the ſame perſonal Invectives againſt the firſt Reformers. But as thoſe Chapters are compoſed of almoſt nothing elſe but frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matters, ſwelled up with Declamatory Exaggerations, by Injuries and Paſſion. We ſhall not think it unfit, if ſetting aſide all that in them which is to no purpoſe, or too paſſionate, we ſet down in a few Words all that that is more Eſſential in thoſe Objections, and that we Anſwer them alſo in a few Words.</p>
               <p>1. Objection, is, That <hi>Andrew Caroloſtadius</hi> Arch-Deacon of <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> whom <hi>Melanchton</hi> runs down as a brutiſh Fellow, without wit, and without Learning who embraced the Fanatical Doctrine of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> was the firſt who had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to aſſault, the Doctrine of the Real preſence, and to that effect he invented an Extravagant Explication of thoſe words, This is my Body, ſaying, that by the word, <hi>This,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97749:106"/>
did not mean that which he held in his hand, but that he pointed to his own true Body.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. It is not True that <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> was the firſt that oppoſed the Doctrine of the Real preſence. <hi>Bertram, Erigenes, Rabanus,</hi> oppoſed it in the ninth Century when <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> ſpread it abroad: <hi>Berengarius</hi> oppoſed it in the Eleventh, and in the Age of the Reformation it ſelf the <hi>Bohemians</hi> called <hi>Taborites,</hi> and thoſe of the Valleys of <hi>Piemont</hi> and <hi>Province,</hi> called <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> openly rejected it. So, that although all they have ſaid of <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſtadius</hi> were true, yet we have not any particular intereſt in him, and we ſhall ſay in reſpect of him, that which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid in reſpect of <hi>Caecilianus.</hi> Caecilianus <hi>is not my Father, for</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid, call no man Father upon Earth, for one is your Father even God, but I call</hi> Caecelianus <hi>my Brother, my good Brother, if he be a good man, but my bad Brother if he be not good.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I know not whether that pretended <hi>Anabaptiſm</hi> of <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> is not an ill-grounded Accuſation, into which <hi>Mc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf, who did not love <hi>Caroloſtadius,</hi> might have been ſurprized, as it frequently happens among perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in their Opinions, at leaſt it is certain that <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> defended himſelf by publick Writings, and that he proteſted that he was innocent. And as to that Explication that he gave of the word, <hi>This,</hi> in the words of Jeſus Chriſt, it is an Error from the Truth, and a falſe gloſs on the Signification of that Word, but it is an Error notwithſtanding that does not hinder, that the ground of his ſentiment concerning the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> ſhould not be true and right, and how many different interpretations are there of the ſame word, upon which they refute one another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and who almoſt all ſay things very remote from common ſence?</p>
               <p>2. Object. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> had already began his Reformation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prejug.</hi> Chap. 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 238.</note> ever he ſpoke a word of the Real Preſence, and Adoration of the Hoſt, although he notes in his Works that from that very Time he was perſwaded in his heart that Jeſus Chriſt was not really preſent in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> But as it is very hard to believe that during all that Time he never ſaid Maſs, that he never aſſiſted at it, and that he never adminiſtred the Sacrament, that he ſhould not all the while be diſcovered by thoſe who adored it, and that he ſhould never have done the ſame Actions that were practiſed by others, they may very well underſtand what Judgment their Miniſters uſed in their Conduct during thoſe firſt Years. For
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97749:107"/>
according to all their Principles they ought to have Condemned it, ſince it was as little allowable to <hi>Zuinglius</hi> to partake with that Worſhip, as it is at preſent to the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and ſince they pretend that it is ſo far forbidden them, that they urge the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation that they ſay lies upon them not to take any part in it, as the chief Reaſon of their Separation. So that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining yet in Communion with thoſe who adored the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> contributed to that adoration by his Miniſtry and joyning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to their Aſſemblies, rendred himſelf guilty of all thoſe ſins which the <hi>Calvinists</hi> apprehend to be committed in remaining united to the Church. He would every day have betrayed his Conſcience, he would every day have committed a criminal Idolatry. And it is in that condition, that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that God made uſe of him for the greateſt Work that ever was done, which was the Reformation of the Error of all their Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> As that Accuſation is founded upon this only thing, That it is very hard to be believed, ſo alſo we ſhall here Anſwer in ſaying, That it is very hard to be believed, That <hi>Zuinglius</hi> did any thing during that Time that ſhould be repugnant to the Dictates of his Conſcience. All the Hiſtories of his Life ſhew that he was a man of ſtrict Piety, and of a ſevere Virtue, that he was not uſed to thoſe Juggles of the Hypocrite, which we may ſee practiſed by ſo many, and even by thoſe who would appear the moſt ſevere, and that moreover he never did any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the ſincerity of an honeſt man. They cannot then without equally violating the Laws of Juſtice and thoſe of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſuſpect on thoſe meer Conjectures, that he went contrary to his ſentiments on that Occaſion, and the Author of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices ought to produce the proofs of his Accuſation, or to ſuffer himſelf to be condemned for Injuſtice and Malignity. It is true that during that Time <hi>Zuinglius</hi> neither quitted his Miniſtry nor forſook thoſe who adored the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> but who has told the Author of the Prejudices, that men ought to forſake a People that are in Error, in the ſame Time that they have hopes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſing them, and labour to reduce them into the right way? As the Reformation of a Church is not the work of a Day, none can think it ſtrange that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> did not propoſe all of a ſudden all that he had to ſay, and that he did one thing after another. It is ſufficient, that during the Time wherein he ſet himſelf to that Work, he did not in the leaſt partake in the abuſes which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97749:107"/>
he had a deſign to correct, and therefore the Author of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices ought not to have accuſed him without ever laying down the proofs of his Accuſation. The Hiſtory of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> relates that he was called to the <note n="†" place="margin">Chair.</note> Church of <hi>Zurich</hi> in the beginning of the Year 1519. and that from the firſt moment wherein he was there, he ſet himſelf with all his might to the Inſtruction of his Flock, to the Reformation of thoſe groſſer Errors where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Miniſtry was then infected, and to the correcting of mens manners, which ſucceeded ſo well with him by the bleſſing of God, that within leſs then four years he changed the Face of that Church, and diſpoſed it to a thorough Reformation. But among thoſe Errors that he oppoſed, he applied himſelf particularly to the Sacrifice of the Maſs, ſhewing the People out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that there could be no other real Sacrifice, then that upon the Croſs, whence it is very eaſy to conjecture that he carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſſiſt in a Ceremony that he ſo openly oppoſed, and from which he himſelf withdrew his Hearers.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Object. Zuinglius</hi> engaged the Magiſtrates of <hi>Zurich</hi> to call a <hi>Synod,</hi> and to make themſelves Judges and Arbiters for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoſpin. Hiſt. Sacr. Part. Alt.</hi> Fol. 22.</note> the State of the Religion of their Canton. There was never till then a <hi>Synod</hi> of that Nature ſpoke of, and it is an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing thing, that mens raſhneſs and inſolence ſhould have been able to have carried them out to ſo great an exceſs. The Council of two hundred, that is to ſay, Two hundred Burghers of a <hi>Switz</hi> Town, as learned and ready in matters of Divinity, as one may believe the <hi>Switz</hi> Burghers were, called together all the Church-men under their juriſdiction, to diſpute before them, with an Intention to Order the State of Religion with the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It were much to be wiſhed that the diſcourſe of the Author of the Prejudices were as well Ordered as that Action of the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Zurich</hi> was; beſides theſe Abuſes and Superſtitions that were Ordinary, they had ſeen for ſome Time paſt a Preacher of Indulgences in that Church called <hi>Samſon,</hi> ſent by the <hi>Pope</hi> to diſtribute his Pardons. That Preacher managed his part ſo well, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoſpin. Hiſt. Sacra, Part. Alt.</hi> Fol. 22.</note> that there were not any Crimes how great ſoever they were, that were or ſhould be committed which he did not ſet a price upon, without making any other difficulty then about the Sum that was be paid to him; and by that means he put the whole Country into a dreadful diſorder, filling it with profligate Perſons. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> oppoſed this Seducer with all his might, and at the ſame time
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97749:108"/>
he laboured to give his Flock the knowledge of the true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Chriſtian Religion, and to reduce them back to one only Jeſus Chriſt, and his Scripture, in freeing them from the Errors and Superſtitions of Mens Invention. But as the Word of God was never yet without Adverſaries, the greater number of the Church-men lifted themſelves up againſt <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and accuſed him before the people to be a Heretick, which forced the Senate it ſelf to take knowledge of thoſe Accuſations, and to call together a <hi>Synod</hi> compoſed of all the Church-men of its State, wherein every one had the liberty to propoſe what he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> that of defending himſelf. And that very thing was done by the conſent of the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> who ſent his Deputies thither, and among others <hi>John le Fevre</hi> his Vicar General. What was there in all that that might not come from the Juſtice and Prudence of a <hi>Senate?</hi> If the Accuſations wherewith they charged <hi>Zuinglius</hi> had been well grounded, it had been the Duty of the Magiſtrate to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him Silence; and being falſe as they were, it was the Magiſtrates duty to uphold him. What is it that the Author of the Prejudices can blame in that Conduct? <hi>They called a Synod.</hi> We maintain it to be the Right of Kings and Soveraign Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates within the extent of their States. The Holy Story Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that <hi>Joſias</hi> intending to ſet up the pure worſhip of God in his <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.</note> Kingdom, called together an Aſſembly of Prieſts, Prophets, and the Elders of the People. Can they deny that the Chriſtian Emperours did not heretofore call Councils to Order the State of Religion, and to provide againſt diſorders in the Church? Can they deny that our Kings have not often done the ſame in their Kingdome? <hi>But the Senate of</hi> Zurich <hi>would of it ſelf take Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the matters of Religion.</hi> I ſay that that very thing was its Right, for if it be the Duty of every Chriſtian, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his own Salvation, to take Cognizance of thoſe things that the Church-men Teach, and not blindly to refer themſelves to their Word, as I have made it appear to be in the firſt Part, it is not leſs the Duty of Magiſtrates to do the ſame, to bind the Church-men to acquit themſelves faithfully in their Charges, and to Teach men nothing that might not be conformable to the Word of God. So that if the Miniſters of the Church go aſtray from that Word, and if they corrupt their Miniſtry by Errors and Superſtitions, it belongs to the Magiſtrate to Labour to reduce them to their Duty, by the mildeſt and juſteſt methods he can uſe.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:97749:108"/>
Thus the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> uſed it heretofore as it appears from the Hiſtory of <hi>Hezechias, Joſias,</hi> and of ſome others who made uſe of that lawful Authority that God gave them for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of their Church by the Word of God. We all know that the Antient Emperors took Cognizance either by themſelves of their Commiſſioners of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, and not only of thoſe that reſpected the Diſcipline, but of thoſe alſo which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Doctrine and the very Eſſence of Religion it ſelf, to that degree, that they frequently publiſhed under their Names in the Form of Edicts, Deciſions of Opinions, Condemnations of Hereſy, and the Interpretations of the Faith, which they had cauſed to be diſputed in their Preſence in <hi>Synodal</hi> Aſſemblies. We ought not therefore to imagine, that Magiſtrates ought not to interpoſe in matters of the Faith, under a pretence that they are Lay-men, for on the contrary they ought to interpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more in thoſe, then in thoſe of Diſcipline, becauſe the Faith reſpects every man, where Diſcipline relates to the Clergy more peculiarly. Therefore it was that <hi>Pope Nicholas</hi> the Firſt told the Emperour <hi>Michael,</hi> who was preſent in perſon in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil where only the Fact of <hi>Ignatius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was treated of, whom that Emperour had depoſed, <hi>That he did not find that the Emperours his Predeceſſours had been preſent at Synodal Aſſemblies, unleſs they might poſſibly have been in thoſe where matters of the Faith were Treated of, which is a common Thing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating Generally to all, and which belongs not only to the Clergy, but the Laity alſo, and univerſally to all Chriſtians.</hi> There was nothing therefore in that Action of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Zurich</hi> that was not a Right common to all Soveraign Magiſtrates within the extent of their Juriſdictions.</p>
               <p>But they will ſay, Was it not to break off the Unity of their Church, with the reſt to go about ſo to order the State of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion within their Canton, without the Participation of other Churches, and were they not Schiſmaticks in that very thing? I anſwer, That when a Prince or a Soveraign Magiſtrate is in a condition to call a General Council together to deliberate about the Common Faith, he would do better to take that way. But when he is not, as the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Zurich</hi> evidently was not, ought he to abandon all care of the Churches of his State? They will ſee in the end of this Treatiſe, that the States of <hi>Germany</hi> ſeeing the Oppoſitions that the <hi>Popes</hi> made to the calling of a general Council, often demanded a National one of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi>

the Fifth. They will ſee alſo that that Emperour was ſometimes reſolved to do it, and that he Threatned the <hi>Popes</hi> to cauſe divers Colloquies or Conferences of Learned men to be held, to labour to decide thoſe Articles that were Controverted. They will ſee that our Kings for the ſame deſign, have ſometimes delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated about aſſembling a National Council in <hi>France:</hi> And no body is ignorant of the Conference of <hi>Poiſſy</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth. There was nothing therefore in the Conduct of that buſineſs that did not belong to the Right of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns, and nothing which they can charge with Schiſm in it. For when a Prince or a Senate Aſſembles a <hi>Synod,</hi> to condemn Hereſies or Reform Errors, and by that means takes Cognizance of matters of Religion, provided that in effect, that which it condemns be a Hereſy, or that which it Reforms be an Error; he is ſo far from breaking Chriſtian Unity, that on the contrary he confirms it, as much as he can, in freeing it from a falſe and wicked Unity, which is, that of Error, which cannot be other then deſtructive to the whole Body of the Church, and which cannot be too ſoon broken. So that we ought to Judge of their Action, more by the Foundation, then the Form or Manner. For the Foundation being good, its Action cannot but be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. When a Man is Sick, with divers others, as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens in Epidemical Diſeaſes, it would be Injuſtice in him, not to provide for his own particular healing, but to ſtay for a general one; and it would be a great abſurdity to ſay that if he did do ſo, he violated the Rights of the Civil Society, for the Civil Society does not conſiſt in being a Communion of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but in being a Communion of Life. On the contrary it ought to be ſaid that in healing himſelf in particular, he eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed as much as in him lay that Civil Society which he had with his diſeaſed Companions, becauſe he encouraged them by his Example to heal themſelves with him, the better to enjoy in common the advantages of Life. It is the ſame caſe here, where a Church ſees it ſelf infected with Error and Superſtition with divers other Churches, ſhe no ways violates Chriſtian Unity in labouring to reform her ſelf particularly, for the Chriſtian Unity does not conſiſt in the Communion of Errors and Abuſes, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Communion of that True Faith and Piety. It eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes therefore on the contrary that Unity, becauſe it gives others a good Example, and thereby encourages them to reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it has done. All that which a Prince or Soveraign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:97749:110"/>
ought to obſerve in thoſe Seaſons, is, on one ſide to take heed that he makes a juſt diſcerning of good and evil, I would ſay, that he reforms nothing, which would not be in effect an Error, or a Superſtition, or an Abuſe, and that he does not give any wound to the True Religion under a pretence of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and on the other ſide, to offer no violence to Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, but to purify the Publick Miniſtry as much as he can, by the general conſent of the People that God has committed to him. But this is that, which not only the Magiſtrates of <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich,</hi> but thoſe alſo of other places who laboured in the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Churches religiouſly Obſerved. They conſtrained no perſon, and they rejected nothing that was not Alien to the Chriſtian Religion.</p>

The true knowledge of Chriſtians does not conſiſt in having a head full of Scholaſtick Speculations, and a Memory loaded with a great many Hiſtories, and multitudes of paſſages of divers Authors, or a great many Critical Notions, nor in having well-ſtudied <hi>Lombard, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Scotus, Bonaventure, Capreolus, Aegidius Romanus, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham, Gabriel Biel,</hi> the Canon Law, the Decretals; and all thoſe other great Names wherewith they ſtunned the People in times paſt. Our True knowledge is the Holy Scripture, Read with Humility, Charity, Faith and Piety. See here all that thoſe poor Burghers of <hi>Zurich</hi> knew, they were neither Prelats, nor Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, nor Doctors of <hi>Lovain,</hi> nor of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> but they were good men, they feared God, they ſtudied his Word, and for the reſt of the State of their underſtandings, and the degree of their

light, may appear by the Reformation which they made, for the Tree may be known by its Fruits.</p>
               <p>4. Objection, <hi>The matter which was to have been handled in that pretended Synod cannot be more conſiderable. For they Treated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in about aboliſhing all at once the Authority of all the Councils that were held in the Church ſince the Apoſtles days, under a pretence of reducing all to the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Since the True Authority of the Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils conſiſts in their Conformity with the Divine writings, the way ſolidly to eſtabliſh them is to reduce all to the Scripture, as they did in that Synod. If the Author of the Prejudices pretends to give the Fathers and Councils and Authority quite different, from that of the Word of God, whereof they ought to be the Miniſters and Interpreters, we may anſwer him, that he affronts them under a pretence of Honouring them. For as it is the greateſt real injury that can be done to a Subject, to give him the Authority of his Prince; So it is the moſt real injury which they can do to the Fathers, to inveſt them with the Authority of God.</p>
               <p>5. Objection, <hi>They medled with the Faith of all the other Chriſtian Churches, which the</hi> Switzers <hi>could not but condemn in embracing a new Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The <hi>Swiſſes</hi> did not embrace a new Faith, but they renounced thoſe Errors, that it may be might have prevailed for ſome Ages, but which were new in regard of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They did not condemn other Churches in that which they had of good, but they condemned that evil which they had in them. A ſick perſon who has cured himſelf condemns the diſeaſes of others, but he condemns not that Life which remains in them. On the contrary he exhorts them to be healed, for fear leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in that ſick condition they ſhould die.</p>
               <p>6. Object. <hi>They treated about all thoſe dangerous Conſequences, which that Change of Religion would have produced, and which were eaſy to have been foreſeen.</hi>

All theſe Objections are well near the ſame that the Pagans made againſt the Primitive Chriſtians, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:97749:111"/>
it ſeems that the Author of the Prejudices has ſtudied them out of <hi>Celſus, Prophyrie,</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> to make uſe of them againſt us.</p>
               <p>7. Object. <hi>Moreover they declared that they would have men make uſe of the Authority of the Scripture only, and by that raſh</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scripture is the only Rule of the Faith of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and there is no other but that alone whoſe Authority we ought to admit as Soveraign and deciſive of Controverſies. It is not True that all the foregoing Councils admitted of the Opinions of the Fathers and their Traditions under that Quality. The Author of the Prejudice lays it down, without Proof and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>8. Object. <hi>The Church being in poſſeſſion of its Doctrine, they</hi>

                  <hi>ought to have forced</hi> Zuinglius <hi>to produce his Accuſations againſt that Doctrine, and to have made the proofs which he alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it to have been examined. But in ſtead of that they ordered that he ſhould appear in that Diſputation in Quality of Defender, and that it ſhould be the others part to convince him if Error.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have the World believe the Doctrine that ſhe Teacheth, it is fit ſhe ſhould furniſh it with proofs, and her pretended poſſeſſion cannot aſſure it. Thoſe who propound any thing as matter of Faith are naturally bound to prove it, and it is abſurd to ſay that Poſſeſſion diſcharges that Obligation, for the Faith ought to be always founded upon proof, and it never ſtands upon meer poſſeſſion, otherwiſe the Heathens ought to have kept their Religion which was eſtabliſhed on ſo An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient a Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>9. Object. <hi>All that Examination was further grounded upon this ridiculous Principle, That if there could not be found any perſon within the Territory of</hi> Zurich <hi>that could make the Errors of</hi> Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius <hi>appear by the Scripture, it ought to be concluded that he had none. As if the weakneſs of thoſe who oppoſed his Doctrine could not be an effect of their Ignorance, rather then a default in the cauſe they defended.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection is no more to the purpoſe then the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going. What could the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Zurich</hi> have done more then to have aſſembled all the Clergy of their States to have called the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtance</hi> or his Deputies thither, to have received
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97749:112"/>
all the World, and given all liberty of propounding their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Proofs? It belonged to them to propound them if they had any and if they had none, they ought to have acknowledged that 'till then they had abuſed the Conduct of the people, in Teaching them thoſe things which they had no proofs for. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I ſee well that the Author of the Prejudices tells us how he underſtands we ſhould be bound to believe things upon this frivolous Foundation, that there may be ſome in the World able to prove them, or that it may be there might be ſome to come hereafter to do it. This is the Faith which he wiſhes that the Magiſtrates and People of <hi>Zurich</hi> would have had for the hindring their Reformation. He would have had them imagined that although they ſhould have ſeen nothing that ſhould have perſwaded the Worſhipping of Images, and that of Reliques, the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and the other points that were in Controverſy, yet that they ought not to have ceaſed from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them with a Divine Faith, and to have devoutly practiſed them, becauſe there might have been poſſibly ſome men in the World ready enough to prove them, or that if there were none then there might have ſome aroſe afterwards to have done it. By this Principle the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> may yet at this day accuſe all the Converſions of the firſt Chriſtians of Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>10. Object. <hi>The Calviniſts cannot deny that their pretended Reformation, was not eſtabliſhed on the Spirit of Error, and that the</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When the Author of the Prejudices will take the pains to conſider well the ſence of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and ours, he will find a perfect agreement. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> denied the Interceſſion of the Saints, we do no leſs in the ſence wherein they underſtand the word <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to wit, that the Saints intercede for us as True Mediators. We deny not that the Saints pray in general for the Church a Prayer of Charity and Communion; <hi>Zuinglius</hi> denied it no more then we. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> denied that it was allowable to make Images for the uſe of Religion; we deny it with him. We believe that it is indifferent to make them for
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97749:112"/>
a Civil uſe; <hi>Zuinglius</hi> never ſaid the contrary. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> ſaid that the True way not to err was to cleave wholly to the Word of God, we ſay ſo alſo. He ſaid that Jeſus Chriſt alone was given us for the Pattern of our Life, and not the Saints; But he meant it of a firſt and perfect Pattern, and ſo he explained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when he added theſe words, <hi>Capitis enim eſt nos deducere non Membrorum:</hi> It belongs to the Head to guide us, and not to the Members. There is nothing in that contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <hi>the art to pick out certain vulgar Reaſonings, and very well ſitted to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of the</hi> Switzers, <hi>he declaimed fiercely againſt the</hi> Popes, <hi>who had forbidden the Prieſts Marriage, he highly exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated the Rigidneſs of the Command of the Church which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Abſtinence from Meats, which he Attributed to the</hi> Popes <hi>only.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe Vulgar Reaſonings were nevertheleſs very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Reaſons, for they made them ſee that the Prelates had Uſurped a Tyrannical Domination over their Conſciences and that they Exerciſed it after the moſt Scandalous manner in the World, enjoyning a <hi>Caelibacy</hi> that filled the Church with beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſes and impurities, and forbidding the uſe of Meats on certain days, which they abſtained not from themſelves. For the reſt, thoſe injurious Diſcourſes againſt a whole Nation which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a great deal of Vertue and Glory, are not methinks within the Rules of Chriſtian Charity, nor even within thoſe of Civil Honeſty. If the <hi>Switzers</hi> have not naturally as florid a wit as ſome other Nations have, they have a Solid, Right, Judicious, Laborious, Conſtant, Faithful, Sincere mind, which are Qualities far more eſtimable then thoſe which uſually accompany that which they call the Heat of Imagination.</p>
               <p>12. Object. <hi>Zuinglius anſwered to a Reaſon of the Chancell ur of</hi> Zurich, <hi>after a very Falſe and Sophiſtical manner at the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

                  <hi>but proper enough to confound the underſtandings of the</hi> Switzers. <hi>He accuſed the Chancellour of Ignorance in that he took, he ſaid, theſe words, The field us the World, for a Parable, whereas they were only an Explication of the Parable, and not the Parable it ſelf. But the Chancellour would have ſaid no more but this, That theſe Words, The ſeed is the Word of God, could not be taken according to the Letter, ſince they were the Explication of a Parable to which they had Reference, therefore</hi> Zuinglius <hi>took great heed how he anſwered,</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:97749:113"/>
                  <hi>and he was forced to ſave himſelf by a trick in giving the words a change. For there is no body who ſees not that what the Chancellour ſaid was indiſputable; and that thoſe words, The ſeed is the word of God, being the Explication of a Parable, could not be taken in the Letter, but that it is as if Jeſus Chriſt had ſaid, When I ſpake of the ſeed in this Parable, I mean by that the Word of God. But theſe words, This is my Body, being no Explication of any Parable, and not being accompanied with any circumſtances that ſhould oblige us not to take them according to the Letter, there is nothing more ridicul us then to compare them with the Expreſſions that explain Parables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is no great ſubtilty from a man who talks of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a groſs and <hi>Suitz</hi> underſtanding. As we ought not to take litterally thoſe words which explain a Parable, ſo we ought not to take litterally thoſe words which explain a Sacrament. For in this reſpect a Sacrament is as a Viſible Parable, ſince it is a Viſible ſign, that repreſents an inviſible Grace. The Reaſon for which we ought not litterally to take thoſe words that explain a parable, is becauſe we ſee the matter Treated of there, is one thing that repreſents another, and which by conſequence cannot be that other thing Subſtantially and Really. And the whole Reaſon for which we ought not to take literally the words that explain a Sacrament is, becauſe we ſee the matter Treated of there is one thing which ſignifies another, and which by conſequence cannot be that thing Subſtantially and Really. So that theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and thoſe, <hi>The ſeed is the Word of God,</hi> are alike, and if we ought not to take the latter litterally becauſe they are the Explication of a Parable, we ought not alſo to take the others litterally becauſe they are the Explication of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principal Objections of the Tenth Chapter of the Book of Prejudices, excepting one which is taken from the manner wherein they formed our firſt Aſſemblies at <hi>Paris,</hi> at the beginning of the Reformation, and the Election that they made there of a Layman to the calling of the Miniſtry, for the Solution whereof I remit you to the Fourth Part, where it ſhall meet with its fit place.

                     </gap>e how to take out the mote that is in thy Brothers Eye.</hi> But I ſhall ſay, that when they find in the Writings of the firſt Reformers Expreſſions that plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear to be too vehement, whether in reſpect of things or perſons, equity would require it of them, that before they Judge, they ſhould conſider, whether they had not ſome particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that obliged them to ſpeak after that manner. But although we acknowledge that our firſt Reformers were not wholly free from faults, and that we no ways pretend to Canonize all their Words, nor all their Actions, yet if they take heed to the Circumſtances of the Times wherein they wrote, they will ſee that they ought to Judge of them far otherwiſe then the Author of the Prejudices has done, and that it is neither through malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor hatred, that they ſpoke with ſo much vehemence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that they were urged to it by Reaſons which they Judged moſt Weighty. Firſt of all, they thought that there was ſome neceſſity of uſing ſuch a Stile, to awaken men out of that profound ſleep wherein they appeared to have been for a long time, and to put all of them into that juſt fear which they ought to have of God's Judgments, when they were plunged into Errors like to thoſe, wherein they pretended the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then was. And it is moſt true, that until their days, the World had lain under a great Inſenſibility. Not, that they did not know the evil, that they did not bewail it, that they did not thirſt after a remedy, and that they did not readily
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:97749:114"/>
hear all who would proclaim it; but after all, they remained all along in the ſame State, or to ſay better, they grew worſe and worſe every day. Upon that account it was, that our firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers thought that they ought to repreſent things livelily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extenuating words, to make the greater impreſſion upon thoſe minds that ſecurity or fearfulneſs had held bound in ſleep. 2. They were obliged to all that, by the Protection that Errors and Abuſes found in their days, among the greater part of the Prelats, and the Monks of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had Orders from <hi>Rome,</hi> as I have proved elſewhere, to lift themſelves up in all places for the defence of that which they called the Antient Religion, and who accuſed the Reformers of Hereſy and Impiety. For then it was neceſſary, to make uſe of all the force of Expreſſions that they had, to diſſipate thoſe accuſations, and to diſcover to the World the groſneſs of the Abuſes which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. 3. They ſaw themſelves further conſtrained to it, by the ſeverity which they had to wipe of, on the part of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, for, as they were perſwaded of the Juſtice of their Cauſe, the moſt natural effect of the Perſecutions which they were to endure was to open their eyes more, and the more to urge their underſtanding to acknowledge that Juſtice, and to make all the World acknowledge it, not only to comfort themſelves and to encourage themſelves in their afflictions, but alſo to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their Brethren whom they ſaw every where in the Fetters of the Inquiſitions. Being then provoked to it by theſe Three Reaſons, the one taken from the ſtupidity wherein they ſaw the greateſt part of men, the other from the obſtinate defence that was made of Errors and Abuſes, and the Third from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions which they had to endure; it muſt not be reckoned ſuch a wonder that they ſpoke with vehemence upon the Subject of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. It had been ill done to have done ſo otherwiſe. 4. They themſelves ought to acknowledge that the greater part of thoſe Abuſes were of ſuch a nature, that it had been a very hard matter not to have ſpoke of them without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. As for example, that vain Devotion that they had kindled in the minds of the People for Images, Reliques, for <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> for Pilgrimages; that credulity which they had inſtilled into them for all ſorts of Miracles, for Apparitions of Saints, for the returns of Souls out of Purgatory, and I know not how many other things which our more inlightned. Age has ſome kind of ſhame of, but which yet made up the greateſt part then
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:97749:114"/>
of Religion with reſpect to practiſe. How could they coldly Treat of the Abuſe of Indulgences, which had gone ſo far as not only to give pardon of ſins for Money by means of Confeſſion and Contrition, but even to pardon them in expreſs words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either, as <hi>Pope Bonif<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

I acknowledge alſo, that when they looked upon that Great Body of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, its Props, its Pretenſions, its Maxims, its Intereſts, its Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they could not hinder themſelves from ſpeaking of it as an Empire very oppoſite to that of Jeſus Chriſt, but they ought to be ſo far from laying it to their charge, that they ſaid it out of a hatred or an implacable averſion toward the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Author of the Prejudices does, that they ought on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to attribute it to a real compaſſion which they had for the People of God, to ſee them ſo ill inſtructed, ſo ill guided, ſo ill governed, and to an ardent deſire to procure a good Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion throughout the whole Body of the Latin Church. And the greater their compaſſion was, the more difficult it was to manage that matter without giving ſome touches to perſons in whom the ſource of all that evil reſided, and eſpecially in a Time which they ſaw overſpread on all ſides with injuries and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, and expoſed in diverſe places to Rigorous Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

Examples of this may be ſeen in every</hi> Page <hi>of the Books of their Miniſters, as when they reproach the Catholicks with ſetting up as Articles of Faith, the Corruption of the</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Hebrew <hi>Text, the immunity of the Clergy to be of Divine Right, the certainty of the Declarations that the</hi> Popes <hi>make of the Holineſs of particular men which they call Canonization, the efficacy of</hi> Agnus Dei's, <hi>the Infallibility of the</hi> Pope, <hi>his Temporal Power over Kings, his Pre-eminence over Councils, the Juriſdiction of the Church over the Souls in Purgatory, and many other opinions</hi>

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I ſhall not omit to ſay by the way ſomething of my own head upon each of thoſe Articles.

As for the Immunity of the Clergy, it may be alſo that ſome Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have been reproached for holding it as a matter of Faith, becauſe there are ſome among them that in effect ground it upon the Scripture, and every one knows that all that which they hold as out of the Scripture, ought to be held as a matter of Faith.

                  <hi>that gave the Laity any power over the perſons of the Clergy;</hi> which implies that the Clergy are excepted by Divine right from that general Rule that ſubjects all the Word to the Higher Powers: We all know that our Kings oppoſed that raſh deciſion, but in the end it was a Council that did it which had the <hi>Pope</hi> for its Head, and it belongs to the Author of the Prejudices to tell us whether he believes that that <hi>Pope</hi> and that Council erred. As to the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Canonizations, ſince there is no body in the Church of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:97749:116"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> that makes any ſcruple to invocate thoſe Saints which the <hi>Pope</hi> Canonizes, and that moreover they agree in that Maxim of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that whatſoever in the matter of Religion is not of Faith is Sin, methinks it is not ill grounded to ſay either that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Sins, when ſhe invocates thoſe Canonized Saints without any certainty of Faith, or that ſhe holds it as a matter of Divine Faith that the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot be deceived. The Author of the Prejudices ſhall chuſe which ſide he pleaſes, if he takes the laſt, he contradicts himſelf; if he takes the former, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> condemns him; for he condemns all thoſe who throw away the Acts of their Religion after that manner at all Adventure. If the Efficacy of <hi>Agnus Dei's</hi> has not been eſtabliſhed by the Councils, that belief may be found at leaſt heretofore ſo ſtrongly and univerſally eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it may be very well aſcribed to her without any fear of miſtaking. They tell us that <hi>Pope <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> V. ſent to <hi>John Palcologus</hi> the Emperour of the <hi>Greeks</hi> an <hi>Agnus</hi> folded up in fine Paper, wherein there was written Fine Verſes which explained all its properties.

They cannot alſo deny as to Practice that there are not divers Examples to be found of <hi>Popes</hi> who undertook effectually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Emperours and Kings, and to give away their Kingdomes to others. In fine, as to that which regards their Juriſdiction over Souls in Purgatory, no Body is ignorant that the <hi>Popes</hi> pretended to have Power to draw Souls out of Purgatory, at leaſt through the diſpenſation of the Treaſure of the Church, which is that, which they ſay is made up of the Super-abundant Satisfactions of Jeſus Chriſt and the Saints. It is upon that alſo that their Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences in reſpect of the Dead are Founded, and <hi>Leo</hi> in his <hi>Bull</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bulla Leon. ubi ſupra.</note> of Excommunication againſt <hi>Luther</hi> had wrote, <hi>That Indulgences were neither neceſſary nor uſeful to the Dead.</hi> Furthermore I cannot forbear taking notice here of the Fallacy that the Author of the Prejudices gives us, and which is common to him with a great many other perſons. He would have us Judge of that Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but only by that which ſhe has decided in her Councils, or by that which is contained in an Act of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſion of the Faith which ſhe makes thoſe make who embraue her Communion. This I ſay is a perfect Fallacy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe we ought alſo to Judge of her by her common Practice, which being open to the Eyes of all the World, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers much more clearly the true Sentiments of that Church, when the deciſions of the Councils do not, and the Act of which the people ſcarce know any.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Council of Trent it ſelf and the Act of the Profeſſion of the Faith, obliging as they do thoſe who ſubmit themſelves to it, to receive in general unwritten Traditions and thoſe things which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Obſerves, they engage them by conſequence to receive and practiſe all that which is commonly obſerved and practiſed in that Church, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Tradition and obſervance, although it ſhould not be formally contained either in the deciſions of Councils, or in that Profeſſion of Faith. So that the Conſcience of a man who is in that Communion, binds him to believe, and do all that others believe and do.</p>

                  <hi>in their Miniſters, nor leſs unjuſt in it ſelf. It conſiſts in running down as blameable Errors certain Articles of the belief of the Church, which not only were no Errors, but about which they have been at laſt conſtrained to acknowledge that the difference between them and the Church conſiſts more in words then in the thing it ſelf, whether they themſelves have forſook their firſt thoughts, to take up thoſe of the Catholicks, or whether by a blind raſhneſs they had openly condemned them without underſtanding them.</hi> To prove this Corruption, the Author of the Prejudices lays down the point of Juſtification, which, he ſays, the firſt Reformers took for the chief ground of their Separation, and yet nevertheleſs he adds one of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of <hi>Sedan</hi> named <hi>Ludovicus le Blanc,</hi> who has made ſome <hi>Theſes</hi> of Juſtification, after having examined the Doctrine of the Catholicks, and that of the Proteſtants and their principal differences about that matter, concludes upon all the Articles that that of the Catholicks is good, and that the Proteſtants are only contrary to them in name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I acknowledge that in this Controverſy the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> takes the word Juſtification in one ſence, and that we take it in another, and I do not deny but that has ſometimes produced in that diſpute, ambiguities and differences or Words. This is alſo that which M. <hi>le Blanc</hi> had a deſign to clear in his <hi>Theſes</hi> of Juſtification, which the Author of the Prejudices has abuſed. But beſides that in that very thing we have two advantages over the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the one, that we ſpeak as the Scripture has done, and that we take the words after the manner that Jeſus Chriſt, that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and Saint <hi>James</hi> have taken them, when they have Treated about this Doctrine, whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gives them another ſence, and the other, that in ſo taking the words in their true Signification that <hi>Idea</hi> that we give of Juſtification is diſtinct and clear, where that of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is embroiled and confuſed. Beſides that, I ſay, it is certain that we have but too real differences upon that point which no ways conſiſts in words, but in the very things themſelves, and which make very weighty Controverſies. To Manifeſt this Truth, we need but to caſt our Eyes upon the four chief Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that form the <hi>Idea</hi> of our Juſtification according as the Scripture has given it us. The Firſt is, That it is an Act of the Soveraign mercy of God that pardons our ſins, and which by Vertue of the Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, diſcharges us from
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:97749:118"/>
the puniſhment we have deſerved by them. The Second is, That God out of that ſame mercy in pardoning our ſins adopts us for his Children, and gives us a right to his Eternal Inheritance by the merit of Jeſus Chriſt his Son. The Third, That we apply to our ſelves the ſatisfaction and merit of Jeſus Chriſt by a lively Faith, accompanied with a ſincere Repentance, and a Holy Recourſe to the Divine Mercy, and that it is this Faith that puts us into the Communion of our Redeemer. And the Fourth, That God in pardoning and adopting us, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes this Condition upon us, that for the time to come we live Holily according to the Laws which he has given us, and that this very thing is a neceſſary Conſequence of that Communion which we have with Jeſus Chriſt, as well as of our Faith, our Repentance and our Recourſe to the Divine mercy. There is not any one of theſe parts of our Juſtification upon which we have nor very conſiderable differences with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For in the Firſt we differ,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning him who Pardons us; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have it, not only that it ſhould be God in the Quality of a Soveraign Judge, but men alſo, that is to ſay Prieſts and Biſhops in Quality of inferiour and Subordinate Judges, and that their Abſolution is a Judiciary Act, for ſo the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Trid. Seſſ.</hi> 14. Can. 9.</note> defined it to be. But we believe that there is none beſides God who can pardon our ſins under the Quality of a Soveraign Judge, and that the Pardon which we receive from the Mouth of his Miniſters, is a Miniſterial Pardon, which conſiſts in a Declaration that they make to us of Gods Pardon, as the Interpreters of his will revealed in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We differ about the extent of that Pardon; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have it, that God in pardoning the Sin retains the Puniſhment, that is to ſay, that he acquits us from eternal Puniſhment, but that reſerves to himſelf the inflicting of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puniſhments; and we on the contrary hold that he remits all ſorts of Temporal and Eternal puniſhments, and that the Afflictions which he ſends us are not the Puniſhments of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but the Corrections and Chaſtiſements of his Fatherly Diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From whence there ariſes a Third difference, which conſiſts in this, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes that thoſe Temporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments wherewith God viſits us, are true Satisfactions to his Juſtice for our ſins, which we deny.</p>
               <p n="4">

4. There ariſes from thence yet another difference concerning that, which they call thoſe penal works which every one impoſes upon himſelf, or which their Confeſſors impoſe on their Penitents, for they would that theſe ſhould be alſo ſatisfactions to the Juſtice of God, which we do not believe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have it, that thoſe ſatisfactory Puniſhments ſhould go beyond this Life, and it is partly upon this that they ground their Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which we reject.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is alſo upon that very thing that the Indulgences of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are grounded, which cannot be taken for meer Relaxations of Canonical Puniſhments, ſince they extend moſt frequently very far beyond the life of man, and ſometimes even unto five and twenty, and Thirty thouſand Years.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We may ſay alſo, that it is a difference which we have with them, by which we underſtand that firſt Act of the mercy of God that Pardons our ſins, which comes from the difference which we have with them, concerning the Opinion of the Neceſſity of Auricular Confeſſion, for that Opinion is partly founded upon this, that Abſolution of the Prieſts is a Judiciary Act, and that in that reſpect the Church has a true Tribunal before which the Faithful are bound to appear, and partly upon the Opinion, that the penances which the Prieſt enjoyns are true Satisfactions to the Divine Juſtice which they are bound to undergo.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Laſtly it is from the ſame ſource that the difference proceeds which we have with them concerning the Super-abundant ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of the Saints, of which they will have it that the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful may partake, and whereof in part they compoſe the Treaſure of the Church.</p>
               <p>Behold here Eight Controverſies included in the Explication of the firſt Act of our Juſtification. Upon the ſecond we differ about the Foundation upon which the right that God gives us to life eternal is eſtabliſhed; or if you will, about the proper and direct cauſe in conſideration of which God gives us that right, for we eſtablish it alone upon the merits of Jeſus Chriſt in Vertue of that Comunion which we have with him. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Eſtabliſhes it upon the merit of our works alſo, for ſhe would have it, that after God has given us his Grace by which we do good works, we truly inherit not only an increaſe of Grace but Eternal life, and even an increaſe of Glory, and ſhe Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizes thoſe who do not believe it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:97749:119"/>
2. We differ alſo about thoſe to whom God gives that right, for we believe that God gives it only to his Elect, in whom he preſerves it by his Grace, and by the gift of perſeverance; but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes that he gives it alſo to divers Reprobates whom his Grace abandons, and who finally Periſh in their Sins.</p>
               <p>Upon the Third Doctrine, we differ concerning the Nature and the Definition of Juſtifying Faith, for as for us, we look on it as an Act of the Soul that embraces or accepts the ſatisfaction and merit of Jeſus Chriſt, and which applies the promiſes of God's mercy made to us in the Goſpel, and we labour as much as we can to live according to that thought. But the Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church frame an <hi>Idea</hi> of that Faith of a very great coldneſs and negligence, for they content themſelves to ſay that it is a conſent that we yield in general to all the Truths revealed in the Word of God; and there are ſome that go ſo far as to ſay, that Faith fails not to Juſtify us, although it ſhould not have the leaſt regard to the particular mercy of God towards us, which is a thing that we cannot underſtand without horrour. For the reſt, when I ſhall ſay that the Doctrines of the Imputation of the merit of Jeſus Chriſt, and his ſatisfaction are known but to a very few in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as that alſo is, of the Application that we make of them to our ſelves by the internal Act of our Souls which receives them; when I ſhall ſay that theſe Truths ſo important and ſo neceſſary to the practiſe of Chriſtianity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are almoſt ſtifled, by that great Multitude of external Exerciſes with which they buſy the People, I ſhall ſay nothing in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the more ſincere perſons will not acknowledge, and of which, God grant they may be able hereafter to convince me of a falſhood in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>In fine, the laſt Doctrine that fully makes up the <hi>Idea</hi> of our Juſtification according to the Scripture, produces of it ſelf a conſiderable Controverſy between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us. For as for us, we limit our ſelves to the good works to which our Juſtification Obliges us, and which God has enjoyned us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going any further. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> extends them even to thoſe which ſhe her ſelf Commands, for the pretends that her Laws properly and directly bind the Conſcience under pain of mortal Sin; and therefore it was that <hi>Leo</hi> X. condemned <hi>Luther</hi> for having wrote that the Church had no power to make
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:97749:119"/>
Laws concerning manners or good works. All theſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies that naturally ariſe from the different Explications which they give of the Tenet of Juſtification, let us ſufficiently ſee that the Author of the Prejudices is miſtaken, if he thinks that we ſhould have no more upon this matter then differences about words, and <hi>M. le Blanc</hi> is too ſincere and too Learned to have pretended to deny any of thoſe things which I have mentioned, although he has Judiciouſly remarked, that men may eaſily Equivocate upon the different Significations of the Terms.</p>
               <p>It is therefore neither a piece of Raſhneſs, nor Impertinency, that our firſt Reformers had ſuch a regard to the matter of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as being a thing of the greateſt importance in Religion, and it is on the contrary moſt Juſt, that having ſeen that Doctrine of the Salvation of Chriſtians, neglected, obſcured, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, that they ſhould have Judged it neceſſary to ſet themſelves upon the re-eſtabliſhing of it.</p>

               <p>TO underſtand well what is in the Twelfth Chapter of the Author of the Prejudices, we muſt in the firſt place take notice of the deſign he propounds to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the means he makes uſe of to reach it. As to his deſign, he Explains himſelf in the very Title of the Chapter, which bears this, <hi>That the Spirit of a Politician, every way Humane, that appears in the differences that the Calviniſts</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>have had with the Lutherans, gives a right to reject them, without any further Examination, as a ſort of men without any Conſcience.</hi> He explains himſelf yet further in the beginning of his diſcourſe after this manner. <hi>It has been demanded,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of the Calviniſts with good reaſon, how it could come to paſs, that if</hi> Luther, Zuinglius <hi>and</hi> Calvin, <hi>had received a Miſſion from God, and were the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he made choice of for the greateſt work that ever was, which is the Reformation of the Errors of ſixteen Centuries, they ſhould not avoid being openly divided between themſelves, to diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber themſelves from one another, to perſecute one another, after ſo outragious a manner, and to Treat one another, as the declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God and his Church.</hi> He explains himſelf alſo in another place, where he ſpeaks after this manner. <hi>The Innocence or the Crimes of</hi> Luther <hi>equally condemn the Calviniſts, either for having declaimed againſt an innocent perſon, or for having given unjuſt praiſes to one of the moſt wicked men that ever was, and that monſtrous conjunction which they have made in his perſon, of holineſs, with the moſt deteſtable Crimes, is an evident proof, that they have not the leaſt</hi> Idea <hi>of Chriſtian Vertue, nor of the Spirit of Chriſtianity.</hi> See yet further how he ſpeaks in the ſame Chapter, <hi>If</hi> Luther <hi>were an inſtrument of the Devil, a wicked perſon, a Schiſmatick, a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and paſſionate man, what will become of the Reformation that he has eſtabliſhed, and which ſerves as a Foundation to that of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists.</hi> In fine he explains himſelf in the 321 <hi>Page,</hi> where he ſays, <hi>That our behaviour in reſpect of the Lutherans is enough to give a ground to conclude that the Heads of the party of the</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:97749:120"/>
                  <hi>Calviniſts have been ſuch as have guided themſelves more by Policy then Conſcience; which being,</hi> adds he, <hi>moſt contrary to the Spirit of God, and remote from that which ought to be found in thoſe new Prophets which he would extraordinarily raiſe up, for the reforming of his Church, it is not poſſible for us to take them for men of that kind, and we have a moſt just ground to refuſe to hearken to them.</hi> It reſults from thence that the Author of the Prejudices had a deſign to conclude,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they ought to reject us without Examining any thing that we ſay, and without ſo much as hearing us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we are a ſort of men without any Conſcience, who have no <hi>Idea</hi> of Chriſtian Vertue, nor of the Spirit of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and who guide our ſelves by Worldly Policy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we overthrow the Reformation of <hi>Luther,</hi> which ſerves nevertheleſs for the Foundation of our own.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That our Firſt Reformers had none of their Miſſion from God, and that they were not the Inſtruments which he made choice of to Reform the Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> To eſtabliſh theſe propoſitions he heightens on one ſide the differences that were between <hi>Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and all that the heat of Diſputation made them ſay on one ſide and on the other, and in the end he ſets down the eſteem that we have always had of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> notwithſtanding thoſe Diviſions, and the Condeſcenſion that we have for him and thoſe of his Party, in opoſition to the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred that we have always,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Teſtified againſt the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>All that unjuſt Reaſoning is founded upon divers falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that the Author of the Prejudices has ſuppoſed as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and beyond all doubt, and of which notwithſtanding he has captiouſly ſuppreſſed one part, to give the more Colour to his Invective.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Reaſoning is founded upon 'this Propoſition, That we hold our Firſt Reformers to be new Prophets, or as he ſpeaks, to be the Apoſtles of a new Goſpel. But this is a falſe and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Suppoſition, for we hold on the contrary, that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers Preached nothing new, they were not under the Quality either of new Prophets, or Apoſtles of a new Goſpel; they did not boaſt that they brought a new Revelation into the World, but they only oppoſed humane Errors that had no Foundation in the old <hi>Revelation,</hi> and in that reſpect I have ſhewn that they had a more then ſufficient Call in the Right that is Common to all
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:97749:121"/>
Chriſtians and in the Miniſtry which they themſelves exerciſed in the Latin Church, without any neceſſity that there ſhould be any Extraordinary and immediate Miſſion of God for that, and I have explained in what ſence it muſt be underſtood that there was ſomething of Extraordinary in their Call.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Reaſoning ſuppoſes, That we ought not to hear any Reformers 'till firſt we have examined the Quality of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and if the Quality of their perſons do not ſatisfy us, we ought to reject their words, and to remain in the State we were in before. But there is nothing more pernitious then this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, to which I oppoſe a contrary Principle, which is, That we ought to judge of that which our Reformers ſaid by the word of God, and by the proper Characters of Truth or Falſhood which are in the things themſelves, after a manner abſtracted from the Judgment that we may make of thoſe perſons, and that it is a way to Error to Judge by the Qualities of the perſons. This is that which I have made appear elſewhere, and ſhall not omit to eſtabliſh it yet further in this place, for the greater clearing of this Truth. I ſay then that when it falls out that thoſe who Preach have perſonal Qualities that do not ſatisfy us, it is indeed a Reaſon that Obliges us to take the greater heed to their Doctrine. But thoſe matters being at the bottom, as they are, true or falſe in themſelves, without the perſons that propound them changing their natures, they ought to be chiefly conſidered in themſelves, if we would aſſure our ſelves in a good Conſcience that we are in the way of Truth; for we cannot have that aſſurance if we Judge only by the perſons, ſince the Faith is immediatly founded upon the word of God, and not upon that of men, whoſoever they be. Moreover, every one knows that a Judgment concerning perſons, is oftentime far harder and more ſubject to Error then that of the things themſelves, whether it be becauſe ordinarily it depends upon a great number of particular circumſtances, which one cannot exactly know, and which yet one ought to know before a man can be able to Judge, or whether it be alſo becauſe it is open to the Illuſions of Hypocriſy, which hides real vices under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Vertue, and to thoſe of Calumny, which turns the beſt actions into a bad meaning, that ſuppreſſes the good and heightens the bad. Beſides that it is certain that the Judgment which is made of perſons ought partly to depend on that of things, ſo far is it from that, that what is made of things ſhould depend on that of perſons. For on the one ſide how many Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:97749:121"/>
of Hereſy have there been whoſe life has appeared to have been very exemplary, and who were notwithſtanding ravenous Wolves? how many Phariſees who have boaſted of their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, while their Doctrine was a Leaven, whereof great heed was to be taken? There have been ſome who have even gone ſo far as to have wrought Miracles, and Jeſus Chriſt has foretold, <hi>that falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, who ſhall work great Signs and Wonders, capable of ſeducing the very Elect, if it were poſſible.</hi> And on the other ſide do not ſufficiently underſtand the ways of Divine Providence, to be able to conclude without raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it never makes uſe of perſons guilty of many crimes either for the Propagation of its Truth, or the Reformation of Errors. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>that God puts his Treaſure into Earthen</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Veſſels, that the Excellency of his power may be of God and not of man.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle Teaches us that divers in his Time <hi>Preached Jeſus Chriſt out of a Spirit of Envy and Contention.</hi> God heretofore made uſe of <hi>Salomon,</hi> not only for the building and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Temple, but alſo to give the Church one part of the Canon of its Scriptures, which is much more then the Temple, and yet notwithſtanding that Prince gave himſelf over to the love of Women, and fell into Idolatry; and laſtly, Jeſus Chriſt made uſe of a <hi>Judas</hi> at firſt, that ſold him into his Enemies Hands.</p>
               <p>But to decide this Queſtion by Examples drawn out of the Scripture, we find in the Hiſtory of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Jehis</hi> King of the Ten Tribes Reformed that Church, that he took away the Worſhip of the Falſe gods which <hi>Ahab</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, that he demoliſhed the Temple of <hi>Baal,</hi> and broke down his Images; ſee here without doubt a good Reformation. Notwithſtanding it is ſaid that he did not depart from the ſins of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> but that he retained the worſhipping of the Golden<hi>-Calves</hi> that were at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> It is alſo related that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht that Reformation in a very odious manner, and very unworthy of a Prince that made profeſſion of the fear of God. For having aſſembled all his People, he told them that he would ſerve <hi>Baal</hi> much more then <hi>Ahab</hi> had done, he commanded that all his Prophets and Prieſts ſhould meet together, and all the worſhippers of that falſe God to Celebrate a Solemn Feaſt for him. He himſelf pointed out the day of the Feaſt, and cauſed a Publication of it to be made. But when the Aſſembly was come into the Houſe of <hi>Baal,</hi> and all thoſe poor People who
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:97749:122"/>
truſted in his word, when they thought of nothing but their Devotions, he put them all to Death without letting any one eſcape. Suppoſe we, that we ought to Judge of a Reformation by the perſons that make it, what may not be ſaid againſt this here? <hi>Jehu</hi> made uſe of Hypocriſy and Treachery, he broke the publick Faith and his own, in the moſt Scandalous manner in the World, and the moſt contrary to the ſincerity of an honeſt man. Beſides that, he yet remained in the Superſtitions of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> and made the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> remain in them too. If we would believe the Author of the Prejudices, the Reformation that he made would be rather the work of the Devil, then that of the Spirit of God. <hi>Jehu</hi> would not have been Extraordinarily choſen by God to reform his Church and purge it from Idolatry. But this is not the Sentiment of the Scripture, it does not without doubt approve of the Treachery and Hypocriſy of <hi>Jehu,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the Golden <hi>Calves</hi> that he kept up, but it does not omit the praiſing of that Reformation in that good which it had, and to ſay that it was <hi>well pleaſing to God.</hi> And it is True that <hi>Jehu</hi> was extraordinarily called to that, as it appears by the Anointing that the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> gave him by one of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>We find in that ſame Scripture, the Hiſtory of divers other Reformations which were made in the Church of <hi>Judah,</hi> but we find alſo that they were almoſt wholly different among themſelves. Some went ſo far as the aboliſhing the uſage of the high places and the Groves, which were Heatheniſh Superſtitions, and the incenſe that was offered to the Serpent of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which was a kind of Idolatry; others yet retained all theſe things. Some even of thoſe who made theſe Reformations committed Actions very unpleaſing to God, which the Scripture Reflects on. It ſays of <hi>Aſa,</hi> who was one of thoſe Reformers, <hi>that being ſick of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>the diſeaſe whereof he died, he ſought not to God, but to the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 20.</note> It ſays of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> who was another, that he aided a wicked King, and that he <hi>loved thoſe whom God hated,</hi> becauſe he joyned himſelf with wicked <hi>Ahab.</hi> It ſays of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> who was yet <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 24.</note> another, that he fell in with the people into the Exerciſe of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and the uſe of the Groves, and that he cruelly killed a Prophet, becauſe he oppoſed thoſe Superſtitions. If you Judge of thoſe Reformations by their perſons, according to the Principle of the Author of the Prejudices, you muſt ſay not only that thoſe Reformers ought not to be heard, but that the Spirit of God
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97749:122"/>
was not there. For you ſee their Diſſentings, ſince ſome went further then the others, and that ſome condemn'd what the others retained; you ſee their perſonal Actions that you cannot excuſe, ſince the Scripture it ſelf condemns them. But if you Judge according to the Scripture, which is more worthy to be followed then the Author of the Prejudices, you will give to thoſe Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations the Praiſes which they merit in themſelves, you will approve of the more perfect ones, you will diſtinguiſh in the imperfect the good from the bad, without having reſpect to the Perſons; and when at laſt you would Judge of the Perſons, you would do it as Juſtice and Charity would Ordain you to do.</p>
               <p>If the Principle of the Author of the Prejudices were reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in regard of the Reformers of the Latin Church, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it would be ſo further in regard of the Propagators of the Chriſtian Religion and of its Ordinary Teachers. I would ſay, that if thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had reaſon not to hear the Reformers becauſe they had differences among themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſpoke injurious words of one another in the heat of their diſputes, becauſe they can take notice of ſome Vices in them, or a Conduct that may be ſuſpected to have had too much Worldly Policy, it follows from thence, by a far greater reaſon, that the Heathens ought not to have heard the Chriſtians as often as they ſhould have ſeen the ſame things to have appeared among them. But when was it that they might not have ſeen them appear? The Age of the Apoſtles, which we may juſtly call the Age of innocence, and of the peace of the Church, in compariſon of others, was that exempted from Diviſions and Vices? Thoſe who have read the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cannot be ignorant, that there were divers among the firſt Preachers of Chriſtianity, who would yet have retained <hi>Moſes</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt, and the Law with Grace, that there were divers who oppoſed themſelves to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> about divers points of his Doctrine, and who laboured to blaſt the honour of his Miniſtry, that there were ſome who in Preaching the Goſpel, diſcovered themſelves to be too much Tranſported with humane Paſſions, that there were even ſome who went ſo far as to deny the Doctrine of the Reſurrection. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> does not ſpare them, and the Juſt Complaints that he frequently makes of them, ſufficiently note that they had not on their parts all the reſpect for him which they ought to have had. Notwithſtanding whatſoever complaints he made of them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:97749:123"/>
vehement he was in his diſputes, yet we do not ſee that he Excommunicated them, nor that he delivered them over to Satan as he did the inceſtuous perſon of <hi>Corinth.</hi> He defends his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he calls them <hi>deceitful workers, Miniſters of Satan Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the Miniſters of Righteouſneſs,</hi> but he fails not yet in <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13, 15.</note> the ſame Chapter to give them the Title <hi>of Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt.

                  <hi>am more.</hi> Would the Author of the Prejudices have thought it well done if the Heathens of that Time had followed his Maxim, and if without ever Examining the Chriſtian Religion in it ſelf, they ſhould have preſently prejudged, upon the Diviſions which they beheld, and upon the Moderation that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> yet kept towards thoſe perſons, whom elſewhere he Treated roughly enough, that the Spirit of God did not accompany the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and that their Doctrine could not proceed from Heaven?</p>
               <p>Will they ſay that thoſe Infidels ought to have carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after that manner in the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> when the Biſhops that compoſed the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> appeared ſo eager, <note place="margin">

Thoſe who are well verſed in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, will yield that we might urge thoſe Examples a great deal further if we would but take the pains to do it, for there have been very few Ages wherein Chriſtians have not been divided between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that frequently upon grounds trivial enough, and wherein there may not have been found in their Conduct that very thing which the Author of the Prejudices believes to be incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with the Spirit of God, that is to ſay, the heats of Diſpute on the one ſide, and on the other ſome <note n="†" place="margin">Radourciſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens.</note>

I ſhall ſay nothing of the confuſions wherewith the <hi>Latin</hi> Church was agitated in thoſe Times, which <hi>Baronius</hi> calls unhappy, and wherein he ſays <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baron. ad Ann.</hi> 908.</note> the <hi>Popes</hi> made void the Acts of one another. <hi>Infeliciſſimo tempora cum alter alterius res gestas intruſus quiſque Pontifex aboleret.</hi> In effect, <hi>Formoſus</hi> having accepted of the <hi>Papacy</hi> againſt the Oath that <hi>John</hi> VIII. had made him take in depoſing him, that he would never think of being Biſhop, <hi>Stephen</hi> VII. his Succeſſour made him to be condemned in open Council, and all the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he had made, to be void; and having at laſt cauſed his Body to be taken out of his Grave, he made the three Fingers wherewith they give their bleſſing to be cut of and thrown into the River <hi>Tiber:</hi> but <hi>John</hi> IX. Succeſſour to <hi>Stephen,</hi> Aſſembled another Council at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> wherein he not only made all that <hi>Stephen</hi> and his Council had done againſt <hi>Formoſus</hi> to be void, but he even made all his Acts to be Canonically burned, re-eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the memory of <hi>Formoſus,</hi> and the Ordinances that he had made. Some Time after, <hi>Sergius</hi> a great Enemy of <hi>Formoſus,</hi> came to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and he annulled in his turn the Acts of the Council of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and made void all the Ordinances of <hi>Formoſus.</hi> Notwithſtanding the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> reckons all thoſe men among her <hi>Popes,</hi> and acknowledges them all to have been lawful ones: And which is further remarkable, <hi>John</hi> IX. in the ſame Act wherein he makes void the Council of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and wherein he condemns it to the Flames, he does not fail to call <hi>Stephen</hi> his Predeceſſor of Holy Memory, <hi>Piae recordationis predaeceſſorem.</hi> Upon which <hi>Baronius</hi> exhorts his Readers to Conſider, that although <note place="margin">

the <hi>Popes</hi> have had Predeceſſors very worthy of blame, yet they have been wont notwithſtanding to have a great deal of reſpect for them. So that, ſays he, although <hi>Stephen</hi> had been a Deteſtable <hi>Pope,</hi> who had invaded the Sea, and who during his <hi>Papacy</hi> had committed all ſorts of Execrable crimes, yet <hi>John</hi> nevertheleſs calls him his Predeceſſor of Holy Memory; which may appear at leſt as ſtrange as the Moderation of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>Luther.</hi>

               <p>I might add to all that, another Example drawn from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the occaſion of her latter Schiſms.

               <p>He Excommunicated particularly all thoſe who ſhould hold his competitor for <hi>Pope,</hi> or who ſhould call him <hi>Pope,</hi> or who ſhould receive any Favours, Indulgences, Dignities or Prelacies from him.

He abſolved alſo the ſubjects of thoſe Princes who ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his <hi>Anti-Pope,</hi> of their Oath of Allegiance, and he Excommunicated thoſe ſubjects themſelves if they ſhould yield any obedience to their Soveraigns.

                     <hi>Prejug</hi> Ch. 12. Pag. 311.</note> of the Prejudices does not think that theſe Examples are to the purpoſe. He ſays, <hi>That the Difference between</hi> Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, and</hi> Saint <hi>Jerome, and</hi> Saint <hi>Cyril, reſpected only perſonal Actions, in which none ever denied but that it might happen to the Saints themſelves to be ſurprized in reſpect of one another.</hi> But this is only a ſhift, for if we may underſtand that it has hapned to the Saints to be violently carried out againſt another Saint after the fierceſt manner in the World, upon perſonal differences which have no other Foundations then a Surpriſe, I ſee not why we may
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:97749:125"/>
not alſo underſtand, that it may happen to good men to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently carried out againſt one another, about the points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which afford a more juſt pretence of Animoſity, when each thinks he has the Truth of his ſide. Before I let go this Example, I cannot forbear noting, by the by, that it is but very ill to the purpoſe that the Author of the Prejudices cenſures M. <hi>Daille</hi> for having ſaid that <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, Excommunicated, and depoſed <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> from his Biſhoprick, for it is evident to thoſe who are not ignorant of Hiſtory, that <hi>Theophilus</hi> condemned and depoſed him, and that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> being gone to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> before that ſame condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, refuſed to hold Communion with <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> which is preciſely that which M. <hi>Daille</hi> would have ſaid. But the Author of the Prejudices does not Anſwer me better upon the Quarrel of Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Stephen; Their difference,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was only upon a point which had not then been decided by the Church.</hi> This Evaſion <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 312.</note> is very pittiful. The more trivial the occaſion is about which one is violent, that paſſion is both the more blameable, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt the perſons who are ſo carried away with it is the better grounded. To Anſwer after that manner aggravates the paſſion of <hi>Stephen,</hi> in ſtead of excuſing it. <hi>Stephen,</hi> adds he, <hi>who had more reaſon at the bottom, was carried out by the ardour of his Zealonly to ſome threats of Excommunication. Or if you will, to an Excommunication which having had no ground would have produced no real diviſion, and would not have hindred but that</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian ſhould still have been honoured by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and</hi> Saint <hi>Stephen by that of Africa.</hi> It is not certain that <hi>Stephen</hi> had more reaſon at the bottom then Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> on the contrary there were in their days as many Hereticks at leaſt, whoſe Baptiſm ought to have been rejected, as there was whoſe ought to have been admitted. And as for the reſt, whether <hi>Stephen</hi> had in effect Excommunicated Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or whether he had meerly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, what is that to our Queſtion? If he contented himſelf with a meer Threatning of it, he remained in Communion with a man whom he called <hi>a falſe Chriſt, a. falſe Apoſtle, a. deceitful Worker, and with a man whom on his part he accuſed of Stupidity, of Pride, of Obſtinacy, of Preſumption, of Folly, of blindneſs of Mind, and of Wickedneſs.</hi> He abode in Communion with <hi>Firmilianus</hi> who had the ſame intereſts with Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and who alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <hi>Stephen of Inhumanity, Boldneſs, of Inſolence, of Schiſm, and manifeſt Folly, who compared him to Judas, and ſaid of him</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:97749:125"/>
                  <hi>that he took part with Hereticks.</hi> If he actually Excommunicated them, it further notes the exceſs of his Paſſion, which could not in effect have been Judged to have been leſs then a Paſſion and a violent heat, ſince according to the Author of the Prejudices himſelf, it would have had no ground, and would not have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred but that Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſhould have been always honoured by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since the Author of the Prejudices was in the way to refute the Anſwer of M. <hi>Daille,</hi> it had poſſibly more conduced to the publick Edification, if in ſtead of ſhallowly inſiſting on thoſe remote Examples, he had applied himſelf to that wherein M. <hi>Daille</hi> adjoyns, the fierce injuries, wherewith the Divines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church may be every day ſeen to rend one another, although they then remain and though they yet live in one and the ſame Communion. They acknowledge one another for Brethren, they aſſiſt at the ſame Altars, they call upon the ſame Saints, and yet nevertheleſs, as M. <hi>Daille</hi> relates, they write one againſt another after the moſt paſſionate and violent manner in the World. One ſort of them ſay of their Adverſaries, <hi>That they were infected with Hereſies, and were Enemies of the Apoſtolick See, and that their Opinion was full of Hereſie and Perfidiouſneſs; That it was Preſumptious, Injurious to the State of the Religious, and that it ſavoured of</hi> Calviniſm, <hi>and to ſpeak Plainly, that it was Erroneous in the Faith, that it openly ſtifled the word of God and the Authority of the Fathers, that it was blaſphemous againſt Jeſus Chriſt and all the Saints, plainly and evidently Heretical, and contrary to the Council of</hi> Trent. The others ſay on the contrary <hi>That the Propoſitions which they have laid down were falſe, raſh, preſumptious, pernitious to all faithful People, that they were Erroneous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the Biſhops, tending to overthrow or diſturb the Hierarchy, and that ſome were even contrary to the word of God and the Authority of the Councils.</hi> They add that a certain Book of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries was full of Propoſitions <hi>that were Dangerous, Seditious, Impious, Schiſmatical, Blaſphemous, with ſome openly Heretical.</hi> See here what M. <hi>Daille</hi> has ſet down immediatly after the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Cyril,</hi> Saint <hi>Jerome, Stephen,</hi> and Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in which it had been well if the Author of the Prejudices would have ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us, for he cannot be ignorant that we could urge this matter a great deal further then M. <hi>Daille</hi> has done, and that he who would make up a Collection of all the Injuries that theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay of one another, would make a very ſtrange Vocabulary.

But he has Judged that he ought to paſs over this Article in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and that it was more fit for his purpoſe to anſwer only upon Saint <hi>Cyril,</hi> Saint <hi>Jerome, Stephen</hi> and Saint <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howſoever it be, it ſeems to be clear to me by what I have ſaid, a very ill prejudice in matters of Religion, to make the Judgment that we ought to make of a Doctrine to depend upon that that we may make of the Perſons, inſtead of Judging it by the Doctrine it ſelf and by the word of God; and the Author of the Prejudices may ſuffer us, if he pleaſes, to ſay to him on the Part of our firſt Reformers, what Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaid on the Part of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> to <hi>Creſconius. Since you are not the Judge of the</hi>

                  <hi>inward motions of our heart, ſet your ſelves only to know whether we fight for, or againſt the Truth. For if we Teach the Truth, if we refute Error, when our intentions ſhould not be good, and if we ſhould ſeek either for ſecular advantages, or vain-glory, thoſe who have a love for the Truth will not avoid joyning with us, ſince it would be the Truth that would be always declared, after what manner ſoever it were ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides thoſe two Remarks which I have made, I muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take notice in the Third place, that the Reaſoning of the Author of the Prejudices, is founded upon another ſuppoſition which is not leſs unjuſt, nor leſs raſh then thoſe other Two which I have examined. For it is founded upon this Principle, That we ought to Judge of Perſons meerly by that ill which appears in them; whereas in order to the making an equitable Judgment, we ought at leaſt to conſider the good with the ill, and after having made an exact diſcernment of the one and the other, to approve of that good that may be ſeen, and to blame that bad that may be found there. It was after this manner that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> paſſed their Judgments on <hi>Luther,</hi> and that we Judge him alſo; we diſcover a great many Excellent things in him, an Heroical Courage, a great Love for the Truth, an ardent Zeal for the Glory of God, a great Truſt in his Providence, Extraordinary Learning in a dark Age, a profound reſpect of the Holy Scripture, an indefatigable Spirit, and a great many other high Qualities. We ſee that he was in his Time one of the firſt who had their Eyes opened to conſider the Errors and Abuſes that were then currant in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, that he earneſtly applyed himſelf to it, that his Example excited divers others to do the ſame, that he endured upon that Account very great Perſecutions, under all which his heart never failed, and that by his Cares and Learned Labours he
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:97749:126"/>
recovered divers people out of the Superſtition wherein they were buried. Under this proſpect we cannot but give him the Juſt praiſe which we believe he merits; and becauſe we know that God is <hi>the Author of every perfect gift,</hi> as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſays, we attribute all the good that we ſee in <hi>Luther</hi> to his Grace and his Holy Spirit, and all the happy Succeſſes of his Preaching to the Divine Benediction, looking upon him as a ſervant of God, and an inſtrument which he made uſe of, for the work of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But becauſe there is no perſon in the World who has not his Exceſſes and his Faults, amidſt that which <hi>Luther</hi> had of praiſe worthy, we ſee alſo a great many things which we know not how to approve. We believe that he had not light enough about the matter of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> we find that he was very much prepoſſeſſed about the Real preſence, we acknowledge that his ſtile was too impetuous and too violent, and we make no ſcruple to ſay that he has not well enough diſtinguiſhed his differing opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſo as to be able to ſupport them without breaking the bond of Communion with thoſe who could not tolerate them, which makes him fall into a great piece of injuſtice in reſpect of us. Thus far, methinks, we may go without impugning Chriſtian Charity, if any one among us have puſhed his Judgment further, and would needs have Penetrated into the heart of <hi>Luther,</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute his Actions to the Principles of Jealouſy, of Pride, and Hatred, as the Author of the Prejudices ſays that <hi>Hoſpinian</hi> has done, it is what we do not approve of. For there is nothing in the World wherein we are more eaſily deceived then in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which we paſs upon the internal Principles of any ones Actions. We may ſay, this Action is good, this Action is not good; but when one Action may proceed from divers differing Principles, we ought to Judge with Charity; or if there be no place for a Judgment of Charity, the ſureſt way is not to Judge at all, but to leave it to the knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>If the Author of the Prejudices had followed this Rule, he had never attributed, as he has done, our carriage towards <hi>Luther</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> to a piece of <hi>Human Policy:</hi> he had ſaid on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that it was the effect of a Juſt Diſcernment, which we could not tell how to hinder our ſelves from making without being culpable. We blame in <hi>Luther</hi> and in the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> what we Judge to be blamable there, we commend that therein which we Judge to be commendable; we bear with that which we believe to be tolerable without approving it, and if there be any exceſs
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:97749:127"/>
either in that Praiſe, or Blame, or Toleration, we are ready to amend it, when they ſhall make us to perceive it. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we chuſe rather to incline towards the ſide of Charity, then towards that of Rigor, and we would be much rather in a ſtate, wherein by the Mediation of the grace of God, all ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, animoſity, harſh expreſſions, accuſations, complaints might be for ever baniſhed, then that we ſhould baniſh our Praiſes and Toleration. We will always preſerve towards the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſame Charity and the ſame Juſtice, as much as it ſhall be poſſible for us to do; but in Obſerving that equality, we are grieved to ſee that we cannot but make very differing Judgments of her, and of thoſe of the Confeſſion of <hi>Auſburg,</hi> and which produce contrary effects in us. Theſe latter are in difference with us only about the point of the Real preſence, and about ſome Queſtions of the Schools which we cannot yet impute to their whole Body; and as for the reſt, they reject with us the Invocation of Saints, Religious Worſhip of Images, humane Satisfactions, Indulgences, Purgatory, worſhip of Reliques, the publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in an unknown Tongue, the merit of good Works, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> the Monarchy of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the opinion of the Infallibility of the Church, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of blind obedience to the deciſions of Councils. They acknowledge the Scriptures to be the only Rule of Faith, they carefully practiſe the Reading of them, they own their ſufficiency, they believe their Authority independant from that of the Church, in regard of men. They diſtinctly explain the Doctrine of Juſtification, and that of the uſe of the Law, and its diſtinction from the Goſpel, they do not conceive amiſs of the nature of Faith, and that of good works, and as for popular ſuperſtitions, we can ſcarce ſee any reign among them. Would to God the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were in that condition, and that we could pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it at the price of our Blood and our Lives. But alas! We are very far from ſeeing any likely-hood of ſucceſs to that wiſh; all thoſe points that I have ſet down, are ſo many differences which we have with her; and in our Judgments, there are ſo many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and ſo many abuſes in her; and we are ſo far from any reaſonable hope of their Correction, that we ſee on the contrary that they ſtrengthen themſelves in them every day, and that they diſcover every day more and more ſigns of their averſion for, or contempt of a Reformation. Who therefore can think it ſtrange that upon the buſineſs of Religion we place a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:97749:127"/>
between thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and thoſe who are called <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the one appears to us as a Body ſpread all over with a great many boils, which all together put a ſtop to the Functions of Life, and the others, as a Body that has only one or two which do not hinder its Life, or its Action. In a word, we do not believe that thoſe who have imbibed the <hi>Tenets</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, where we differ from them, and who practice them, are in the way of Salvation, as well by reaſon of the Quality of the greateſt part of thoſe <hi>Tenets,</hi> as by reaſon of their number. But as to the Errors which remain yet among the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> we do not paſs the ſame Judgment, either as to their Quality or their number. I ſay as to their Quality, and the reaſon that we alledge is is very ſolid, whatſoever endeavors they have uſed to elude it, for although the opinion of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> about the Real preſence be erroneous, though we are ſo far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of it, that we oppoſe it as much as poſſibly we can, yet while they ſhall make a profeſſion, as they do, to diſtinguiſh in the Sacrament the ſubſtance of bread from that of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, we cannot ſay that their Error compels them actually to adore the meer creature of Bread, for the ſame Body of Jeſus Chriſt that is hypoſtatically united with the word. We can very well ſay that they deceive themſelves in imagining that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is in a place where it is not, but we cannot tell them that they take another ſubject for the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which really and in effect is not ſo. They do not therefore deceive themſelves in regard of the Object of their Adoration, for they do not take the one for the other; I would ſay they do not take the ſubſtance of Bread for the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, but they deceive themſelves in regard of the place wherein they conceive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt to be, for they conceive it to be in the Bread, and it is not there. But this Error about the place, how groſs ſoever it be, does not, notwithſtanding, include Idolatry, for as I have ſaid, they do not take one ſubject for another, the ſubſtance of Bread for the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. But it is otherwiſe in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for if ſhe deceives her ſelf, ſhe does it not only as to the place wherein ſhe conceives the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, but alſo as to the ſubject that ſhe takes for the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, ſince it is in effect but the ſubſtance of Bread. There is actually and really in the Sacrament but one only ſubſtance, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not diſtinguiſh it from the Object of her Adoration, on the contrary ſhe delieves it to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97749:128"/>
ſhe Adores it under that Quality, if ſhe deceives her ſelf, it is manifeſt that in believing ſhe adores the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe adores that which is actually the ſubſtance of Bread. It is to no purpoſe therefore that the Author of the Prejudices ſays, <hi>That it is falſe that the Catholicks adore the Sacrament in taking that word for an external Vail.</hi> That makes nothing to the Queſtion. Whether they adore or do not adore the accidents of Bread, that is to ſay its figure, colour, roundneſs, is a thing by it ſelf, whereof we do not now diſpute, we ſpeak now of the ſubſtance which the Prieſt holds in his hands. But it is yet nothing to the purpoſe what he further adds, <hi>That although the Bread ſhould remain there, as the Lutherans hold, yet we could not accuſe the Catholicks of adoring it, their adoration terminates upon Jeſus Chriſt alone, whom they believe to lie hid under thoſe ſenſible ſpecies.</hi> This is an Ordinary Fallacy of their Miſſionaries, fit only to deceive Children. I diſtinguiſh, We cannot accuſe thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of believing that they adore the Bread, or of being willing to adore it, or of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an intention to adore the Bread; I grant it, for they believe that it is no longer Bread, they believe that the ſubſtance of Bread is changed into that of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that they can never be accuſed of believing that they adore, or that they are willing to adore, or that they have an intention to adore the Bread. They defend themſelves in that whereof no Body accuſes them. But if the bread remain in effect no Bread, I deny that we cannot accuſe them of adoring, that which is actually and in the Truth of the thing, Bread, in believing that it is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and a man muſt be of a very bad faith not to ſee it. For if I ſhould imagine, for example, that a Tree, that a Rock, that a flower was a God hid under the form of a Tree, a Rock, a Flower, and if I ſhould adore it under that Quality of a God which my imagination gave it, it would be paſt all doubt that I ſhould adore a Tree, a Rock, a Flower, in believing my ſelf to adore God.</p>
               <p>But beſides that we are, in regard of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> in very different Terms from thoſe, wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have us that we ſhould be with her: For in reſpect of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> the buſineſs is only about a meer Toleration, which we give to thoſe among them who deſire it, with a Spirit of Charity, waiting till it ſhall pleaſe God to diſſipate their Error. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that calls it ſelf infallible, would have us not only to have a meer Toleration for her, but that we ſhould make a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:97749:128"/>
profeſſion of believing all that ſhe believes; for when ſhe ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated her ſelf from us, ſhe Anathematiſed all thoſe who did not believe all that ſhe had decided in her Council of Trent. The Matters therefore are not equal between the <hi>Roman</hi> and the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Communion in reſpect of us. To put them into an Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it is neceſſary that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhould openly put her ſelf into the ſtate wherein the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are, that ſhe renounce the Invocation of Saints, Religious worſhip of Images, humane Satisfactions, Indulgences, Purgatory, the worſhipping of Rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, the publick Service in an unknown Tongue, the merit of good Works, Tranſubſtantiation, Adoration of the Sacrament, the Sacrifice of the <hi>Meſs,</hi> the <hi>Papal Monarchy,</hi> the pretenſion of Infallibility, the blind Obedience that ſhe would have us give to her deciſions. It is neceſſary, that ſhe ſhould acknowledge the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the only rule of faith and manners, that ſhe ſhould care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully recommend the Reading of them to the People, that ſhe ſhould confeſs their ſufficiency without the help of <hi>tradition,</hi> that ſhe ſhould believe the Authority of that Scripture, independent (even in reſpect of us) on that of the Church, that ſhe ſhould diſtinctly lay down the Doctrine of Juſtification, and that of the diſtinction of the Law and the Goſpel, that ſhe ſhould form a Juſt <hi>Idea</hi> of the Faith, and of good works, and that ſhe ſhould take care to aboliſh all the popular Superſtitions which we behold among them. When ſhe ſhall have done all that, with ſome other things which the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> have done alſo, although ſhe do retain the point of the Real preſence after the ſame manner that they do, we ſhall not fail to offer her the ſame Toleration which we yield to the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> and the ſame conditions which we give to them; which is, that we ſhould not engage our ſelves to believe that preſence, that we ſhould always proteſt againſt it as an Error, and that they ſhall do nothing to force us to embrace it. When the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be in that condition which I have ſet down, if we do not make her theſe offers, if we do not even make them with all the ardour imaginable, we will be very well contented in that Caſe, that they ſhould accuſe us of humane Policy, and that they ſhould tell us that we are a ſort of men without any Conſcience, Juſtice, and Charity. But 'till then we will take God and men to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that there is not the leaſt equity in thoſe invectives, and that it is to oppreſs our innocency, to aſcribe that, as the Author of the Prejudices has done, to an intereſted Policy, or a capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious humour, which is but too well founded upon the things themſelves.</p>

                     <hi>That our Fathers, in their Deſign of Reforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were bound to take the Holy Scripture alone for the Rule of their Faith.</hi>

               <p>IT it now neceſſary to Examine by what Principle, or upon what Rule our Fathers proceeded in their Reformation. But before we go any further, we ſhall do well to weigh what the Author of the Prejudices ſays, who has made an expreſs Chapter upon this matter. The Argument of that Chapter is framed in theſe words. <hi>That the way which the Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi>

                  <hi>propound to inſtruct men in the Truth, is ridiculous and impoſſible.</hi> After having entred upon his ſubject, <hi>As the matter is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>about the promiſe which they make of diſcovering divers Truths of the Faith to the Catholicks, which are in their Judgments obſcured and quite altered in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>there will be nothing more Juſt, or more natural, then in the firſt place to inquire into the way, which they would take to perform it, to the end that we may Judge by the very nature of that way what we may juſtly expect. For if it be found that they would engage us in an infinite way, and which could not come to an iſſue, there could not be a more lawful excuſe to hinder us from hearkening to them, nor a more evident conviction of the raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their enterpriſe.</hi> Behold here, methinks, Two Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that Author ſufficiently expreſs, concerning the means which we propound to inſtruct men in the Truth, the one, <hi>That it is a ridiculous and impoſſible way;</hi> and the other, That it is an <hi>infinite</hi> way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which can come to no iſſue; for we may well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that that Periphraſis of expreſſion, <hi>If it be found that they would engage us in an infinite way,</hi> &amp;c. made uſe of, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Diſputation, means, that it will be ſo found in effect, and that it is as much as if it had been poſitively ſaid, <hi>they would engage us in an infinite way, and which has no end,</hi> there being no other difference between thoſe two expreſſions, unleſs that this latter is the more plain, and that the other has more of the Air of the <hi>Philoſophical Method</hi> of thoſe Gentlemen. After that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble the Author goes on. <hi>It is true,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that if we will hear them ſpeak upon this ſubject without any more deep ſearehing into</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:97749:130"/>
                  <hi>that which they ſay, we ſhall have reaſon enough to be ſatisfied. For they baldly promiſe to lead us to the Faith, by a ſhort, an eaſy and a clear way, without confuſion, without danger of wandring aſide, and this way ſay they, is the Examination of the Articles of the Faith by the Scripture, which is the only Rule that God has given us for the deciding of the differences of Religion, and aſſuring us of what we ought to believe, all others being ſubject to Error.</hi> This is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the way which we propoſe, which is to take the Holy Scripture for the only Rule of our Faith. He adds, <hi>But becauſe in a matter of this importance we ſhould take the greateſt care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void dazling our ſight with words that would have more of ſhew then Solidity, it will be good to inform our ſelves more exactly whether this way is ſo eaſy as they repreſent it, whether there do not occur ſome Obſtacles that hinder our paſſing further, and whether it be not of ſo exceſſive a length, that we ought not rationally to hope to come to the end of it, whatſoever diligence we uſe; whether it be fitted to all the World, and whether there be not any perſon who may not going on faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in it, arrive to the end whether it leads.</hi> Behold here another Concluſion againſt our way, inwraped under a <hi>ſo,</hi> to wit, <hi>that it is of a length ſo exceſſive, as we ought not rationally to hope ever to get to the end, whatſoever diligence we uſe, and that at leaſt, it is not fitted to all the World.</hi> In what follows he fills his Chapter with the Objections and difficulties that tend to turn away men from the Scripture, and to make them conceive that in effect it is <hi>that infinite way which has no iſſue at all,</hi> of which he had ſpoke, <hi>and that way of ſo exceſſive a length that we could never come to the end of, whatſoever Diligence we ſhould uſe.</hi> But the meaning of that is, that according to him, the way to be aſſured of the Articles of the Faith by the Scripture, is abſolutely unprofitable to all men, of what order ſoever they be, and for what Truth ſoever it be. For an infinite way which has no iſſue, and the length of which is ſo exceſſive that we could never with all the diligence we ſhould uſe come to the end of it, is equally unprofitable to all, as well to the Learned, as the Ignorant. And moreover, the greateſt part of the difficulties that render it infinite, according to him, being not to be found in ſome private paſſages, but in the Scripture in general, it follows that we can never be aſſured by that means of any Truth. So that, behold here, according to the Author of the Prejudices, the Scripture abſolutely unprofitable, and that for all ſorts of men, and all ſorts of Truths. In one word, as the Tilte of his Chapter bears, it is <hi>a ridiculous way, and impoſſible to inſtruct men in the Truth.</hi>

Whatſoever Prejudice there has been in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the Reformation, I cannot believe that it would not be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at ſo ſcandalons and un-Chriſtian a Propoſition. For to treat the holy Scripture, which is the Oracle of Chriſtians, and the word of God, as a ridiculous way, and to reject it as abſolutely unprofitable, and improper to inſtruct men in the Truth, without diſtinction, without Limitation, as much for one ſort as for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as much for one truth as for another, is methinks a new Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which we have not yet heard ſpoken of, for there was never any thing ſpoke ſo high till this, or to ſay better, none were ever yet carried out to ſuch Exceſſes. We have read in <hi>Pamelius</hi> and <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>There are enough in the world who know that theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of whoſe number the Author of the Prejudices is, write no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but for one and the ſame Intreſt, and with the ſame Spirit. I may therefore, methinks, with very good reaſon make uſe for this occaſion, of what the Author of the Tranſlation of the New Teſtament of <hi>Mons</hi> has wrote in his Preface, to oppoſe it to the Author of the Prejudices, to ſhew him that the Spirit that animates them is an unequal Spirit, that blows both cold and hot. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what that Preface carries in it; <hi>We hope that not only the Souls of the more learned but even of the Simpler ſort may find here</hi> (that is to ſay in the Tranſlation) <hi>that which ſhall be neceſſary for their inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, provided that they read at with an intire Simplicity of heart, and Addreſs themſelves humbly to the Son of God in ſaying to him with</hi> Peter <hi>Lord, to whom ſhould we go?

But that which ought to comfort us in that Obſcurity, is, that according to Saint</hi> Auguſtine <hi>the holy Scripture ſets before us in an</hi> Eaſy and Intelligible manner, all that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to us for the Conduct of our Lives, <hi>which ſhe</hi> explains, <hi>and</hi> makes clear her ſelf, <hi>in telling us</hi> clearly <hi>in ſome Places, that which ſhe ſaid</hi> obſcurely <hi>in others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Language is very different from that which they hold in the Book of the Prejudices: The one ſays, That we ſhall find in the Scripture all that which is <hi>neceſſary</hi> for our Inſtruction; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſures us, that the way of the Scripture is <hi>Ridiculous and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible</hi> to inſtruct men in the Truth. The one declares that the Scripture propounds to us after an <hi>Eaſy and Intelligible manner</hi> all that is neceſſary for the Conduct of our lives, which it explains and makes clear her ſelf; and the other ſays, that it is a way <hi>of ſo exceſſive a length</hi> that we ought not rationally to hope ever to come to the end, whatſoever dilligence we ſhould uſe. The one makes it a means of Inſtruction, proper not only for Inlightned Souls, but even for the <hi>Simpler ſort,</hi> for great and ſmall, for ſtrong and weak; and the other in making it an Infinite way which has no Iſſue, makes it improper not only for the ſimple, but even for the moſt learned. The one extends its uſe unto all that is <hi>Neceſſary</hi> for Inſtruction and the Conduct of life, and the other in heaping up of general difficulties, makes it unprofitable to Inſtruct us in the leaſt Truths. What Judgment can we make of this diverſity, unleſs this, that the language of theſe Gentlemen changes accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the difference of Times and Intereſts, as one has ſaid of them elſewhere. When the caſe is about gaining credit to their Tranſlation of the New Teſtament, they ſpeak as advantagiouſly of the Scripture as it is poſſible for them to ſpeak; and when the buſineſs is to oppoſe a Reformation made according to the Rule of the Scripture, but which notwithſtanding has not the happineſs of their Agreement, you ſee what they ſay of that ſame Scripture. The Scripture ſhall then, to ſpeak properly, be only to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, by the Intreſt of their Tranſlation, and as long as that Intereſt ſhall remain, ſhall be <hi>the Collection of the divine Teachings</hi>

                  <hi>Father, The mouth of Jeſus Chriſt, who although he is in Heaven ſpeaks continually upon earth, not only the nouriſhment of ſound Souls and thoſe who are eſtabliſh'd in grace, as the Body of the Son of God, but even the Conſolation of Sinners, the light of the blind, the remedy of the Sick, and the life of the dead.</hi> For theſe are the Titles that the Preface gives it; but whenever that Intereſt ſhall ceaſe, thoſe praiſes ſhall do ſo too, and it ſhall be nothing <hi>but a Ridiculous way, and impoſſible for the Inſtructing of men in the Truth.</hi> I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very fain know of theſe Gentlemen, whether it were only upon the ſight of their Tranſlation, that <hi>S. Cyprian, S. Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>S. Gregory,</hi> wrote that which the Preface relates, or whether thoſe Fathers did not conſider the Scripture in it ſelf. For if it be the firſt, they forgot to tell us that they only ſpake out of a Prophetick Spirit of that Tranſlation; and if it be the Second, why have they entertained us with that admirable proportion of the Scripture to great and ſmall, to the ſtrong and weak, and that eaſy and intelligible manner wherewith it propounds to us all that is neceſſary for the Conduct of our life ſince that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Tranſlation of <hi>Mons,</hi> it is an Infinite way, which has no end, a ridiculous way, and Impoſſible to Inſtruct men in the Truth?</p>
               <p>What can the Author of the Prejudices ſay to defend himſelf from this Manifeſt Contradiction which he diſcovers between him and his Colleague? Will he ſay, that the Scripture is in truth a good means for the Inſtruction of men; but that it is ſo, only with the Interpretations of the Fathers? But the Author of that Preface ſpeaks for Scripture alone, ſeparated from the Interpretation of the Fathers, ſuch as its Tranſlation is; for he excuſes himſelf in that he had not made a collection of notes and explanations drawn out of the writings of the holy Fathers, and he does not fail to ſay that in his Tranſlation, as plain as it is, not only the Souls of the more learned, but of the more ſimple alſo and unlearned, may find that which will be neceſſary for their Inſtruction. Will he ſay, that he does not mean to exclude the learned from the uſe of the Scripture, but only the more ſimple, for the Inſtruction of which former, he does not deny but that it would be a moſt proper means. But beſides, that his Brother ſpeaks formally of the Inſtruction of the more ſimple, why has the Author of the Prejudices made it a ridiculous and Impoſſible way, an infinite way which has no Iſſue, a way which is of ſo exceſſive a length, that one can never rationally hope to come to the end of it, whatſoever diligence
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:97749:132"/>
one ſhould make? Will he ſay that the Scripture ought to be joined with Tradition, and that without Tradition it cannot give a perfect Inſtruction? But the Preface ſays expreſly, that they will find in that Tranſlation all that will be neceſſary for Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Will he ſay that in order to the Scriptures Inſtructing one, the Sence of the Church ought to be added to it? But the Preface ſays, that according to Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Scripture lays down all that is neceſſary for the Conduct of our lives after a moſt eaſy and Intelligible manner, and that ſhe explains and makes clear her ſelf. Will he ſay that in order to the Scriptures being capable to Inſtruct us, we ought at leaſt to read it with Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the Church, and to take it from her hand? But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then would theſe Gentlemen have the People to read their Tranſlation, ſince they are only private Doctors, and not the Church?

                  <hi>Church, and not only to the Biſhops, who have no right to deprive the Faithful of them.

                  <hi>would he perſwade the Faithful too, but that the Faithful ought to take very great heed not to read the Holy Scripture, and not to meditate day and night upon the words of life, that the Spirit of God has dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Prophets, and which God the Father has given to his Son for the Inſtruction of his Church, and to draw it from the Corruption of the world, to render it Holy and without Spot to his Father, who gave it to him—Jeſus Chriſt was the Word uf God, and liv'd by that Word, and to make his Church live, he gave it his word in an Intelligible Tongue, out of his own mouth, and by his Diſciples: Search, ſays he, and examine carefully the Scriptures, for they are they which Teſtify of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is that they ſpeak of it ſometimes, Jeſus Chriſt gave his Scripture to the Faithful, with a Commandment to read it, to examine it carefully, and to hear it. It was the Judge of the beleif of the Church, and the Difficulties and Queſtions that aroſe in the Doctrine of the Faith and Manners. The Pariſhioners made uſe of them againſt their Biſhops, They encountred even their Ordinances by paſſages out of that Scripture, they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that the uſe of them belonged to all Chriſtians by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral right, and that to go about to deprive them of them, was to do an action of the Devil. But now a days they ſpeak no more after that manner, for they tell us on the contrary that it is a Ridiculous and Impoſſible way to Inſtruct men in the Truth, an Infinite way which has no Iſſue, and which is of ſo exceſſive a length that whatſoever dilligence we ſhould uſe, we can never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to the end, and they labour to heap difficulties upon difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to drive them back, and to make a Labyrinth full of Circles and confus'd ways, that ſo out of a fear of thoſe Confuſions the world ſhould take heed of entring into it.</p>
               <p>For my own part I freely acknowledg, That I can comprehend nothing in all that. For if, before one can aſſure ones ſelf of one only Paſſage of Scripture, whatſoever it be, we muſt needs go through a thouſand tedious ways, and overcome a thouſand Obſtacles that ariſe from the Queſtion about the Canonical Books, about the Conformity of the Tranſlations with the Originals,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:97749:133"/>
about the different manner of reading the Paſſages, and about the difference of Interpretations, as the Author of the Prejudices would have it, according to his ordinary Exaggeration, to what purpoſe is it to give the publick a Tranſlation, which after the manner that it was given and receiv'd in, cannot but be ſubject to the greateſt part of thoſe difficulties; and yet notwithſtanding, they put it into all mens hands, as well the Ignorant as the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well of the ſimple as the more Inlightned, as well to women as to men. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has not declared it Authentick, Two Biſhops and a Doctor have approved it, but two Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and a Cardinal, have forbidden it; and yet one has not failed, notwithſtanding thoſe Prohibitions, to maintain, that all the world ought to read them, and that that forbidding them is <hi>a Violence, a Novelty, an unexampled Enterpriſe, a bold Attempt upon the Liberty that God has given to the Church, ranſomed at the</hi>

                  <hi>price of the Blood of his own Son, that it is an uſurpation, and the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of a Tyrannical Authority that was never excerciſed in the Church until this day—and that every one is bound not only not to obey that Ordinance, but even to have an Horror for it, and to reſiſt it as much as he can.</hi> What will then become of thoſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and thoſe unconquerable Confufions which hinder them, according to the Author of the Prejudices, ſo that they cannot aſſure themſelves of one only Paſſage of the Scripture, through the uncertaitty wherein a man is of the unfaithfulneſs of the Tranſlations; through the Ignorance wherein we are of the different manner of reading thoſe Paſſages; and through the neceſſity of conſulting Interpreters? Is it becauſe they would expreſly engage the People <hi>in an Infinite way and which can come to no Iſſue,</hi> and in a <hi>ridiculous way,</hi> and <hi>which is Impoſſible for the Inſtructing of any in the Truth?</hi> or is it rather becauſe they did not propound to themſelves in that Tranſlation to Inſtruct men in the Truths of the Faith, but only to ſatisfy their Curioſity, and to make them read good <hi>French?</hi> The Author of the Prejudices may acknowledge therefore if he pleaſes, that the heat of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation has carried him beyond the bounds of Right and Reaſon, and the reſpect which he ought to have for the word of God, and that in endeavouring to have troubled us, he has done it for himſelf and his Freinds; for if that which he has propounded were true, they would give us a ground to accuſe thoſe who have publiſh'd the Tranſlation of <hi>Mons,</hi> of Raſhneſs and Imprudence. And it will be nothing to the purpoſe to ſay, that they Publiſh'd
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:97749:133"/>
it for thoſe perſons who were already Inſtructed in the Truths which the Church believes, that therein they might receive a Confirmation and increaſe of the Faith, by the Conformity which they ſhould find the Doctrines of the Church have with it, and that it was neceſſary for that that they ſhould go through all the difficulties which the Author of the Prejudices has worked, ſince the Sole Conformity of it with the Doctrines of the Church, would be ſufficient to aſſure them that it was truly the word of God. I ſay that anſwer will not ſatisfy; For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it is an Injury to the word of God to make the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy that it has in our Souls to depend upon the Conformity which it has with the Doctrine of the Church, whereas on the contrary the Efficacy of the Doctrine of the Church ought to depend on its Conformity with the word of God; beſides that, the Author of the Preface, ſays expreſly, <hi>That the Souls of the ſimpler ſort may find that in his Tranſlation which is neceſſary for their Inſtruction.</hi> He ſays not thoſe who ſhall be already Inſtructed in that which the Church teaches, but he ſays, the Simpler ſort, he does not ſay that they would be Confirmed in the Inſtruction which they had already, but that <hi>they would find that which ſhould be neceſſary for their Inſtruction.</hi> And elſewhere he ſays, <hi>That the word of God,</hi> that is to ſay in his Tranſlation, for it is about the Subject of that Tranſlation that he ſpeaks, <hi>is the Light of the Blind, and the Life of the Dead.</hi> Which ſignifies that it gives by it ſelf the firſt Impreſſions of the Spiritual Life. So that it was not in the view of the knowledge that the ſimple might have of the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that he publiſh'd that Tranſlation, if we believe the Pariſhioners of Saint <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Montanus;</hi> But on the contrary in the view of that Ignorance under which they were held. For ſee how they <note place="margin">

It were a ſmall matter if they would content themſelves with the not giving them the Bread of the Goſpel; They will not ſuffer them to take it, and if they take it, They ſnatch it out of their Hands; They do not Inſtruct them, and they would hinder them, ſo that they ſhould not Inſtruct thenſelves out of the word of God, and that that Prophecy ſhould not be accompliſh'd,</hi> Erunt omnes docibiles Deo, <hi>and they ſhall be taught of God.</hi>

I thought my ſelf bound to make theſe firſt Reflections, to ſhew the injuſtice and inequality of theſe men that we have to do with. <hi>Nihil est,</hi> ſays <hi>Cicero, quod minus ferendum ſit, quam rationem vitae ab altero repoſcere eum quinon poſſet ſuae reddere.</hi> Notwithſtanding after having a little cooled that impetuous motion of the Author of the Prejudices, I ſhall not fail to Juſtify our Fathers touching the Principle upon which they made their Reformation.</p>
               <p>I ſay then in the firſt place, That they could not in that State wherein things were, take the Church in their days for the Rule of their Faith, without renouncing Common ſence. The Church in their days, or to ſpeak better, that which they would call the Church, was made up of Three ſorts of perſons. The Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Prelats and the other Clergy, and the People. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was the ſource of all evil, it was that that had ſpread abroad all the Errors and Superſtitions in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, or that had at leaſt fomented and maintained them when they took their riſe elſewhere. Her Uſurpations and the diſorder of her Government, was one of the complaints of our Fathers. They complained of her Principles, her Maxims, and ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of the Faith which ſhe had cauſed to paſs in Councils that were ſervilely ſubjected to her will and her intereſts. She was therefore a reſolute party in this affair, evidently intereſted, and by conſequence uncapable of Judging. It is True that ſhe called her ſelf the Mother and the Miſtreſs of all Churches, and that one of her pretenſions was Infallibility in the Faith. But that very thing was one of the Errors of which our Fathers required a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, whatever probability ſhe had of aſcribing it to her ſelf. <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth acknowledged a great part of the diſorders of that Court, in his inſtructions to his <hi>Nuntio</hi> whom he ſent to the Diet of <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> as we have already ſeen, and the General voice of the whole Church, which demanded a long time ago a Reformation <hi>in capite &amp; membris,</hi> make it known enough to leave us out of all doubt. Moreover, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> did ſo loudly and vehemently declare her ſelf againſt a Reformation, that it could not be any further hoped for, and why ſhould our Fathers have taken her for the Rule of Faith, ſince not only the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church who lived in Communion with her, maintained that ſhe was not, but even the Experience of many years had very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhewed that ſhe could not be: Does not <hi>Tertullian,</hi> turned <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Montaniſt,</hi> Teſtify, That <hi>Eleutherius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had received
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:97749:134"/>
the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of <hi>Montanus,</hi> of <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Maximilla,</hi> and that he had already wrote Letters of Communion to the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Phrygia</hi> which were <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> and that thoſe Letters ſhould have their effect, although <hi>Praxeas</hi> had not made them to be recalled, in relating falſe things concerning thoſe Churches and their Prophets? And has not the ſixth General Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Pope Honorius</hi> as a <hi>Monothelite</hi> Heretick, with <hi>Sergius Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triaerch</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſome others? I know that ſome have ſaid, that that Council was deceived in the buſineſs of <hi>Honorius;</hi> but without entring upon that Queſtion, in which it is certain that they deceive themſelves, as not long ſince <hi>P. Louis Thomaſſin,</hi> Prieſt of the Oratory, in his Diſſertation about that ſixth Council has acknowledged. It is enough that that Council condemned <hi>Honorius</hi> for an Heretick, and that it proſcribed his name and his Memory. For that Condemnation, after what manner ſoever it hapned, is an Authentick Declaration that a General Council has held, that <hi>Popes</hi> may Err, and by eonſequence that they are not the Rule of Faith. And it is nothing to the purpoſe to ſay, as <hi>P. Thomaſſin</hi> has done, that <hi>Henorius</hi> Erred only in the quality of a private man and not as <hi>Pope,</hi> or to ſpeak more properly, That he did not Err, but only that he had a mind to make uſe of a Diſpenſation for the procuring the peace of the Church, which was divided about the Queſtion whether there were two wills, and two operations in Jeſus Chriſt, or whether there was but one, and that he deſired that they would be ſilent about that point. Which ſide ſoever they chuſe, it will always follow from that Example of <hi>Honorius,</hi> that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> are not the Rule of Faith. For to make a Rule of Faith, it is not enough to be exempt from Error, either in quality of <hi>Popes,</hi> or even in the quality of private men, it is further neceſſary that they ſhould be always in a ſtate of not fomenting or entertaining Hereſy, but of oppoſing it on the contrary, of condemning it when it has made any progreſs, and of maintaining the True Faith. But this is that which they cannot ſay of <hi>Honorius,</hi> in reſpect of the Hereſy of the <hi>Monothelites.</hi> That Hereſy had over-ran all the Eaſt, the <hi>Patriarchates</hi> of the Eaſt were infected with it, the Emperour <hi>Heraclius</hi> had eſtabliſhed it by a publick Edict, a Council it ſelf held at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had confirmed it, whether therefore they ſay that <hi>Honorius</hi> embraced Hereſy in quality of a private man, or whether they ſay that by a falſe <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> he
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:97749:135"/>
would only have impoſed ſilence on the Orthodox, which way ſoever they take, it is manifeſt, that he was not in a ſtate under the quality of <hi>Pope,</hi> to put a ſtop to the courſe of Hereſy, nor to ſuccour the true Faith. For what likelyhood is there, that as <hi>Pope</hi> he ſhould have condemned himſelf as a private man; or that in quality of <hi>Pope,</hi> or as they ſpeak, <hi>ex cathedra,</hi> he ſhould have Publiſhed the Truth that ought to be held, while his own private opinion was that he ſhould hold his peace about it and ſuppreſs it. It is therefore a Mockery to make a Rule of Faith of ſuch a <hi>Pope,</hi> who through his own private Hereſy, or his imprudent <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> could not hinder <hi>Monotheliſm</hi> from Triumphing. And it cannot be a leſs one, if they ſhould pretend that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be the True Rule of Faith, while ſuch <hi>Popes</hi> are her Head, ſince ſhe can do nothing without them, and ſince they might render it incapable to defend the Truth.</p>
               <p>I paſs over in ſilence a multitude of other things, which ſenſibly ſhew us the falſeneſs of that pretence of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuch as are the lapſes of <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Liberius,</hi> the Contradictory deciſions of divers <hi>Popes,</hi> their inconſtancy, their capricious humours, their intereſted Judgments, and I know not how many other Characters incompatible with a true Rule of Faith. It is ſufficient to know that that pretence has never been publickly received in <hi>France,</hi> and that our Kings and our Parliaments have always moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently oppoſed it.</p>
               <p>As to the Prelats and the other Eccleſiaſticks, after the ſad Deſcriptions that we have given of their ſtate, in the days of our Fathers, and many Ages before them, there is no likelyhood that they can yet further with the leaſt ſhadow of Reaſon, propoſe them as a Juſt Rule of Faith, which way ſoever they are conſidered, whether in General, or in particular, whether ſeparated, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together. Their Ignorance, their negligence in ſpiritual things, their ſinking into vices, their exceſſive love of the World, and in a word all that which we have have ſeen in them, will not permit us to believe that we ſhould be bound to truſt abſolutely to their word, about the Subject of the Reformation. They had given but too many marks that they were ſubject to Error, ſince the greateſt part of thoſe things which were to be reformed came from them, or from thoſe who went before them. And beſides that they were themſelves expreſs parties in that affair, conſidering the complaints that they made of them, and that they
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:97749:135"/>
were engaged to uphold the ſuperſtitions in which they had held the People, we are not Ignorant that they had a ſervile depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to which they were bound by Oath that they would no ſtir, nor ſpeak, nor act but according to her Inſpirations, and her Orders, as experience has Juſtified it to us in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> In fine, their Prelats were men, and ſuch men as had made the Church to fall into that Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Corruption, out of which our Fathers ſought to get out, and how could they take them for an Infallible Rule?</p>
               <p>As for that which reſpects the people, if the Author of the Prejudices is, as is reported, the Author of the Treatiſe of the Perpetuity of the Faith, he would it may be fain make them paſs with us for Infallible, and give them to us to be the Rule of our Faith. But we have ſhewn him often enough already that he is deceived in his opinion. What was there more liable to deceive them, and more to incline them to abuſes and ſuperſtitions, then the people, and above all a people ignorant of the Myſteries of the Goſpel, ſuch as was for a long time that of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church? How could a people that ought themſelves to undo the falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions, with which they had been imbued, ſerve for the Rule of a Reformation?</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, if there had been nothing in the Body of the Church capable of being a Rule of Faith, why did your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers demand a Council to hear their Complaints, and give them a remedy? I anſwer that our Fathers demanded a Council not ſuch a one as that of <hi>Trent,</hi> made up of the Creatures of the <hi>Pope, who waited for the Holy Ghoſts coming from</hi> Rome <hi>in a Cloak-Bag,</hi> as the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks have reproached them; but ſuch a free Council as wherein they might yet have hoped that God would have preſided, and his word have been heard. They demanded it not as the Rule of Faith, blindly to ſubmit their Conſciences to all that which ſhould be there determined; for they well knew that they owed that ſubmiſſion only to God; but as a humane Ordinary means in the Church that Chriſtian Charity and the love of Order made them deſire, to try if they could not by that way re-eſtabliſh the purity of the Goſpel in the Weſt by the way of the Scripture, I acknowledge, that there had lain a great difficulty in the choice of perſons; but if yet notwithſtanding they would have proceeded ſincerely in it, and in the fear of God, without letting the intereſts of fleſh and blood enter in, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:97749:136"/>
were not unconquerable. Paſſion, Contention, a Spirit of Diviſion was not as yet generally ſpread over all, they were not as yet ſo obſtinate in Error as they have been ſince. All the Learned men that were then in it, acknowledged the neceſſity of a Reformation, and deſired it. They had therefore a ground to demand a free Council, and theſe who know Hiſtory; are not ignorant that to elude that demand which appeared to all the World to be ſo Juſt and Reaſonable, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> thought it needful to make uſe of the moſt deep and imperceptible piece of its Policy. But howſoever it be, there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a Council that ſhould ſubmit it ſelf to, and Rule it ſelf by, the Word of God, and between a Rule of Faith. Our Fathers might very well demand the firſt, and expect to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, although he ſtate of the Church was then extreamly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; for there was yet ſome good deſires, which without doubt would have wrought ſome effect, if they had not been ſtifled or turned aſide. But it does not follow from thence, that they muſt after what manner ſoever have taken that Church, for the Soveraign and Infallible Rule of their Religion.</p>
               <p>They would not have more reaſon to ſay, that we ought to turn to the ſide of <hi>Tradition,</hi> which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has raiſed to the ſame Honour and Authority with the Scripture; We ſhall quickly ſee which ought to have been believed. It ſhall ſuffice to ſay here, that although the greateſt part of the <hi>Roman Traditions</hi> are new, as the Proteſtants have often demonſtrated them to be, yet that in the Age of our Fathers which was as it were the ſink of the foregoing, there was ſcarce any Error, nor any Superſtition how groſs ſoever, that they did not labour to defend, under the pretence of <hi>Tradition,</hi> ſo that <hi>Tradition</hi> is ſo far from being able to ſerve for a Rule, that it ought it ſelf to be corrected and regulated according to that Maxim of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>In the beginning it was not ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Antient Fathers, I confeſs that their Writings may be of great uſe to Learned men, to furniſh them with a great meaſure of knowledge; but they can never have Authority ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſerve for a Rule of Faith. The Fathers were men ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Errour, to Prejudices, and Surpriſes, as well as other men, and there appear but too many ſigns of it in their Writings. They have ſubmitted themſelves to the Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. They have called it, <hi>the balance and exact Rule of all things,</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:97749:136"/>
                  <hi>a ſure Anchor, and Foundation of the Faith.</hi> They have taken, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chryſoſt. hom.</hi> 13. <hi>in</hi> 2. <hi>Cor. Athanaſ, in Synops.</hi>
                  </note> in their Controverſies Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaking in his Goſpel, for their Judge. They have Exhorted their Hearers and their Readers, to believe them only ſo far as their words ſhould be found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by proofs drawn from the Scripture. They have ſaid that <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>It is Evident therefore, that our Fathers could not take any other Rule of the Faith, or Principle of the Reformation then the Holy Scripture. In effect, the Scripture is the Word of God, the Law of our Soveraign Lord, according to which we muſt all be Judged Paſtors and People, great and ſmall, Learned and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. It contains the Foundations of Divine Revelation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is neither Faith, nor a good Conſcience, nor peace of mind, nor hope of Salvation, and if they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things a little more carefully then they ordinarily do, I am perſwaded they would make no Difference with us about this Article. All Chriſtians are agreed that the Word of God is the only ſource of all the Myſteries that are neceſſary to our belief in Order to our Salvation; and that his will, is the only Rule of our Worſhip. This is a Maxim about which there is no diſpute between us and thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for they know with us, that <hi>Faith comes out of the Word of God, and that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>it is in vain to Honour God, when we follow the Commandments of men.</hi> All our difference conſiſts but in the knowing where that word and that will is; we reſtrain it to the Scripture, our Adverſaries extend it further; for they would have it to be found in <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> in the writings of the Fathers, in the deciſions of the <hi>Popes,</hi> in the Determinations of the Councils, and in all that which they call the belief of the Church, not only while thoſe things are conformable to the Scripture, but alſo while they are beſides the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But as for the deciſions of the <hi>Popes</hi> and Councils, our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries themſelves conſeſs, that God gives them not any new and immediate Revelation, that diſcovers new Objects of Faith to them, or new ways of Worſhip, and that ſince Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, God has not given the like Revelations to men, either in theſe latter or the proceeding Ages. <hi>It is certain,</hi> ſays Monſieur <hi>du Val,</hi> his words being ſet down by Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi>

               <p>It is therefore an unqueſtionable Truth, that there is no new and immediate Revelation in the Church, and that Revelation ceaſed in Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles. From whence it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows, that all that is to be found, either in the deciſions of the <hi>Popes,</hi> or in the Definitions of the Councils, or in the Writings of the Fathers, or the belief of the Church, or in that which they call <hi>Tradition,</hi> or in a word, in all that proceeds from the Mouth and hands of men, whatſoever Denomination they may paſs under, is the word of God, but as far as it may be found conformable to that Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>But that being ſo, as it is without any difficulty, how can they be certain of that Conformity, but as they refer to and compare things with the Scripture? They ſay, that there are certain Articles of that Revelation, which the Apoſtles have delivered down in Truſt from their own living voice, alone to their Succeſſors, and which from hand to hand have came down to us. But beſides that that very thing is a matter of Hiſtory, about which we cannot have any certainty of Faith, and upon which by Conſequence we can build nothing firmly, what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign can they give us to know thoſe pretended Apoſtolical <hi>Traditions</hi> by, or to diſcern the True by, when they ſhould be mingled with the falſe?

                     </gap>llenaries</hi> to be leſs falſe, which divers Antient Fathers have approved and maintained as a <hi>Tradition</hi> proceeding from the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>The Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> who have the Feaſt of Eaſter Celebrated preciſely on the Fourteenth Day of the <hi>Moons Age</hi> after the Vernal <hi>Equinox,</hi> boaſt for that purpoſe of the <hi>Tradition</hi> of Saint <hi>John,</hi> and Saint <hi>Philip;</hi> and the reſt of the Church, hold on the contrary by Apoſtolical Tradition that it ought to be Celebrated on the Sunday of our Lord's Reſurrection. The <hi>Greeks, Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Abaſſines, Latins, Armenians</hi> have their contrary <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> for <hi>Tradition</hi> changes its Face and Form, according as the Nation changes; one ſort hold for a <hi>Tradition,</hi> the neceſſity of three immerſions in Baptiſm, and that of the uſe of Leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bread in the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> and the other mock at it and reject it. The one ſort believe a <hi>Purgatory</hi> by <hi>Tradition,</hi> the others believe it not.

Who can ſay Juſtly in ſo great a Confuſion, which this is Apoſtolical, and this is not ſo?</p>
               <p>Moreover, there are a great many Antient <hi>Traditions,</hi> which publick uſe heretofore Authoriſed, and which Time has ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; that there remains not the leaſt ſhadow of them among the <hi>Latins,</hi> as that of not Baptizing, without a Caſe of neceſſity but only at the Solemn Feaſts of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> of giving of Milk and Honey to the Baptized, of Adminiſtring the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> to little Children after Baptiſm, of Praying ſtanding upon the Lords day, and from <hi>Eaſter</hi> till <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the Communion on the Evening of Faſt-days, of every
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:97749:138"/>
ones carrying home with him a piece of the Bread of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, of diſtributing the Cup to all the faithful Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, of receiving the Communion not on ones Knees, but ſtanding, of mutually kiſſing one another before the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and divers others, which the <hi>Latins</hi> have Abrogated. On the other ſide, how many <hi>Latin Traditions</hi> are there which the uſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Authoriſes at this Day, of which we cannot find the leaſt Trace in the Primitive Church, and which from thence viſibly diſcover themſelves to be New, and by conſequence falſe, and not Apoſtolical, as the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images, Invocation of Saints, Tranſubſtantiation, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of the Hoſt. Uſe of Altars, that of Lights or Tapers, <hi>Maſſes</hi> without any Communion, the Divine Service in a Tongue not underſtood by the People, the Soveraign Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> over all other Churches, Auricular Confeſſion, the Number of the ſeven Sacraments, and as many more, that the Primitive Church which came neareſt to the Apoſtles never knew, as we have often Juſtified, from whence it follows, that they are not Apoſtolical, and deſcending from that only and laſt Revelation without which there is no word of God. There is therefore nothing more improper to be the Rule of Faith then that pretended <hi>Tradition,</hi> which is not eſtabliſhed upon any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Foundation, which ſerves for a pretence to Hereticks, which is embraced <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> which changes according as times and places do, and by the favour of which they may defend the greateſt abſurdiries, by meerly ſaying that they are the <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> which the Apoſtles Tranſmitted from their own Mouths to their Succeſſours.</p>
               <p>In a word, if they would have us to believe a Myſtery with a Divine Faith, if they would that we ſhould practiſe a Worſhip with a perſwaſion that it is agreeable to God, they ought to ſhew us that that Myſtery, and that Worſhip proceeds from the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles; for without that, all that is in the World is of Men's Invention, ſince after Chriſt and his Apoſtles there has been no <hi>Revelation,</hi> as we are both agreed. But they can only ſhew us that by theſe two ways, either by that of the Scripture in ſhewing us that thoſe Myſteries, and that Worſhip are conformable to it, or by that of Tranſmiſſion <hi>viva voce.</hi> But as to that Tranſmiſſion <hi>viva voce,</hi> we are ſo far from being able to have a Divine certainty, that we can't have
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:97749:138"/>
ſo much as a humane, for the Reaſons which I have alleadged. Which are, that from the beginning of Chriſtianity, Hereticks have boaſted of them, and yet they were not believed for them; that the Orthodox themſelves, were deceived in them, alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in falſe and vain things, which the following Ages have rejected; that the Schiſmatical Churches alledge them againſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> and the <hi>Latins</hi> againſt the Schiſmaticks, without one ſides having any better ground then the other; that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſets them before us for thoſe New things, which the firſt Ages never knew. It remains therefore that the way of the Conformity to the Scripture, upon which we are all agreed, is that in which the Divine <hi>Revelation</hi> is contained.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt <hi>this way of the Scripture,</hi> according to the Author of the Prejudices, <hi>is Infinite, Ridiculous, Impoſſible, it has ſuch conſuſions and length that we cannot come to the end of it, with all our diligence. The Principle of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> ſays he, <hi>includes all theſe Maxims without which it cannot ſubſiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>That the Church is not infallible in its deciſions concerning the Faith.</hi> 2. <hi>That Traditions do not make any part of the Rule of the Faith.</hi> 3. <hi>That the Scripture contains in general all the points of Faith, and ſo that whatſoever is not contained in the Scripture, cannot be of Faith.</hi> 4. <hi>That it contains them clearly, and after a manner that is fitted to the under standing of all the World. So that the certainty of that way, and the hope that we can rationally conceive of it must depend upon the certainty of theſe Maxims.</hi> Upon that, we muſt note, that it is not here Queſtioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scripture be Divine or not, but that ſuppoſing that it is ſo, he ſays only, <hi>That he muſt demand of us thoſe formal and deciſive paſſages that prove thoſe four Propoſitions.</hi> And that, when we do propoſe any one, we muſt firſt be aſſured that it is taken out of a Canonical Book, and to that effect, we muſt examine the controverſy of the Canonical Books, and ſee by what Rules they may be known. 2. We muſt be certain that that paſſage is conformable to the Original, and to that effect, we muſt conſult the Originals. 3. We muſt be certain that there are not different ways of Reading it, that may weaken the proof. 4. That we muſt narrowly ſee into the ſence of the paſſage, not to give it too great a Latitude, nor to blind our ſelves with an appearance. 5. That we muſt ſee whether there are no expreſſions, or contrary paſſages, which force us to take the paſſage in another ſence. 6. That we ought to conſult the Interpreters of one ſide and of the other, and to know what they ſay upon that paſſage. 7. That after this, we muſt come to the diſtinction of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points, and thoſe that are not Fundamental and prove it by Scripture. 8. That we muſt examine the paſſages which
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:97749:139"/>
each Sect produces in its Favour. 9. That laſtly, after all this, it is neceſſary that a man ſhould truſt his own Eyes and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which failing to go through all the former reaſons, and preſerving only a conſuſed <hi>Idea</hi> of them, will not further allow him to make a Juſt Judgment of things. He concludes from thence, that this way is not only interrupted with unconquerable difficulties and obſtacles; but that it is of a length ſo little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to mens minds, that it is evident that it cannot be that which God has choſen to inſtruct us in the Truths by which he would lead us to Salvation. <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>if they themſelves who make a profeſſion of ſpending all their lives in the Study of Divinity, ought to Judge that Examination to be above their abilities, what will become of thoſe who are obliged to ſpend the greateſt part of their Time in other Occupations? What will become of Judges, Magiſtrates, Tradeſmen, Labourers, Souldiers, Women, Children, who have as yet a very weak Judgment? What will become of thoſe who do not underſtand ſo much as any of the Languages into the which the Bible is Tranſlated? What will become of the blind who know not how to Read? What will become of thoſe who have no underſtanding, nor any readineſs of mind? How can all thoſe People examine all thoſe Points, the Diſcuſſion of the least of which notwithſtanding, is evidently neceſſary to make them rationally determine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is eaſy to ſee that all that heap of Objections and Difficulties which the Author of the Prejudices has propoſed againſt the way of the Scripture, tends only to lead men to the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the end they ſhould ſubject themſelves to that as a Soveraign and Infallible Rule. But as the Doctrine of the Soveraign Authority of that Church is not one of thoſe firſt Principles which the light of Nature dictates to all men, ſince of Thirty parts of our known World, there are at leaſt nine and twenty who do not acknowledge it, and as they cannot alſo ſay, that it is one of the firſt and common notions of Chriſtianity, ſince of all thoſe who profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, there are Three parts which reject it, The Author, may freely give us leave if he pleaſes, that we ſhould firſt demand of him upon what Foundation he would build that Doctrine, to make us receive it, as a point of Divine Faith? I ſay of Divine Faith; for if we ſhould hold it only as a matter of human Faith, he himſelf would ſee well that we could not believe the things which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould teach, in vertue of its Authority, otherwiſe then with a humane Faith, ſince the things which depend upon a principle,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:97749:140"/>
cannot make an impreſſion in us different from that which the principle has made. To the end therefore that I ſhould believe with a Divine Faith that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall teach me by its Authority, it is neceſſary that I ſhould alſo believe its Authority with a Divine Faith. Thus far methinks we ſhould not have any Controverſy.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee therefore upon what Foundations of Divine Faith he would pretend to eſtabliſh this Propoſition, <hi>The Authority of the Church of Rome is Soveraign and Infallible:</hi> He can only do it by theſe Three ways: The firſt is, by a new Revelation that God ſhould have made to us of this Truth; the Second, in ſhewing that it is one of the Articles that is contained in the Revelation of the Apoſtles; and the Third, in ſhewing us the Characters of Divinity and Infallibility impreſſed upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> even after the ſame manner as every thing proves it ſelf by the marks that diſtinguiſh it; and thus it is that we pretend that the Scripture forces the acknowledgment of its own Divinity. The firſt of theſe ways is nullified, ſince they agree with us that ſince Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles there has been no new Revelation, and that there muſt not be any expected. The ſecond would be proper, and neceſſarily ſuppoſes a recourſe either to <hi>Tradition</hi> or the Scripture; for there are but theſe two Channels in which we can ſeek for the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Apoſtles. But that of the Scripture is forbidden us by the Author of the Prejudices, by reaſon of the unconquerable difficulties which he diſcovers there. <hi>It is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a way full of obſtacles and difficulties, and even thoſe who profeſs to ſpend all their days in the Study of Divinity, ought to judge that Examination to be above all their abilities.</hi> He muſt therefore content himſelf with the way of <hi>Tradition.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can make uſe of that, he muſt be firſt aſſured, and that with a certainty of Divine Faith, that that which that <hi>Tradition</hi> contains is come down from the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or at leaſt, that this particular point of the Authority of the Roman <hi>Church,</hi> in the ſtate wherein it is at preſent, muſt have proceeded from thence, that the Apoſtles muſt have Tranſmitted it <hi>viva voce</hi> down to their Succeſſours, and that their Succeſſours muſt have received it and Tranſmitted it down to thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from them in the ſame ſence, and every whit the ſame, as the Apoſtles had given it to them. If he cannot be aſſured of that Tranſmiſſion, all that he would build upon it will be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and if he cannot be aſſured of it with a Divine Faith, that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:97749:140"/>
which he would build upon it will not be more ſo. But how can he be aſſur'd of that? He has no more that living Voice of the Apoſtles to repreſent it to us, he muſt rely upon Teſtimonyes; would it therefore be the <hi>Roman</hi> Church that muſt aſſure us? But her Divine and Infallible Authority is as yet in Queſtion, and while it ſhall be queſtioned, it remains ſuſpended, it cannot be believed any further then with a humane Faith. Shall it be the Scripture that muſt give Teſtimony to that Tradition? But <hi>there are ſo many Difficulties in that way,</hi> ſays the Author of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, That it is <hi>Evident that it is not that which God has choſen to Inſtruct us in his Truths.</hi> Muſt we learn it from that Tradition it ſelf? But to decide that point, whether that Tradition came from the Apoſtles or no, Tradition it ſelf can be yet no other than a humane Teſtimony. I mean that the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles declare to us that they have received ſuch and ſuch Doctrines from the Apoſtles <hi>viva voce,</hi> and that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them in the ſame ſence in which the Apoſtles gave them to them, we cannot at the moſt have more then a humane Faith for them, for they are men as well as others. Hitherto therefore there cannot be had a Divine Faith concerning the point of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and Infallible Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and nothing, by Conſequence, that can aſſure the Conſcience, and ſet the mind of man at reſt.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore paſs over to the third means, which is that of examining the Characters of Divinity and Infallibility, that may be ſeen in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. It is, in my Judgment, in the ſight of this, that they give us certain external Marks, and we have already ſeen that the Author of the Prejudices eſtabliſhes upon this, that Authority about which we diſpute. <hi>The moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In his Preface,</note> 
                  <hi>Authority,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that can be in the world, is eaſily diſcover'd to be in the Catholick Church, becauſe though there are Sects that diſpute with it the Truth of its Tenets, yet there are none that can with any Colour contend with it for that eminence of Authority which ariſes from its External Marks.</hi> But without entring here far into the Controverſy touching thoſe Marks, I ſay, that he is very far from being able to eſtabliſh ſuch a certainty upon them as we ought to have of a Principle of Religion. And this will appear from theſe three Reaſons: The Firſt is, That the greateſt part of thoſe marks are common to falſe Societies, and even to Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Churches, which not only are not Infallible, but which are actually in Errour, as I have ſhewn in the firſt part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97749:141"/>
The Greek Church, for example, in its greateſt conteſts with the <hi>Latin,</hi> was always a Catholick Church, ſhe was of as great Antiquity as the <hi>Roman,</hi> ſhe had an uninterrupted duration from many Ages ago, ſhe had her large extent, and her multitude, as well as the <hi>Roman,</hi> ſhe had a Perſonal Succeſſion of her Biſhops down from the Apoſtles, ſhe gloried in a Conformity to the Doctrine of the Fathers, ſhe had her members united among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and with her Patriarchs, ſhe did no leſs then the <hi>Roman,</hi> affirm her Doctrine to be Holy, and her word to be Efficacious, and that her Authors were holy men; ſhe has yet at this day her Miracles, which ſhe boaſts of, ſhe had her Prophets and Temporal Proſperity; in a word ſhe might propound all that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alleadges. The <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Church on her ſide, may do it as much, and yet nevertheleſs thoſe Marks no ways conclude a Soveraign and Infallible Authority for them, they do not therefore conclude it for the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. The Second Reaſon is, that of all thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended marks, ſome are diſputed with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> others are fallaciouſly attributed to it, and others conclude nothing leſs then that which they pretend. We diſpute with her, her Conformity to the Fathers, the Unity of her Members between themſelves and with their Head, the Holineſs of her Doctrine, and the Efficacy of her Word. It is true that ſhe boaſts of theſe advantages; but if we ſhould come to examine them, we ſhould find they would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Solidity in them, ſhe fallaciouſly aſcribes to her ſelf the name of the Catholick; The Antiquity and Holineſs of her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, Miracles, Prophecy, and the Perſonal Succeſſion of her Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; For before they can make any advantage of thoſe marks, they ought to ſhew that ſhe is a Catholick not only in name, but in deed, that ſhe has chang'd nothing in the Antient Doctrine, nor in the Antient worſhip, that ſhe has in nothing degenerated from her firſt Authors, that ſhe is conformable to her firſt Chriſtians, whoſe Miracles and Prophecys are beyond all queſtion, that her Biſhops are the Succeſſors of the Mind and Doctrine, as well as of the Sees of the Antient Biſhops; and unleſs they do ſo, thoſe marks are an Illuſion. She produces others, which conclude no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs then that which ſhe ſhould conclude, as the Multitude of her Children, or the largeneſs of her extent, and Temporal Proſperity; which are wordly advantages more proper to denote a corruption, then an Infallibility. The third Reaſon is, That there are contrary Characters in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which note, not only, that ſhe has been, and that ſhe is yet ſubject to err;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:97749:141"/>
but that ſhe has actually err'd, and we have propos'd ſome in the beginning of this Treatiſe, which it may be, deſerve to be better conſider'd. No man can therefore eſtabliſh any thing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty upon thoſe pretended external marks; and in general that principle of the Soveraign and Infallible Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be a matter of divine Faith, on which ſide ſoever he takes it, nor by Conſequence can any of thoſe things be ſo, which depend upon that Authority. See here then the Obligation which lies upon thoſe in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion to the Author of the Prejudices, for having thus Aboliſh'd all manner of Divine Faith, for thoſe things which that Church teaches by her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in ſhutting up, as he has done, the way of the Scripture, with his <hi>Obſtacles, and unconquerable Difficulties,</hi> he has reduc'd all to meer Conjectures, or almoſt all, to humane Teſtimonies. Is it therefore after that manner that he would have us believe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, the Real preſence, Purgatory, The Sacrifice of the Maſs? Is it upon the Foundations of that nature that he would have us to Invocate Saints, that we ſhould worſhip Images, That we ſhould adore the Hoſt, and receive the Indulgences of the Pope, and Abſolutions of their Confeſſors? But he has done yet worſe; for it is not only the Laity and private men from whom he has taken away a divine Faith, he has torn it away even from the whole Body of his Church, from her Prelats, her Popes, and her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, ſince if this Point of their Soveraign and Infallible Authority is founded upon nothing but Conjectures and humane Teſtimonies, They can neither have a Divine Faith for thoſe Conjectures and thoſe humane Teſtimonies, nor for all thoſe other things which depend upon them. Have they a Revelation, an immediate Illumination that inſtructs them? There is no more either for the Popes or Councils. Should they have it from the Scripture? The Author of the Prejudices has told them, that it is an <hi>Infinite, a Ridiculous way, to Inſtruct men in the Truth, a path which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know how to find an end of, whatſoever Diligence we uſe.</hi> But it may be he ſays that only for the Laity, and not for the Clergy. Let us ſee his words: <hi>Even thoſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who profeſs to ſpend their whole Lives in the Study of Divinity, ought to judge that Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be above all their Abilities.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Body of her Prelats, the Councils, cannot at furtheſt but be made up of thoſe men, who profeſs to ſpend their whole Lives in the Study of Divinity, and that Examination is above all their Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He ought not to ſay that they can altogether do that which
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:97749:142"/>
it would be impoſſible for each one to do in particular. For when they go about to decide the matters of Faith by their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Authority, as they pretend that Councils ſhould do, each particular man ought to be aſſured by himſelf of the Truth, and not to refer himſelf to the knowledge of his Brethren. With what Conſcience therefore can they exerciſe their Authority? With what Conſcience can they decide the points of the Faith, and propoſe them to be believed as points of a Divine Faith? With what Conſcience can they retain men in their Dependance? And with what Conſcience can men remain therein?</p>
               <p>The Author of the Prejudices may diſintangle this Buſineſs with his Church as it ſhall pleaſe him, we have no peculiar Intereſt in it, but only to let him ſee more and more, the Truth of that which I have ſaid elſewhere, that he does not ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he has wrote. Let us grant him, that there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a Divine Faith for the eſtabliſhing of that Article of the Soveraign and Infallible Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, let us yield, if he will have it ſo, that he may be contented with the having a humane certainty, ſuch as he may have; it is clear, that whether he takes the way of Tradition, or that of the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the External marks, we ſhall find the ſame Difficulties there, theſ me Obſtacles, the ſame Hindrances, the ſame length, that the Author of the Prejudices pretends to have diſcovered in the way of the Scripture; And as the External Marks themſelves cannot be otherwiſe juſtified then by Tradition, it ſhall ſuffice to ſhew what I have ſaid in the way of Tradition; for all will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to that.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, it is certain that we ought not to take all ſorts of Traditions to be true, indifferently, ſince we have already ſeen that there are ſome falſe and Apocryphal; ſo that we muſt learn plainly to diſtinguiſh it by it ſelf, the good and the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick from the others, and to that effect to know certainly the rules by which we ought to make that diſtinction, always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not here of any uſe, becauſe it is in queſtion, and that it is that Authority which we are treating of in that ſearch. See here already a no ſmall Confuſion; for we muſt, for this, turn over a great many Books, be well read in Hiſtories, Paſs a great many Judgments, which cannot be very eaſy to a man who will not help himſelf with the Authority of the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After we have ſet aſide Apocryphal Tradition, and it being
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:97749:142"/>
reſtrained to the True, we muſt enter upon the Examination of the queſtion that is controverted, to wit, Whether the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it pretends at this day, be taught in that Tradition? And to this effect, he muſt ſee whether the Paſſages that are brought to prove it, are faithfully related, and for that he muſt conſult the Originals, and compare them with the Tranſlations, which require a great knowledge of the Tongues, or at leaſt as the Author of the Prejudices ſays, that one ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr himſelf to a ſufficient number of fit perſons, to have no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to doubt of the Fidelity of their Relations. And as the number of Antient Books is not ſmall, that Conſultation could not but be long enough.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He muſt not forget alſo to inquire, whether there be not diverſe ways of reading the Paſſages that may weaken that proof. For ſince the Author of the Prejudices would have us obſerve this Precaution to aſſure our ſelves of one only paſſage of Scripture, why would he not have it obſerved to aſſure himſelf of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of that Tradition? It will therefore be neceſſary to conſult the Manuſcripts of Libraries, or at leaſt, to read the notes which the Criticks have made upon the Books out of which thoſe Paſſages ſhall be taken; this would be yet a matter of further Labour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But muſt he not alſo be bound to examine narrowly the meaning of the Paſſages, not to give them too great a Latitude, and avoid being blinded with a meer Appearance? For if there are in the Scripture, as the Author of the Prejudices aſſures us, that the <hi>Paſſages that appear clearly to Contain certain Truths, and which do not in Effect contain them, are an occaſion of deluding thoſe who are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 14. pag. 341.</note> 
                  <hi>too eaſily led by that Appearance which at firſt ſight preſents it ſelf.</hi> Why muſt it not be ſo in Tradition alſo? They ordinarily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge that Paſſage of Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in Favour of the particular Church of <hi>Rome, Ad haue Eccleſiam propter.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:97749:143"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of the Imperial power which drew all the World thither, and that from thence it was that they all together pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Doctrine that the Apoſtles had left, without their having any conſiderable difference between them. That this was the meaning of Saint <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> appears from the Connexion of his diſcourſe, wherein he propoſes to prove that the Pretended Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Hereticks could not come from the Apoſtles, and his reaſon is, that if they could have come from them, they would have been yet found in his Time in the Churches which they had inſtituted, and particularly in the <hi>Roman,</hi> which was in a manner an Abridgment and Compoſition of all others, by reaſon of the concourſe of all Nations to <hi>Rome.</hi> So that to ſhew that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe times did not own any of the Tenets of thoſe Hereticks, was at once to ſhew that they were Traditions unknown to all the Churches, and by Conſequence falſe and not Apoſtolical. This Example therefore ſhews us that one ought not to let himſelf be dazzled by the firſt Appearances of a Paſſage; but that it ought to be narrowly examined, and that, as every one may ſee, requires time, and is not altogether ſo eaſy to be done.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To carry on that Examination well, in reſpect of the Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Scripture, the Author of the Prejudices would that we ſhould carefully conſider the like Expreſſions and contrary Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, to ſee whether we ſhould not be bound by them to give another meaning to thoſe Paſſages which we gather. He ſays, <hi>That Common Senſe dictates this Rule, and that it is full of Equity and Juſtice.</hi> I ſee not therefore how he can exempt his <hi>Catechumeni</hi> from it, in regard of the Paſſages of Tradition. It is requiſite that he ſhould carefully remark the ways of ſpeaking in the Fathers, in diverſe matters, in order to the making them mutually give light to one another. It is neceſſary, that he ſhould look after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Paſſages of the Antients, and that he compare them one with another, to draw out clear Obſervations from them. But this will be yet further no ſmall Buſineſs; for it is very well known that there are things enough in the Antients directly oppoſite to the Pretenſions of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But not to detain the Readers much longer upon ſo clear a matter, all the Intricate Perplexity which he pretends to find in the way of the Scripture, f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lls back again upon the way of Tradition, when they would by this, without the aid of the Scripture, be fully ſatisfied concerning the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> It
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:97749:143"/>
is neceſſary to diſcern a true Tradition from a falſe one; It is neceſſary to conſult the Originals; It is neceſſary to know the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ways of reading paſſages; It is neceſſary to ſearch out the meaning with great Attentiveneſs; It is neceſſary to examine the like Expreſſions, and contrary Paſſages; It is neceſſary to ſee divers Interpretations of both ſides; It is neceſſary to know why the <hi>Roman</hi> Church diſtinguiſhes between points which every Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man is bound to believe with a diſtinct Faith, and thoſe which it is enough to believe upon the Faith of the Church; It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Examine that, which each Sect that does not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ſays againſt her; And after all that, it is neceſſary that every one ſhould miſtruſt his own Eyes, and the defects of his memory, and that he ſhould be always recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting his firſt thoughts to keep himſelf from paſſing a wrong Judgment.</p>
               <p>In fine, we will alſo demand of the Author of the Prejudices whether he would not give the Scripture this Honour, to reckon it for one part of <hi>Tradition,</hi> ſince it contains the firſt Sermons of the Apoſtles, from whence we may draw a great deal of light for the deciding of the <hi>Queſtion</hi> upon which we are, which is that of the Authority and Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> For how can any man rationally determine himſelf, upon a point of that weight, without conſulting the firſt and the moſt Antient piece of <hi>Tradition?</hi> But that being ſo, we ſee here how we are fallen back into the difficulties and perplexities which the Author of the Prejudices pretends to be unconquerable. And as thoſe Gentlemen are liable enough to be beaten with their own Weapons, we will only turn againſt him the concluſions that he pretends to draw againſt us from his Principles, and demand of him, <hi>Whether he believes this way very proper for thoſe who are Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſpend the greateſt part of their time in other Employments? Whether he believes it proper for Judges, Magiſtrats, Tradeſmen, Labourers, Souldiers, Women, Children, for thoſe who do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any of the Languages into which the Fathers are Tranſlated, for the Blind who cannot Read, and for thoſe who have no quickneſs of underſtanding?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I only propounded to my ſelf to refute this Author, I might content my ſelf with what I have ſaid, and wait with patience for what he ſhould have to propoſe, to diſintangle his <hi>Catechumeni</hi> from the Difficulties and lengths whereinto he himſelf has plunged them. But becauſe I deſire alſo to ſatisfy mens Con-
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:97749:144"/>Conſciences,
I think my ſelf bound to Anſwer directly to his Objections. Let us therefore ſee thoſe four Maxims, which he ſays, our Principle includes, and without which he is certain it cannot ſubſiſt. As to the firſt, we ſhall tell him, that it does not belong to us, to lay down the proofs of this Propoſition, <hi>That the Church of Rome</hi> (for this is that we are about) <hi>is not infallible in her deciſions concerning the Faith,</hi> ſhe is naturally ſubject to be deceived; if ſhe pretends to have a priviledge that exempts her from a weakneſs common to all men, it belongs to her to ſhew it, and to convince the world of it; but till then we ſhall always have a ground to preſume that ſhe is ſubject to that general Law, and that is ſufficient, without any other proof, to hinder us from acknowledging her for the Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p>As to the Second, which is, <hi>That Traditions do not make up any part of the Rule of Faith;</hi> we ſhall tell him, That it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily incumbent on us to bring a paſſage of Scripture to exclude <hi>Traditions,</hi> that Common ſence is enough for that, becauſe it dictates to all men, even to the moſt ſimple, if they would take heed, that after ſixteen hundred years, or thereabouts, which are gone ſince the Apoſtles days, <hi>Tradition</hi> cannot but be a very confuſed and uncertain thing; and that being ſo vagous as it is, after its having paſſed through the hands of an infinite number of men, naturally unſetled and changeable, it is not imaginable that they ſhould not have altered, increaſed, leſſened it, ſince that happens through a long tract of Time to all other things; and by conſequence, that it could not at preſent but be out of a condition to ſerve for a Rule of Faith. Thus far the moſt ſimple are within the limits of nature and general Experience. If they pretend that <hi>Tradition</hi> ought to be exempted, it does not belong to us to ſhew that it is not, it is their part who make that pretenſion to produce their Reaſons; and yet for all that, it muſt be preſumed on the ſide of Nature, and general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
               <p>It appears therefore already, that the Two Firſt Propoſitions which our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> includes, according to the Author of the Prejudices, to wit, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is not Infallible in its deciſions concerning the Faith; and that</hi> Traditions <hi>do not make up any part of the Rule of Faith,</hi> do not give us the leaſt difficulty, but they give an infinite one to our adverſaries. For they ought ſolidly to prove the contrary Propoſitions, not only to the Learnned, and knowing perſons; but to the moſt ſimple alſo,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:97749:144"/>
to Tradeſmen, to Labourers, to Souldiers, to Women, and generally to all; or otherwiſe they abuſe their credulity; retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them without Reaſon and without Juſtice in their Communion, in which they cannot remain with a good Conſcience, unleſs they are aſſured of the Truth of theſe two Articles, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is Infallible in her deciſions of Faith, and that</hi> Traditions <hi>make up a part of the Rule of Faith.</hi> But how can thoſe people have that certainty?</p>
               <p>As for what reſpects the Third Propoſition, to wit, <hi>That the Scripture contains all the points of the Faith generally,</hi> it has no more need then the others, to be proved by paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is ſufficient to eſtabliſh it, to ſee, that we cannot be aſſured of the Faith either by the deciſions of the Church, or <hi>Tradition.</hi> For that thing it ſelf neceſſarily leads all Chriſtians to the Scripture alone, there being nothing beſides the deciſions of the Church, and <hi>Tradition,</hi> that can Diſpute a part with it.</p>
               <p>There remains therefore only the Fourth Propoſition, which is, <hi>That the Scriptures generally contain all the points of Faith, after a manner fitted to the underſtandings of all the World.</hi> But this propoſition ſo framed, is not ours, neither is it included in our <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> We only ſay, that that which the Scripture contains in a manner fitted to the underſtanding of all the World concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Faith and Manners, is ſufficient for Salvation, provided that moreover they have not Errors that hinder that effect. But there is no need of proving this propoſition by Texts of Scripture. It ſufficiently proves it ſelf, as well by the very nature of the things that the Scripture clearly Teaches, as by the light of common ſence and the firſt notions of the Conſcience. For thoſe firſt notions dictate to all Chriſtians, that although God be free in the diſpenſation of his Call, he is notwithſtanding in good earneſt towards all thoſe to whom his Call is addreſſed, and that there being among thoſe the weak as well as the ſtrong, the ſimple as well as the Learned, it muſt neceſſarily be concluded that he would render his Salvation inacceſſible, or impoſſible to the ſimpler ſort, provided that they ſeriouſly applyed themſelves to it according to their Call. The Author of the Prejudices him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acknowledges this Principle, and he calls it, <hi>a principle of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In his Preface.</hi> Page 11.</note> 
                  <hi>common ſence.</hi> He draws ill conſequences from it, but the True Conſequence that muſt be drawn is, Thoſe things which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture clearly Teaches, and after a manner fitted to all the World, are ſufficient to Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:97749:145"/>
The Author of the Prejudices may chuſe therefore, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall pleaſe him, other Propoſitions to exaggerate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended difficulties of the Scripture. But what choice ſoever he ſhould make, and what ſide ſoever he ſhould take, it is certain that thoſe <hi>unconquerable difficulties,</hi> which according to him render the way of the Scripture <hi>ridiculous and impoſſible</hi> to the ſimpler ſort, are nothing elſe but the Viſions and Dreams of Fancy, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, or would create changes; and that he can ſay nothing more vain and chimerical then that which he has diſplayed in the <hi>14th.</hi> and <hi>15th.</hi> Chapters.</p>
               <p>This is what will manifeſtly appear, if we conſider that the Scripture is the Rule of Faith two ways; for it is ſo either to form the Faith to a degree of perfection and compleatneſs, as much as a Man is capable of it in this Life; or to form it to a degree of meer ſufficiency for Salvation. In the former reſpect, it is the Rule of Faith, not only for the things which it clearly contains; but generally for all that which it contains, whether in expreſs Terms, or in equivalent, whether by near conſequences, or remote; in a word, after what manner ſoever it be. In the Second, it is the Rule of Faith meerly for the things that are Eſſential to Religion, which it clearly contains, and after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fitted to the underſtanding of all the World. To make a Juſt and Right uſe in the former reſpect, I confeſs that we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily go over a great many Obſtacles, and conquer a great many difficulties. We muſt weigh the words exactly, examine the Stile, conſider the Reaſons, compare it with like expreſſions, conſider the paſſages that ſeem contrary to it, penetrate into the true ſence of ambiguous and obſcure places, look to the connexions of the Diſcourſe, to the matter treated of, and to the end and deſign of him who ſpeaks. To this effect, it is neceſſary to know how to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books from the <hi>Canonical,</hi> to underſtand the Original Tongues, to Judge of the Tranſlations by, and even to conſult Interpreters. All that requires, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, a great deal of care, earneſt application, a great deal of ſtudy, and it is very true, that to acquit ones ſelf well of it, the whole life of a man is not too long. I ſhall even ſay, that it is too ſhort, and that humane abilities are too weak to exhauſt the Scripture, which is an infinite depth of Myſteries and Heavenly Truths; and therefore it is, that the Author of the Preface to the New Teſtament of <hi>Mons,</hi> has very well ſaid, that, <hi>we may always loſe our ſelves in the abyſſes of Learning and</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:97749:145"/>
                  <hi>Wiſdom, which we adore without being able to comprehend.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, it is our duty to advance in that knowledge as far as we can, and it would be but a very bad reaſon for diſpenſation in that Caſe, to alledge the lengths and difficulties of it; for however we cannot attain to an intire perfection, yet we may notwithſtanding make a conſiderable progreſs, and the more a man advances in that ſtudy, the more Joy and Comfort he has.</p>
               <p>But as to the Second way in which the Scripture is the Rule of the Faith, to wit, to form the Faith in a degree of meer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency for Salvation, through the Eſſential things which it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contains; in this regard I ſay, its uſe is freed from all thoſe lengths and all thoſe difficulties, and accomodated to the capacity of the meaneſt, requiring nothing elſe but good ſence and a good Conſcience, which God gives to the ſmalleſt of his Children. Firſt, There is no neceſſity for that, that a man ſhould ſtudy the Queſtion of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> and Canonical Books; for that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion which is neceſſary when they would penetrate into the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe things of the Scripture, which may be drawn from it by <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> conſequences, or by a narrow Examination of its terms, and the ſtructure of the diſcourſe, becauſe thoſe particular things do not carry ſo ſenſible a Character of their Divinity with them as the reſt; That Diſcuſſion I ſay, which is neceſſary in that Caſe, is not ſo when they reſtrain themſelves, as the ſimpler ſort do, to the eſſential things which the Scripture clearly Teaches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe things make themſelves ſenſibly to be owned to be Divine, and by conſequence Canonical, which is ſufficient for the certainty of their Faith, if they remain in that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They have no need either to conſult the Original Tongues, or the different ways of Reading, becauſe, that thoſe exact Obſervations which are neceſſary when we would make uſe of the Scripture in the firſt Degree, are not ſo, when they would in the Second. Imperfect Tranſlations ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe clear things that make up the Eſſence of Religion, and the different ways of Reading do not make any difference. Thoſe things are neither in one only paſſage, nor in one only Book, they are ſo abundantly ſpread over the whole body of the Scripture, that the faults of Tranſlators, or varieties of <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder us from finding them there. And if ſometimes it happens, that the boldneſs and unfaithfulneſs of a Tranſlator
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:97749:146"/>
ſhould go ſo far as on ſet purpoſe to falſify any place of Scripture, as <hi>Veron,</hi> has done not long ſince in reference to a paſſage in the Acts, which ſays, <hi>that the Apostles ſerved the Lord,</hi> and which <hi>Veron</hi> has Tranſlated, that, <hi>they ſaid Maſs in the Lord,</hi> or as the Authors of the Tranſlation of <hi>Mons</hi> have done, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted into that ſame paſſage, that the Apoſtles <hi>Sacrificed to the Lord;</hi> and another in the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> wherein Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſays that he truſted to be given to the faithful <hi>through their Prayers,</hi> where they have Tranſlated it, that he truſted he ſhould be given to them, <hi>through the merit of their Prayers;</hi> when that I ſay ſhould fall out, there would be found enough perſons in the Church, who would not fail to advertiſe the people of ſuch unfaithfulneſs, that they might take heed of them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I ſay, That it is not neceſſary that the ſimpler ſort ſhould conſult the interpreters of the Scripture, to aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of its true meaning; for the Objects of their Faith are ſo clearly explained there, they are laid down in ſo many places, they are ſo well connected with one another, they are there in ſuch a manner that provides ſo well for all that is neceſſary for the inſtruction of the mind, for the conſolation of the conſcience, and the Sanctification of the Soul, that with the Grace of God which accompanies them in his Elect, they have no need of any thing but their meer view to inſinuate and enter into their hearts, and to form therein a True Faith.</p>
               <p>To diſſipate in a few words all that the Authour of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices has ſet down in his <hi>14th.</hi> and <hi>15th.</hi> Chapters, I ſhall only tell him, that he can require but theſe four conditions in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Faith, to render them capable of forming a true and ſaving Faith even in the hearts of the moſt ſimple: The Firſt is, That they be ſufficient for the Salvation of the moſt ſimple; The Second, That they be fitted to their capacity; The Third, That they ſhould have a certainty great enough to form a true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in their Souls; and the Fourth, That they ſhould form a pure faith and free'd from all Damnable Errors. But all theſe conditions may be found in the Object we are ſpeaking of, which are clearly propounded in the Scripture. They are ſufficient for Salvation; For who will dare to deny that it is not ſufficient for the Salvation of the moſt ſimple, to know the Father, the Son and the Holy-Ghoſt, one only Eternal God, wholly perfect, the Creator and Preſerver of the World, the abſolute Diſpoſer of all events, the Soveraign Lord of all things, Author of all, Judge
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:97749:146"/>
of men and Angels, and to form an <hi>Idea</hi> which inſpires, in an infinite Degree, Reſpect, Love, Obedience, Truſt, Invocation, and acknowledgment of what we owe to him, and which makes up the Sole Object of our Religion? To know the profound miſery of man, his natural corruption, his ignorance, his ſin, his damnation, his impotency to get out of that miſery wherein he is, and to form an <hi>Idea</hi> that excites humility, horrour at his own ſtate, fear of Gods Judgments, and thoſe holy inquietudes of Conſcience which Jeſus Chriſt calls hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs. To know that Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God is our only Remedy, who out of love to us was made man, who dyed for our Salvation, who is riſen again, who is aſcended up into Heaven, who reigns there now over all things, who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds there before God for us, and who from his high Heaven ſheds abroad his Holy Spirit into the Souls of his faithful ones; and to have thoſe thoughts which make us run to him, to place all our hope in him, to do nothing that may diſpleaſe him; to do on the contrary all that he commands us, to imitate him, and to glorify him as he deſerves, as much as we are able. To know the mercy of God which pardons us our Sins through Jeſus Chriſt, which gives us Heaven, with all neceſſary graces to carry us thither, and to have Sentiments that carry us out to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to Confeſſion, to Prayer, to Thankfulneſs for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which he communicates to us, to patience in afflictions, to Truſt, to Charity as well towards God as toward our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to Juſtice, to Goodneſs, to Compaſſion towards thoſe who are in miſery, to forgive thoſe injuries that are done to us, and to hold a Religious and brotherly Society with thoſe who have the ſame Sentiments with our own. Who can doubt, but that theſe things well known and well practiſed, as we have laid them down, are not ſufficient to the Salvation of the moſt ſimple?</p>
               <p>But, ſays the Author of the Prejudices, It is not enough that theſe things ſhould be ſufficient for the Salvation of the moſt ſimple, it is further neceſſary for the quiet of their Conſciences, that they ſhould know that they are ſufficient. But they cannot know that, without ſcrupulouſly examining the Queſtion of the Fundamental points and the not Fundamental, which requires a long and difficult diſcuſſion. This Objection is vain, For if thoſe Articles which I have before ſet down in general, are alone ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Salvation of the moſt ſimple, it is impoſſible that a good Soul of that order, ſhould not underſtand their ſufficiency,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:97749:147"/>
ſince thoſe Objects ſatisfy all the juſt and natural deſires of the Conſcience. In effect, They make the moſt ſimple know the God whom they ought only to ſerve, they diſcover to them their own miſery, they mark out their Remedy, and the means of their delivery, they inſpire into them Piety, Holineſs, Juſtice, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Repentance, Conſolation in their Afflictions, and the hope of a life to come; and they furniſh them with neceſſary motives to the love of God and their Neighbour, which is the fulfilling of the Law or as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks <hi>the end of the Commandment.</hi> It is not therefore neceſſary to the eſtabliſhing the quiet of the Conſcience of a man, for him to enter upon the Queſtion of the Fundamental, and the not-Fundamental points, nor that he ſhould engage himſelf in the difficulties and diſtinctions that ſtudy, and Meditation might furniſh the Learned with on that Subject. That Peace is ſufficiently eſtabliſhed by the things themſelves which I have mentioned; and provided that one believes and practiſes them well, they will never fail to appeaſe the troubles of a Soul, and of ſetling in it a firm hope of its Salvation.</p>
               <p>But, ſays the Author of the Prejudices yet further, The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church and the <hi>Greek</hi> Church deny that all the Tenets neceſſary to Salvation ſhould be reſtrained to the things that are clearly contained in the Scripture, ſo that of neceſſity they muſt enter upon, enter into the Examination of this Point; <hi>for the Authority of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>well deſerves that we ſhould not without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, prefer the raſh affirmation of a Miniſter before it.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the Sentiment of a good Conſcience, which contents it ſelf with the things clearly contained in the Scripture, finding it ſelf upheld by theſe two Reflexions, the one, That God has not any more made the Souls of the meer ſimple, then thoſe of the moſt Learned to be deluded with the inventions of the humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, under the pretence of Tradition, or of the deciſion of the Church; and the other, That God has not made his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation inacceſſible to them, well deſerves to be prefered without any further Examination, before all the intereſted pretenſions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Prelates, and all the Superſtitious <hi>Reveries</hi> of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And after this manner it will not be neceſſary to enter into any diſpute upon that ſubject. They may diſpute of it as much as they pleaſe in the Schools, the ſimpler ſort need not do it, they are ſufficiently contented to hold to all that which they find to be clearly expreſſed in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore paſs on to the ſecond Condition, and ſee
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:97749:147"/>
whether thoſe things which I have noted are not clearly to be found in the Scripture, and that in a way fitted to the capacity of the moſt ſimple. But it is certain that they are to be found there, and that they are laid down with ſufficient Evidence, not to ſurpaſs the reach of their underſtandings, and that they are few enough for number, not to exceed the force of their memories.</p>
               <p>But the Author of the Prejudices, demands of us what clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we mean, when we ſay that all the things that are neceſſary to Salvation are clearly contained in the Scripture? <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, if <hi>Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>means ſuch a clearneſs, as will convince all well diſpoſed and ill-diſpoſed perſons, and that no prejudice can darken it, ſo that he acknowledges nothing neceſſary to Salvation but what is expreſſed in the Scripture in that manner to be neceſſary to Salvation, I will maintain to him that his propoſition is impious, that it manifeſtly tends to make Socinians and Arrians to be received into the Church, and almoſt all Hereticks, ſince it banniſhes out of the number of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Faith all the Tenets which thoſe Hereticks diſpute, and which they do not ſee in the Scripture.</hi> But it is not very difficult to ſatisfy that demand. I ſpeak of ſuch a clearneſs as will convince a ſincere perſon, who does not blind himſelf either by paſſion, or malice, or intereſt, or prejudice, but lets his Reaſon and his Conſcience act in good Earneſt. This is well near the Anſwer that the Author of the Prejudices would make, if we asked him the ſame Queſtion, touching the clearneſs which he pretends there is in Tradition, or in the infallible voice of the Church; for his Juſtice is ſo great, that he does never propoſe any difficulties of our Principle to us, which are not common to the Principle of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which by conſequence, he would not be bound to anſwer himſelf, as well as we. Notwithſtanding I ſhall tell him that he groſly deceives himſelf, if he imagins that we will only acknowledge thoſe things for Articles of Faith which are clearly contained in the Scripture. It is true, that we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them only for the Articles of Faith which are <hi>neceſſary to the Salvation of the moſt ſimple,</hi> does not hinder, but that other things which are contained in the Scripture with leſs evidence, may alſo be Articles of the Faith, although not abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; for all that which is in the Scripture, after what manner ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be contained there, is of Faith. He does not leſs deceive himſelf, if he imagins that although the Articles which the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Arrians</hi> and other Hereticks diſpute, were of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe which are not ſo clearly contained in the Scripture,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:97749:148"/>
and the knowledge of which is not abſolutely neceſſary to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſimple, yet that we ought to receive thoſe Hereticks into the Church. There is a great difference between ſimple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who do not conceive a Fundamental Truth otherwiſe then under a general notion, and indiſtinctly, without going any farther, and thoſe going ſo far as a diſtinct <hi>Idea</hi> of the Truth, expreſly deny it, and ſubſtitute a falſe and deceitful <hi>Idea</hi> in its place. The former may be in a State of Salvation, and ought to be received into the Church; whereas the ſecond ſort ought to be baniſhed, as perſons infected with a pernitious Error. A Peaſant may be made to believe in good earneſt that Jeſus Chriſt is God, and that the Father the Son and the Holy Ghoſt are but one only God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going any farther, becauſe he will not underſtand the terms of, Nature, Eſſence, Perſon, Hypoſtatical Union, and others that are made uſe of upon that ſubject, and he will alſo be ignorant of the ſubtil and frivolous diſtinctions of the Hereticks. Who can deny that ſuch a man holds the Truth under a General <hi>Idea?</hi> And who will not yet place a very great difference between him and a <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> who very well knowing what theſe Propoſitions mean, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is God by his Eſſence, The Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt are Three Perſons and one only Divine Nature,</hi> will deny them, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in their places theſe other Propoſitions, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is God only by the dignity of his Office, and Glory of his Exaltation; The Father, the Son, and the Holy-Ghoſt, being only ſo by Denomination.</hi> It would be a very hard caſe in my Judgment to exclude the former from the Church, but it would be a ſin to admit the latter; and this ſhews us, by the way, the falſhood of the reaſoning of the Author of the Prejudices.</p>
               <p>But we ought to reſume our diſcourſe. I ſay therefore the ſame thing of the Third condition as of the two Former, The things whereof we treat perſwade themſelves, and make themſeves to be perceived as true and Divine, as well by the weakeſt as the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. For although the weaker are not in a condition to render a Reaſon exactly of their perſwaſion, as a Learned man would do, yet notwithſtanding we muſt not doubt but they are rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded. A Tradeſman, a Peaſant, a Labourer, know not how to explain either the rules of right reaſoning, or the mediums that Logick affords to diſcover the faults of Sophiſtry or falſe reaſoning, and yet nevertheleſs, they do yet apprehend a juſt reaſoning, and reject a bad. It is the ſame thing of a good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and a falſe, the weaker ſort may receive the one and reject
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:97749:148"/>
the other, when it ſhall be preſented to them and they would make that diſcernment by the meer Judgment of their Conſciences though they ſhould not be capable of Explaining their Reaſons well. For there are two ways of being perſwaded of a Truth, and knowing a falſhood, the one is, by a ſimple apprehenſion, and the other by reflection; the firſt comes from a meer impreſſion of the Objects, that make themſelves to be diſcerned by their very nature; and the other comes from Meditation and Study, through the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of certain Rules. I confeſs that there is more confuſion in the firſt, but that has alſo ſometimes more force and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty then the Second.</p>
               <p>As for that which regards the Fourth Condition, which is, That the Faith ſhould be pure and free'd from every damnable Error; beſides that which I have ſaid that the meer ſentiment of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is enough for the weaker ſort to make them diſcern the good from the bad, and by Conſequence, to reject the falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that ſhall concern their Salvation; beſides that, I ſay, it is certain, that damnable Errors, that is to ſay, thoſe which are incompatible with a true and ſaving Faith, have a natural repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy with the Truths that are Eſſential to Religion, wherewith the ſimpler ſort are endowed; ſo that thoſe Truths alone are ſufficient for the rejection of Errors, without any abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that they ſhould have a greater ſtock of Learning. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, The principle of the Adoration of one only God, in the Souls of the weakes ſort in our Communion, is ſufficient to make them reject a Religious worſhip paid to Creatures, without their lying under a neceſſity of entring further into the Controverſy which we have with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon that ſubject. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of confidence in God alone, is ſufficient to make them reject invocation of Saints, and Angels, and a confidence in their merits. The principle of the one only Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt upon the croſs for the Expiation of our ſins, is ſufficient to make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject humane Satisfactions, Purgatory, and the Indulgences of the <hi>Pope.</hi> The Principle of the Mediation of one only Jeſus Chriſt is ſufficient to make them reject the Interceſſion of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. The Principle of the Truth of the humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt like unto us in all things except ſin, is ſufficient to make them reject the Real Preſence, Tranſubſtantiation, the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and the Adoration of the Hoſt. And that which is yet further conſiderable is, That as the Eſſential Truths of Religion are ſo linked with one another, that there is not any one, that
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:97749:149"/>
may not be, as I may ſo ſpeak, the Center of all the reſt, that is to ſay, which may not have references to all the reſt, and immediate connexions, and which all the others may not ſerve to prove and uphold, which makes out divers ways or manners of eſtabliſhing them in the minds of the moſt ſimple; even ſo thoſe Errors that are deſtructive, are ſo repugnant to thoſe Truths, that there is not any one which may not be oppoſed not only by all in general, but even almoſt by each one in particular, which ſhews that there are divers ways of overthrowing them and deſtroying them in the minds of the weakeſt, and when they ſhall eſcape one of thoſe ways, they will be ſufficiently overthrown by another. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Tranſubſtantiation which is repugnant to the ſincerity of God, is alſo repugnant to the Truth of the humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt, to the formation of his Body of the ſubſtance of the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> to the ſtate of that Glory wherein he is at preſent, to the Article of his Aſcenſion, and of his exiſtence in Heaven, to the manner in which he dwells in us, which is by his Spirit, and by our Faith, to the nature of that hunger and thirſt which we ſhould have for his fleſh and for his blood, which is Spiritual, to the Character of both the Sacraments, wherein there never is any Tranſubſtantiation made, and to the perpetual Order that God obſerved when he wrought Miracles, which was to lay them open to mens Eyes and Sences; ſo that when a man ſhould not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of perceiving any of thoſe repugnances, he would perceive the others which would produce the ſame effect, and which would be ſufficient to make him reject thoſe Errors.</p>
               <p>See here then all the Conditions, that are neceſſary for the forming of a True Faith even in the Souls of the moſt ſimple, behold them found in the Scripture, and by conſequence behold the Scripture remaining the Rule of Faith, in ſpight of all the endeavours of the Author of the Prejudices. It is in vain that he ſo ſtrongly oppoſes it, it will always be what God has made it, that is to ſay, the Fountain and only ſource of the Truth of Religion, or as St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>the Foundation and Pillar of our Faith,</hi> which only can give us quiet of mind, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iren.</hi> lib. 3. cap. 1.</note> peace of Conſcience. The Difficulties which the Author of the Prejudices forms againſt the Scripture, have theſe Three Characters; The one, That they may be turned againſt himſelf, that is to ſay, that as he has made them upon the ſubject of the Scripture, We may alſo make them upon the ſubject of <hi>Tradition</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which he would ſend us back; the other, That in regard of the Scripture they are null and to no purpoſe; and the Third, That in regard of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, they are ſolid and unconquerable; and this is what will appear, if what I have ſaid in this and in the foregoing Chapter be well Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WE ſhould certainly be the moſt ungrateful perſons in the World, if, after the favour that God has ſhewn us, in re-eſtabliſhing the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Goſpel in the midſt of us, we ſhould not think our ſelves bound to give him everlaſting Thanks. So great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious an advantage, highly calls for our reſentments, and that in enjoying it with delight, we ſhould pay our Acknowledgements to the Author of it. But what ground ſoever we ſhould have to rejoyce in God, we muſt notwithſtanding avow, that we ſhould be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97749:150"/>
very inſenſible in regard of others, if we could behold without an extream affliction, the miſery of ſo many men who voluntarily deprive themſelves of that good. Thoſe who are at preſent engaged in thoſe Errors and Superſtitions, from which it has pleaſed the Divine Goodneſs to deliver us, are our Brethren, by the External Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Name, and by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of one and the ſame Baptiſm; and how can we intirely rejoyce, while we ſee them in a ſtate which we believe to be ſo bad and ſo contrary to our common Calling? I know, that God only, who is the Lord of mens hearts and minds, can diſſipate that gloomy darkneſs which they are involved in, and that it is our Duty, to pour out our ardent and continual Prayers to him for his Grace for them; but we ought not to neglect humane methods, among which, that of juſtifying the Conduct of our Fathers in the ſubject of their Separation, is one of the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious: and as it is by that eſpecially that they labour to render us odious; ſo is to that, that I ſhall allow the ſequel of this Work.</p>
               <p>The Separation of our Fathers ought to be diſtinguiſh'd into three Degrees: the Firſt conſiſts in that which they have loudly pronounc'd againſt the Doctrines and Cuſtoms of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they judg'd to be contrary to Faith and Piety, and which they have formally renounced: the Second conſiſts in this, that they have forſook the External Communion of that Church, and thoſe of its party: and the Third, in that they have made other Aſſemblies than hers, and that they have rank't them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under another Form of Miniſtry. We have treated of the Firſt already, where we have ſhewn, the Juſtice and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Reformation which our Fathers made; the Third ſhall be ſpoken to in the Fourth Part, and this is deſigned to examine the Second. Our Inquiry therefore at preſent, will be to know, whether our Fathers in Reforming themſelves, ought to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelves from the other Party, who were not for a Reformation; or whether, notwithſtanding the Reformation, they ought yet to have abode with them in one and the ſame Communion, and to have liv'd in that reſpect as they did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. This is that which I pretend to make clear in this Third Part of this Work.</p>
               <p>To enter upon this buſineſs, I confeſs, that if we could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it as a certainty, That all Separation in matters of Religion is odious and Criminal, we ought to be the firſt in condemning
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97749:150"/>
the Actions of our Fathers, and that whatever averſion we ſhould have for the Errors and Abuſes which we ſee reigning in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ought to labour to bear them as patiently as it could be poſſible for us to do, in waiting till it ſhould pleaſe God to correct them, and notwithſtanding to enter into its Communion, and to live under its Miniſtry. But ſo far are we from being able to make a ſuppoſition of this nature, that on the contrary, there is nothing more certain, than this Truth, That as there are Unjuſt, Raſh and Schiſmatical Separations; ſo there may be alſo not only Juſt and Lawful ones, but Neceſſary and Indiſpenſable ones alſo. So the Primitive Chriſtians withdrew themſelves from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, after it had obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in its unbelief: and afterwards, the Orthodox in the firſt Centuries held no Communion with the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> nor with the <hi>Manichees;</hi> nor in general, with thoſe Hereticks who diſturb'd the Purity of the Goſpel with their Errors. Nay, when the <hi>Arians</hi> had even made themſelves Maſters of the Synods and Churches, there was an actual Separation made of a very great number of perſons, as well of the Body of the Clergy, as that of the People, who would not have any Communion with them, and who endur'd upon that account all ſorts of perſecutions. Therefore alſo it was that S. <hi>Hilary</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Poictiers</hi> earneſtly exhorted the Biſhops and the Orthodox people by a publick Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he addreſs'd to them. <hi>The Name of Peace,</hi> ſayes he to them, <hi>is indeed very ſpecious, and the meer appearance of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity has</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hilar. adv. Arianos.</note> 
                  <hi>ſomething ſplendid in it: But who knows not, that the Church and the Goſpel acknowledges no other Peace than that which comes from Jeſus Chriſt, that which he gave to his Apoſtles before the glory of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and that which he left in Truſt with them by his eternal Command when he was about to leave them. It is this peace which we have taken care to ſeek when it has been loſt, and to re-eſtabliſh, when it has been diſturbed; and to preſerve, after we have found it again. But the ſins of our Times, and the Miniſters or Fore-runners of Antichriſt, will not ſuffer us to be the Authors of ſo great a good; nor that we ſhould ſo much as partake of it. They have their Peace which they boaſt of, which is nothing elſe, but an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Impiety, while they carry themſelves not as the Biſhops of Jeſus Chriſt, but as the Prelates of Anti-Chriſt.</hi> And about the end of his Letter, <hi>I exhort you,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that you take heed of Anti-Chriſt. Be not deceived by a fooliſh love of Walls, nor reſpect the Church more on Roofs and in Houſes, nor ſtrive no more, on ſuch frivolous conſiderations for the Name of Peace. As for my</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97749:151"/>
                  <hi>ſelf, I find more certainty in the Mountains, in the Foreſts, in the Lakes, in Priſons, in Gulphs; for there it was that the Spirit of God anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Prophets. Separate therefore your ſelves from</hi> Auxentius, <hi>who is an Angel of Satan, an Enemy to Chriſt, an open Perſecutor, a Violator of the Faith, who made a deceitful Profeſſion of the Faith before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, in which he joyn'd Blaſphemy to that Deceit. Let him aſſemble as many Synods as he pleaſes againſt me, let him make me be declared a Heretick, as he has often already done, let him proſcribe me by Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority, let him ſtir up the wrath of the Great Men againſt me as much as he will, he can never be any other to me than a Devil, ſince he is an</hi> Arian. <hi>I ſhall never have peace, but with thoſe who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Decree of our</hi> Nicene <hi>Fathers, would anathematize the</hi> Arians, <hi>and acknowledge Jeſus Chriſt to be truly God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> alſo relates, that before the Synod of <hi>Seleucid,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiph. haereſ</hi> 73</note> wherein <hi>Arianiſm</hi> was eſtabliſh'd, many people who found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be under the Juriſdiction of <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops remained firm in the confeſſion of the True Faith, and ſet up other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops themſelves. And the Hiſtories of <hi>Socrates, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> may teach us, that while the <hi>Arians</hi> poſſeſs'd the Temples, and the Sees of the Churches, the Orthodox held their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies apart, in the Fields as well as in private Houſes.</p>
               <p>With the ſame Judgement S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> teaches, That Jeſus <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ambroſ. Comm. in Luc. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.</note> Chriſt alone is he from whom we ought never to ſeparate our ſelves, and to whom we ought to ſay, <hi>Lord, to whom ſhall we go, thou haſt the words of eternal life.</hi> That above all things, the Faith of a Church ought to be regarded, that we ought to hold it there if Jeſus Chriſt dwells there; but if a people may be found to be there who are Violaters of the Faith, or that an Heretical Paſtor has polluted that habitation, we ought to ſeparate our ſelves from the Communion of Hereticks, and to avoid all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with that Synagogue. That we ought to ſeparate our ſelves from every Church that rejects the true Faith, and does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the fundamentals of the Apoſtles Preaching, without fear leſt its Communion ſhould brand us with ſome note of Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs.</p>
               <p>There could not therefore be a more unreaſonable thing in the World, than to prepoſſeſs ones ſelf in general againſt all manner of Separation: for it is manifeſt, that the communion of men is no otherwiſe deſirable, than as it can conſiſt with the communion of God; and that when that of men ſhall be found to be directly oppoſite to the true ſervice of God and our own ſalvation, which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97749:151"/>
is the only End of a Religious Society, we ought no longer to heſitate about our Separation.</p>
               <p>But to make out this Truth yet a little more clear, we need but to ſet before their eyes what we have already ſaid in the Firſt Part, that the Church may be conſider'd either in reſpect of its Internal State, in as much as it is the Myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Society of the truly Faithful and the true Elect of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture of Hypocrites and the worldly, pure throughout as ſhe is in Gods ſight; or in reſpect of its External State, in as much as it is a Society, which in the profeſſion of one and the ſame Religion, includes a ſufficiently great number of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and worldly, who do not belong to the Myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt, nor are of the Church, but in appearance only. That Diſtinction is evident enough of it ſelf, not to need any proof, and our Adverſaries themſelves will not oppoſe it. But altho' they do not oppoſe that Diſtinction, yet they never fail of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding both thoſe reſpects. For when they ſpeak of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that God has made concerning the perpetual ſubſiſtence of his Church, where it would be juſt to refer them to the Church only, as made up of the Truly Faithful: ſince to ſpeak properly, God looks upon them alone as his true Church, they refer them to the Church, in as much as it is mixt with the worldly and hypocrites. And when the Conteſt is about eſtabliſhing the Duties to which a Religious Society engages us, where it would be juſt to conſider the Church as mingled with the good and the wicked, the faithful and the worldly, ſuch as it appears to us; they conſider it, as it is pure and without any mixture of Hypocrites, ſuch as it is in the eyes of God. We may ſay, that this confuſion is the ſource of all their Errors, and the foundation of all their Fallacies which they make on this matter.</p>
               <p>We ought therefore, in order to our judging aright of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, to repreſent this Diſtinction to our ſelves, and to form within our ſelves a juſt Idea of it. For in the firſt place, it is without all doubt, that we never ought to ſeparate our ſelves from the Communion of the truly Faithful, who alone are the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Myſtical Body. If ſuch a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould go ſo far as to break the Internal Bond of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which conſiſts in having the ſame Faith and Chriſtian Holineſs, we could not make it without ſeparating our ſelves at the ſame time from Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; and by conſequence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97749:152"/>
our ſelves of all hopes of ſalvation, ſince there is no Name under Heaven given by which men may be ſaved, but only that of Jeſus Chriſt. If it ſhould not go ſo far as to break the bond of Internal Communion, but only of the External, that is to ſay, no longer to acknowledge others for our Brethren and Members of the ſame Body, nor to frequent the ſame Aſſemblies with them, this is a True Schiſm, which offends againſt the Laws of Charity, and which the Authors ſhall eſpecially anſwer for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgement-ſeat of God. And ſuch were the Schiſms of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> the <hi>Luciferians</hi> and many others, which were founded meerly upon perſonal intereſts, or at leaſt upon light and frivolous pretences.</p>
               <p>It is further beyond doubt, that we ought not to break that External Communion which it has with the worldly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane that are mixt in a Religious Society, while they make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the true Faith, practiſing a ſincere Worſhip, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves to that Rule of Manners which the Goſpel layes down to us, although otherwiſe their Lives and Actions ſhould very ill anſwer their Profeſſion. I confeſs, that every Church well ordered, ought to have its Laws for the repreſſing of the Vicious, and leading them back to repentance; and that when it cannot come to that end by the way of Exhortation and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it has a right abſolutely to cut them off from the body of that Society. But beſides that thoſe kinds of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought never to fall upon a whole people, or upon a whole multitude, for fear of involving the innocent with the guilty; they never ought to be uſed, but in reſpect of impenitent ſinners only, obſtinate in their crimes, and publickly maintaining them. For the reſt we ought to agree, that an exact diſcerning of the good and the wicked, will not be made till the laſt day; and that till then, God would have us ſuffer that mixture, without partaking with the ſins of the wicked, and without approving them; but yet without breaking under that pretence the bond of External Communion. The Reaſon of this conduct is, that it would not be poſſible for one to deprive ones ſelf of the communion of the wicked, without depriving ones ſelf at the ſame Time of that of many righteous, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has very well demonſtrated againſt the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> So that it would not be a ſufficient reaſon for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the communion of a Church, only to alledge a general depravation of manners, even when it ſhould be true, that it did reign therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97749:152"/>
But it is no leſs certain, that when it falls out, that one party of the Church conſidered in the ſecond reſpect, that is to ſay, in as much as it is a mingled Body of good and bad, ſhould confirm it ſelf in Errors, and in practices contrary to the ſervice of God and the ſalvation of men; and that not only it rejects the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions given it upon that occaſion, but would even force all others to have the ſame ſentiments, and to practiſe the ſame Worſhip, the Separation of the other Party is juſt, neceſſary and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable. It is juſt; for every where, where there can be nothing elſe but an unjuſt Communion, there is Juſtice in a Separation from it. But there can be nothing elſe but an unjuſt Communion with a Party, which eſſentially deſtroyes the True Worſhip of God, which ſhuts up it ſelf in Errors directly contrary to mens ſalvation, and which through an intolerable Tyranny would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain all thoſe who live in it, to make a Profeſſion of the ſame Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. It is then juſt for a man to ſeparate himſelf from it.</p>
               <p>But I ſay further, that that Separation is neceſſary and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable for divers Reaſons.</p>
               <p>The Firſt of all is, becauſe of the viſible danger whereby a man would inſenſibly expoſe himſelf to let his Faith be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and his Worſhip be violated by the commerce which that ſame Communion would force him to. In effect, when a man is in thoſe Aſſemblies, and ſees himſelf under one and the ſame Miniſtry with perſons infected with Errors, and engaged in a falſe Worſhip, and who would force all others to be there too, what caution ſoever he ſhould uſe, it is impoſſible that he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf in Purity, or at leaſt, that he ſhould not be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual danger of corrupting himſelf, or falling into hypocriſie in making a profeſſion to believe that which he does not. He ought therefore to ſeparate himſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He ought to do ſo, by reaſon of the inevitable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to which he would expoſe his children. For if it ſhould be true, that Adult perſons might live in communion with ſuch a Party as I have ſuppos'd, without being infected with its poyſon, or without being hypocrites, which it is no wayes poſſible for them to do, it would not be conceivable, that their children could be exempted from that danger by ordinary wayes, whatſoever care they ſhould elſewhere take of their education. It would be therefore to proſtitute and deſtroy them, and by conſequence for a man to deſtroy himſelf; for every one ought to anſwer before God for the ſalvation of his children as his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97749:153"/>
But beſides theſe two intereſts, which impoſe an indiſpenſable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity on him, it is (3.) further certain, that a man could not without a crime, nor even without a manifeſt contradiction, own thoſe for his brethren, whom he believes God does not own for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and who are not in a condition to become ſuch. A Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Society is a Myſtical Family, into which, to judge of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its natural appointment, one ought to admit thoſe only, who may be charitably and rationally judg'd to be in a ſtate of Adoption towards God, and at the fartheſt, ſuch as are apparently in a ſtate of Converſion, or of Repentance: and in regard even of theſe latter, there ought to be ſome Time ſuſpended, before the giving them external pledges of that Communion, till their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or their Repentance appear more fully. They ſuffer the wicked to be there, when their birth or their hypocriſie have externally introduc'd them, only by accident, to avoid troubles and ſcandals. And therefore it was that the Ancient Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd but three ſorts of perſons only to be in its Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the Faithful, the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and the Penitents; but as for thoſe who taught falſe Doctrine, or practis'd a falſe Worſhip, it never had any Union with them. Not only the Ancients had no Communion with them; but to ſhew how neceſſary and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſable they judg'd a ſeparation from them to be, they went ſo far as to refuſe their Communion with the Orthodox themſelves, when either by ſurpriſe or weakneſs, or ſome other intereſt, they had receiv'd Hereticks into their Communion, altho' as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they had kept their Faith in its Purity. We find in the Life of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> that his Father, who was alſo called <hi>Gregory,</hi> and who was Biſhop of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> before him, having been deceiv'd by a fallacious Writing, and having given his Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the <hi>Arians,</hi> all the Monks of his Dioceſs, with the greateſt part of his Church ſeparated themſelves from him, altho' they well knew, that he had not changed his mind, nor embraced Hereſie. And even the Orthodox of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> refuſed to hold Communion with Pope <hi>Felix,</hi> as <hi>Theodoret</hi> tells us, altho' he intirely held the Creed of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> becauſe he held Communion with the <hi>Arians.</hi> This I mention not abſolutely to approve of that carriage, but only to ſhew, how far their aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion went heretofore, which they had for holding Communion with Hereticks.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are prepoſſeſs'd againſt all ſorts of Separation in the Matters of Religion, ought to remember, that the obligation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97749:153"/>
that lyes upon them to hold Communion with thoſe with whom they are externally joyn'd, is not without its bounds and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. We are joyn'd together under certain conditions, which are principally the profeſſion of a pure faith, or at leaſt ſuch as is free from all damnable Errors, a Worſhip freed from all that which is oppoſite to the eſſence of Piety; in a word, a Publick Miniſtry, under which we may work out our own ſalvation. While theſe conditions remain, they make the Communion ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; but when they fail, the Communion fails alſo, and there is a juſt ground for a Separation, provided we obſerve theſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Cautions.</p>
               <p>They cannot ſay, in this caſe, that we ſeparate our ſelves from the Church, nor that we forſake her Communion, or that we break her Unity. For the forſaken party being truly ſuch as we ſuppoſe it, ought not to be any more looked on as the Church of Jeſus Chriſt, but only as a party of the worldly who were before mingled with the Truly Faithful, and who through their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in their Errors and falſe Worſhip had diſcover'd themſelves, and had themſelves torn off the vail which as yet confounded them after a manner, with the others. The Orthodox in the firſt Ages did not in the leaſt break the Unity of the Church, when they would not hold Communion with the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites,</hi> the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and the other Heterodox of thoſe times, as I have noted already, no more than thoſe, who with ſo much conſtancy and reſolution refuſed to hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the <hi>Arrians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ought not therefore preſently to condemn all kind of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and ſince there are ſuch kinds of it as are neceſſary, juſt and lawful, as there are ſuch as are unjuſt and raſh, it would be the extremity of folly to judge of all after the ſame manner without any difference or diſtinction. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church her ſelf, which has ſometimes cut off whole Nations, as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> from her Communion, which may have been ſeen to have been ſo often divided into divers parties, whereof one has excommunicated the other, would not it may be freely ſuffer, that we ſhould treat of matters with this confuſion. So that diſputing at preſent about our Separation with her, we ſhall demand no unjuſt or unreaſonable thing, when we tell them that we ought to examine of what nature that Separation is, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reaſons, and wiſely to weigh the circumſtances; for if our Fathers ſeparated themſelves upon light grounds, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97749:154"/>
having any ſufficient cauſe, if they were even under circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which ought to have bound them to have remained united with the other Party, which was not for a Reformation, we ſhall agree with all our hearts to condemn them: but if, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the reaſons which they had were juſt, ſufficient and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, if there was nothing in the circumſtances of times, places, perſons that could hinder them from doing that which they did, it is certain, that inſtead of condemning them, we ſhould bleſs them, we ſhould think our ſelves happy in following their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps; and as for the reproaches and venomous accuſations of the Author of the Prejudices and ſuch like, we ſhould bear them with patience, looking on them as the effect of a blind paſſion.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore begin to make that Examination, by the Cauſes of our Separation. Every one knows what the matters that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide us are; that they are not either Points of meer Diſcipline, ſuch as that for which <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeparated his Church from thoſe of <hi>Aſia,</hi> who ſhould keep the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> on the fourteenth day of the Moon, nor meerly Queſtions of the School, which conſiſt in nothing but terms remote from the knowledge of the Vulgar, as that which they call <hi>trium Capitulorum,</hi> which raiſed ſo many troubles in the Times of the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> and Pope <hi>Vigilius;</hi> nor in meer perſonal intereſts, ſuch as we may ſee in the Schiſms of Anti-Popes; nor purely in perſonal Crimes or Accuſations, as in the Schiſm of the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> nor even in a general corruption of Manners, altho' that was extreamly great in the time of our Fathers. The Articles that ſeparate us, are points that according to us, eſſentially diſturb the Faith by which we are united to Jeſus Chriſt, points which eſſentially alter the Worſhip that we owe to God, which eſſentially deprave the ſources of our Juſtification, and which corrupt both the external and internal means of our obtaining Grace and Glory. In a word, they are ſuch Points as we believe to be wholly incompatible with ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which by conſequence hinder us from being able to give it the Title or the Quality of a true Church of Jeſus Chriſt to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is obſtinate in the profeſſion and practice of them, and which would force us to be ſo too. I confeſs, that we cannot ſay, that our Controverſies are all of that importance; there are ſome undoubtedly, which are of leſſer weight and force, which it was fitting for them to reform themſelves in, but which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding would not have given alone a juſt cauſe of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97749:154"/>
In this rank I place the Queſtion of the <hi>Limbus</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fathers, that of the Local Deſcent of Jeſus Chriſt into Hell, that of the diſtinction of Prieſts and Biſhops to be of Divine Right, that of the keeping of <hi>Lent,</hi> and ſome others of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where there might have been ſeen Error and Superſtition enough to be corrected; but which would not have gone ſo far, as to have cauſed a rupture of Communion. So that, it is not for theſe kinds of things, that our Fathers left the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> they had more ſufficient, more urgent and indiſpenſable reaſons in the other controverſies, among which, that of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Meritorious Works, and by Indulgences, Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, the Adoration of the Euchariſt, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, Invocation of Saints and Angels, religious worſhipping of Images, Humane Satisfactions, the Lordſhip of the Pope and his Clergy over mens Conſciences, held the chiefeſt place. Theſe are the true Points which cauſed a Separation; and if the others contributed any thing to it, it was only by the connexion which they had with theſe here; or becauſe they noted a general Spirit of Superſtition contrary to true Piety; or in fine, by reaſon of their number: for ſometimes divers both leſs dangerous each to a part, all together make a mortal and incurable diſeaſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, it appears that our Fathers had beſides but too juſt and neceſſary reaſons of their Separation.</p>
               <p>But to come to ſet out this matter in its full evidence, it will be requiſite to ſee what they can ſay in oppoſition to what I have ſaid. It ſeems to me, that they can take but one of theſe Three ſides. 1. Either to deny, that the Tranſubſtantiation, Adoration of the Euchariſt, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we call Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, are ſo in effect: Or, 2. To ſay, That even when they ſhould ſuppoſe that they were Errors, they would not nevertheleſs take away from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the quality of a true Church. Neither would they be incompatible with ſalvation, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they could not be a ſufficient cauſe of Separation. 3. Or in fine, to maintain, that even when theſe Points ſhould be a ſufficient cauſe of Separation, they could not be ſo, at leaſt in regard of our Fathers, becauſe our Fathers were by right ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their ordinary Paſtors, dependent upon their Hierarchical Government, and chiefly upon that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they pretend, is the Mother and Miſtreſs of all others, and the Center of Chriſtian Unity; from whence it follows, that they could never ſeparate themſelves, but that on the contrary they were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97749:155"/>
bound to receive all the conditions it required to be in its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Theſe are the only Three things in my judgement, which they can propoſe with any colour. I will examine the laſt in the following Chapter; let us here conſider theſe two others.</p>
               <p>The Firſt neceſſarily engages the man who will make uſe of it, to enter into an Examination of the foundation of thoſe matters, or which comes to the ſame things, ſolidly to eſtabliſh the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of that Party that adheres to it; which is a general Controverſie, that includes all the others, as I have ſhewn in the Firſt Part of this Work: And by conſequence, he muſt renounce all that wrangling diſpute which goes only upon prejudices. The juſtice or injuſtice of our Separation will depend on the Foundation. For how can they aſſure themſelves, that thoſe things which we call Errors and a falſe Worſhip are on the contrary, Evangelical Truths, and a right and lawful Worſhip, without going on to that Examination: which ſhews, as I have already frequently obſerved, that all thoſe indirect attacks which they aſſault us with, are nothing elſe but vain amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and beatings of the Air, which ſerve only to make a noiſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing will not leſs engage them in the Examination of the foundation of thoſe matters, than the Firſt. For in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that thoſe things which we call Errors, are ſuch in effect, they muſt neceſſarily ſee, of what nature they are, and what op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they have to true Piety, to judge aright, whether they are ſufficient cauſes for a Separation, and whether our conſcience cannot accommodate it ſelf to them. I confeſs, that this is no very hard matter to be known; for how ſmall a knowledge ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may have of Religion and the Worſhip of God, they may very eaſily perceive, that if Tranſubſtantiation for example, is an Error, they cannot but adore the ſubſtance of Bread in the room of Jeſus Chriſt; they may eaſily perceive, that if the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images is forbidden by the ſecond Commandment of the Law, they draw upon themſelves the jealouſie of God, as he himſelf declares there; they may eaſily perceive, that if the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs is not in effect a propitiatory Sacrifice, by which they may apply to themſelves the vertue of that on the Croſs, they do an injury to the only Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, and that they vainly ſeek the vertue of it in an Act, where it is not applyed: They may eaſily perceive, that if the Lordſhip that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or its Councils, uſurp over mens Conſciences,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97749:155"/>
is ill-grounded; that they render unto men a kind of adoration which is only due to God alone, which cannot but be an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable crime in regard of him who has ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me.</hi> But whether it would be an eaſie or a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter to be known, that is not the buſineſs about which we diſpute at preſent. It is ſufficient to ſhew, that the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Fathers had juſt; ſufficient, neceſſary and indiſputable cauſes; ſuppoſing that what they ſaid of the Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were true, and that they could not be accuſed either of raſhneſs or of Schiſm, without conteſting their ſuppoſition; nor that they could conteſt their ſuppoſition, without coming to an inſpection into the very things themſelves. Whence it follows, that all that diſpute which they raiſe againſt us about Forms, is but a meer vain wrangling, unworthy of any ſound perſons. If that which our Fathers have laid down concerning the Errors which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> forces men to believe to be of her Communion, be not true, we do not any further pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Separation; but if it be true, God and men will bear them witneſs, that it was juſtly done, and according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of an upright conſcience.</p>
               <p>They will ſay it may be, That we ought not upon ſuch light grounds to ſuppoſe, that that which our Fathers ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is true: ſince they are the Points in diſpute, wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends that we are in an Error, as we pretend that ſhe is. But there cannot be any thing ſaid more frivolous; for the ſuppoſition that we make, is in words of good ſenſe and right reaſon, becauſe we make it to force our adverſaries to come to a diſcuſſion of the things themſelves, upon which the judgement that ought to be made of our Separation depends, and to make them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that all thoſe Accuſations which they form againſt our Fathers, that they have broken the Chriſtian Unity, that they have forſook the Church, that they have made a criminal Schiſm, are raſh accuſations, unjuſt and precipitate, ſince they cannot rightly judge of their Action, either to condemn or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it, until firſt of all they have examined the Cauſes of their Separation, and the Reaſons which they have alledged, which can never be done, but by a diſcuſſion of the Foundation. In effect, Every Accuſation, which has no certain Foundation, and which one muſt be compell'd to retract, is precipitate and raſh. But that which they form againſt our Fathers, before their having
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97749:156"/>
examined the foundation, is of that nature. It has no certain foundation; for they cannot know, whether their action be juſt or unjuſt; and they may be forced to retract it, when they ſhall have examined their reaſons. It is therefore a condemnable raſhneſs in them who have a right to repell, till they have made that examination; and it is to oblige them to do it, that we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that our Fathers had right at the Foundation.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That our Fathers were bound to ſeparate themſelves from the Body of thoſe who poſſeſs'd the Miniſtry in the Church, and particularly in the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>ſuppoſing that they had a right at the Foundation.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt they will ſay, <hi>Whatſoever we ſhould pretend, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do otherwiſe than condemn the Separation of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not for not having juſt grounds of Separation; but becauſe the right of ſeparating ones ſelf, does not belong to all ſorts of perſons, and the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>being, by a ſpecial privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Mother and Miſtreſs of all others, we could never lawfully ſeparate our ſelves from her; and becauſe it is on the contrary indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably neceſſary to the ſalvation of men to obey, and to remain in her Communion. So that your Fathers being, on one ſide, ſubject to their ordinary Paſtors, they ought never to have divided themſelves from their Body, for what cauſe ſoever there ſhould have been; and on the other ſide, there being no True Church, and by conſequence, no Salvation to be had, otherwiſe than in the Communion of the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>it is a crime for any to ſeparate themſelves from it, whatſoever pretence they can urge for that purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Objection is founded upon theſe two Propoſitions: the one, That we never ought to ſeparate our ſelves from the Body of her ordinary Paſtors; and the other, That we ought never to ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in particular.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt of theſe Propoſitions, I confeſs as I have ſaid elſewhere, that the people owe a great reſpect and obedience to the Paſtors that adminiſter to them the nouriſhment of their ſouls, the words of eternal life; according to the Precept of St. <hi>Paul, Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls.</hi> This obedience ought to be <note place="margin">Heb: 13.</note> accompanyed with a real eſteem, that ſhould make us to preſume well of them, which ſhould give us a readineſs to be inſtructed by their word, and be very remote from calumnies, murmurs and raſh ſuſpicions founded upon light appearances; and that obedience, that eſteem, that good opinion ought to be without doubt greater for all the Body in general, than for particular men in it; for there is a greater probability, that a whole body ſhould
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97749:157"/>
contain more light, and by conſequence more authority, than each private man could have. I ſay, that when even Vices are generally ſpread over the whole body of the Paſtors, the people ought to labour to bear them with patience, and cover them, as much as they can, with charity, in praying to God, that it would pleaſe him to cleanſe his Sanctuary, and to ſend good Labourers into his harveſt: and howſoever it ſhould be, while they can work out their ſalvation under their Miniſtry, they ought not to ſeparate themſelves from them.</p>
               <p>But we ought not alſo to imagine, that the Duty of a people toward their ordinary Paſtors, ſhould be without all bounds, or that their dependance on them, ſhould have no meaſure. That which we have ſaid in the firſt Chapter touching the bonds of Church Communion, ought to be extended to the Paſtors and to the people, their duties are mutual, and there is none but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt alone, on whom they can depend without conditions. To flatter the Body of the Paſtors with that priviledge, is to ſet up men upon the Throne of God; to inſpire them with pride, vanity, negligence, it is to ſet up a Lordſhip in the Church, that Jeſus Chriſt has forbid, and to give Paſtors the boldneſs to do and adventure upon all things. It is certain therefore, that the Tye which the Faithful have to their ordinary Paſtors, is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited; and that it ought to endure, but as far as the glory of God, the Fidelity that we owe to Jeſus Chriſt, and the hope of our own ſalvation can ſubſiſt with their Government. If it fall out ſo, that their Government cannot be any further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with thoſe things, in that caſe, they ought to ſeparate; and it would be to ſet up the moſt ſenſeleſs, wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane propoſition in the world, to ſay the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Miniſtry of the Paſtors is eſtabliſh'd in the Church only as a meer external means, to preſerve the True Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip there, and to lead men to ſalvation. But the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches us, that when meer external means ſhall be remote from their end, and that inſtead of guiding us to their end, they turn us away from, and deprive us of it; that then the love which we have for the end, ought to prevail over that which we may have for the means; becauſe the means are only deſirable, in reference to their end; and the regard which we have for them, is but an effect, or a production of that which we have for the end. So that when thoſe who are wont to diſtribute to us aliments neceſſary to our lives, give us on the contrary, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous

meat inſtead of aliments, and when they will force us to take them, we muſt no longer doubt, that the intereſt of our life ought to take us off from that Tye which we might have had to thoſe perſons. A Guide is a means to conduct us to the place whither we deſire to go; but when we know, that that Guide leads us in a falſe way, and that inſtead of helping us to go to that place, he makes us wander from it, it is no queſtion, but that we ought to ſeparate from him, and renounce his conduct. The ordinary Paſtors are Guides, men that ought to ſhew us the way to Heaven; if therefore inſtead of ſhewing us, they make us go a quite contrary way, who can doubt that we are bound to forſake them?</p>
               <p>But they will ſay, How can they be forſaken, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting God himſelf, who has ſubjected them to them? Is not their Miniſtry a Divine Inſtitution, and is it not Jeſus Chriſt, who by the teſtimony of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> has <hi>given ſome to be Apoſtles,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the aſſembling of the Saints?</hi> I anſwer, That we muſt diſtinguiſh that which there is of divine in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, from that which there is of humane in it. That there ſhould be Miniſters in the Church, is Gods Inſtitution; but that the Miniſtry ſhould be committed to ſuch or ſuch perſons, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, who were the firſt Paſtors of it, that is in the diſpoſal of men. The Order of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry therefore is inviolable, becauſe it comes from God: it is not permitted to any Creature to aboliſh it. But it is not the ſame cf perſons raiſed to the Office of the Miniſtry; for as it is by the means of men that they receive their Call, it frequently happens, that their Call is corrupted by the Vices of thoſe who give, and of thoſe who receive it, in that reſpect it is corruptible. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, Ambition, Covetouſneſs, and a Spirit of Pride and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, Error, Superſtition, Ignorance, Negligence often mingle themſelves with it, and ſully the holineſs of the Miniſtry. When that corruption is only in ſome private men, the ordinary wayes of Diſcipline may be uſed againſt them; they may cut them off, depoſe, excommunicate them according to the exigency of the caſe. But when it ſpreads over all the body in ſuch a manner, and to that degree, that the ſafety of the Faithful can no longer ſubſiſt under the conduct of thoſe perſons; and that there is no hope among them of any amendment, then the only remedy that remains, is to ſeparate from them: and it would be ſo far from either violating the order of God, or oppoſing the Miniſtry
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97749:158"/>
that he had ſet up, that it would be on the contrary to deliver it, as much as in us lay, out of the hands of thoſe who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded it; and to draw it out of that oppreſſion to which they have reduced it. This Separation therefore only regards thoſe perſons who were unlawfully called to the Miniſtry, and who abuſed it againſt God and his Church, and not that which it has of Divine, but that which it has in it of Humane and Corruptible; or to ſay better, that which it had actually corrupted in that Call.</p>
               <p>The Choice of perſons, and their Elevation to Eccleſiaſtical Functions, being a Humane thing, and by conſequence expoſed to all the accidents of mens weakneſs and corruption, we cannot imagine, without doing an injury to the Wiſdom of God, that he would have ſo ſtrictly and ſo ſeverely ty'd his faithful to them, that they ſhould not have had any power to ſeparate in any caſe. For if it were ſo, it might happen, that the Truth might be forced to yield to Hereſie, and Piety to Impiety; it might happen, that the Children of God might be under the conduct of his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red enemies, without their being able to withdraw themſelves; it might happen, that the faithful might be engaged in an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent danger, or even in a neceſſity of loſing the purity of their faith, through the contagion of their Guides, and have no means to draw themſelves out of it; all which is incompatible with the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>But is it not a very amazing thing, to ſee a people ſeparate from the Body of thoſe who poſſeſs the Offices of the Church? It is without doubt; and God will not alſo permit his Children to be often reduced to ſo great a neceſſity: Notwithſtanding he permits it ſometimes, to afflict his people, and to chaſtiſe them for the contempt they have had of his Word and his Favours. He permits it, to ſhew, that the ſubſiſtence of his Church and the ſalvation of his faithful does not abſolutely depend upon humane means, ſince thoſe means may be perverted, and fall out contrary to their appointment. He permits it in fine, by thoſe ſad examples, to keep the Paſtors in humility, and in a care to acquit themſelves faithfully of their Charges, and to hinder the people from neglecting to inſtruct themſelves in the Myſteries of the Goſpel, and that they ſhould not rely with too much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon their Paſtors. But when God reduces the Faithful to that extraordinary neceſſity, beſides that the ſcandal of a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the other inconveniences that follow, cannot of right, but be imputed to the Paſtors who have degenerated from their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97749:158"/>
Call, and abandoned the ſaving Truth which was committed to them, and the due care of their Flocks, to become oppreſſors of them. Beſides that, I ſay, it is evident, that that ſcandal and thoſe inconveniences, whatſoever they are, would never balance theſe two weighty intereſts, to wit, that of working out ones ſalvation, and that of preſerving the Goſpel, which are ſo great, that nothing in the world can over-rule them. On the contrary ſide, the higher the place of thoſe is elevated, who beſtow thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Charges, and the more general the Corruption of thoſe is who hold them, the ſtronger and more indiſpenſable obligation lyes on the Faithful, to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from them: for then the evil is in publick channels, and death runs in the ſame places from whence they ſhould receive their life. Juſt ſo as when the Air of a Town is infected, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of withdrawing from it ſuddenly, is ſo much the greater, becauſe the Air is of a more ordinary uſe, than any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>They who would not have us in any caſe have a right to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate our ſelves from the Body of thoſe who poſſeſs the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, have never conſidered well of what nature that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, which the Faithful have with Jeſus Chriſt, and of what nature that is, which they have with their Paſtors. For if the people had a mediate Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate one with their Paſtors; that is to ſay, if they were only united to Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they are ſo to their Paſtors, and becauſe the Paſtors are ſo to Jeſus Chriſt, as the hand is united to the head, only becauſe that is ſo to the arm, and becauſe the arm is ſo to the head, they would poſſibly have ſome reaſon to ſay, that there could be no caſe, wherein the people ought to ſeparate themſelves from their Paſtors, becauſe they could maintain, that the Paſtors were a neceſſary <hi>medium</hi> for the people to be joyned to Jeſus Chriſt, as the arm is a neceſſary <hi>medium</hi> for the hand to be joyned to the head. But it is quite otherwiſe. For the Faithful are united to Jeſus Chriſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and with their Paſtors mediately; that is to ſay, they are united to their Paſtors, only becauſe they are united to Jeſus Chriſt, and becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is united to the Paſtors; ſo far<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the Paſtors from being a neceſſary <hi>medium</hi> to the faithful to their being joyned to Jeſus Chriſt, that on the contrary, Jeſus Chriſt is a neceſſary <hi>medium</hi> for them to be joyned to their Paſtors. Both People and Paſtors are united immediately with Jeſus Chriſt, and by Jeſus Chriſt we are united together; for Jeſus Chriſt is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97749:159"/>
the center and bond of our mutual Communion: Therefore the Apoſtle ſharply cenſures the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for this, that they were divided among themſelves, one ſaying, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I am of <hi>Apollos,</hi> and another I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and another, I am of Chriſt, <hi>is Chriſt,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>divided? Was</hi> Paul <hi>crucified for you, or were you baptized in the name of</hi> Paul? Which implyes this, that we are all immediately united to Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe it is <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note> he only who dyed for us, and in his name alone that we are baptized: and to pretend that the faithful are joyned to Jeſus Chriſt by his Miniſters, is to divide him into as many Parties, or into as many Sects, as there are Miniſters. But it manifeſtly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from thence, that the faithful ought to be no further united with their Paſtors, than as it ſhall appear to them that their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors are to Jeſus Chriſt; and that they ought to ſeparate from them, when it ſhall appear to them, that they themſelves are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from him, and that they would ſeparate the Flocks which they had committed to them. This is what the light of common ſenſe dictates without further reaſoning; for to what good would the Communion of thoſe pretended Paſtors tend, howſoever inveſted they ſhould be in Titles and Dignities, without that of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>That which I have ſaid of their Communion with them, I muſt alſo ſay of their dependence on them. That which the Faithful have upon Jeſus Chriſt is immediate and abſolute, and that which they have on their Paſtors, is mediate and conditional: our Souls and our Conſciences do not belong to them to diſpoſe of at their will and pleaſure. In this reſpect we belong to Jeſus Chriſt alone, who has purchaſed us at the price of his blood, and who governs us by his Spirit and his Word. The Paſtors are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſters, Interpreters, or the Heralds who make us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Voice, and all the dependence which we have on them is founded upon that, which both they and we have upon Jeſus Chriſt our Soveraign Lord, of which it is both the cauſe, and the rule and meaſure. We ought therefore to be ſubject to them, while they ſhall act as his Miniſters, and his Interpreters, while their Actions and their Government bear the characters of his Authority. But as thoſe Miniſters are men who may abuſe their Offices, and act againſt their head, if it happen that the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Divine Authority which ſubjects us to them, do not appear in their word, if there appear a contrary character there, if inſtead of leading us to Jeſus Chriſt, they turn us from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97749:159"/>
him, if they would govern as Lords, and not as Miniſters, if they attribute that abſolute obedience to themſelves which we own to none beſides our Saviour. In a word, if to depend on them we muſt violate the dependence which we have on Jeſus Chriſt, can they then ſay that we cannot, and that we ought not to ſeparate from them, and to renounce an unjuſt Government?</p>
               <p>If they would decide this Queſtion by the Scripture, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That if he himſelf or an Angel from Heaven ſhould preach to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>us another Goſpel than that which he has preached, he ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</hi> He ſayes, that upon the occaſion of ſome falſe Teachers that troubled the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and ſpeaking only of them, one would think that he ought to have been contented to have let his <hi>Anathema</hi> fall upon thoſe particular Teachers that might err, and who had not ſo great an Authority, but that one might very well ſeparate himſelf from them, when they ſhould happen to prevaricate. But to take away all pretence of diſtinction and wrangling diſputes, he makes a moſt expreſs choice of two of the greateſt Authorities that were among creatures, of an Angel and an Apoſtle, the only two created Authorities to which God has communicated the favour of Infallibility, and he has enjoyn'd us to anathematize them, if it ſhould happen that they ſhould preach another Goſpel, than that of Jeſus Chriſt: we know very well, that the Angels of Heaven are uncapable of ever commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that ſin; we know very well, that he himſelf would never have committed it; and yet notwithſtanding, he turns his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon himſelf and upon the Angels; and is not this to give us to underſtand, that there is no created Authority either in the Heaven, or upon the Earth, upon which we ought abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to depend, and from which we ought not to ſeparate, in caſe it ſhould turn us from Jeſus Chriſt? Let them tell us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the dependance that the people owe to the body of their ordinary Paſtors, that is to ſay, of thoſe who poſſeſs the Offices of the Church, who may have been very ill choſen, who may have intruded themſelves by very bad wayes, who may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out therein to all the paſſions and diſorders of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: whether, I ſay, the dependence which they owe to them, be ſtronger and more inviolable, than that which they ought to have for an Apoſtle, and ſuch an Apoſtle as St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and even for an Angel from Heaven, if he ſhould become a Preacher? This latter dependence notwithſtanding, is not abſolute, it may be lawfully broken upon a certain caſe: who will take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97749:160"/>
to ſay, after that, that it cannot and ought not to be done in a like caſe?</p>
               <p>But if to the Scripture we would add experience, that would teach us, that there have been ſometimes thoſe ſeaſons, in which good men have been forced to ſeparate themſelves from the Body of their Paſtors: for not to ſpeak of the ſeven thouſand which in <hi>Elias</hi>'s time preſerved their purity againſt the Idolatry whereinto the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had fallen, who according to all that appears, lived ſeparated from the Body of their Idolatrous Paſtors, at leaſt in a negative Separation, we need but to turn our eyes to the Example of the Orthodox in the time of the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> For there are two actions evident in that Hiſtory, one, that <hi>Arianiſm</hi> had invaded the body of the Ordinary Paſtors; and the other, that thoſe among the Orthodox who were of any zeal and courage, ſeparated themſelves from that infected body, and would not own them for <hi>True Paſtors,</hi> while they ſhould remain in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. The firſt of theſe Actions is juſtified by almoſt an infinite number of proofs taken out either from Hiſtory, or the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Ancients. For before the death of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the <hi>Arians</hi> who had been condemned in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſon of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and ſome time after they baniſh'd him as far as <hi>Treves.</hi> This was their firſt Victory; but they did not ſtop there: they got over to their ſide, the Spirit of <hi>Conſtance</hi> after the death of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who remaining ſole Emperour, employed all his Authority, and the <hi>Arians</hi> all their artifices to eſtabliſh <hi>Arianiſm</hi> every where. The greateſt part of the Biſhops fell either under their violence, or ſeduction. Divers Councils were aſſembled, and many forms of faith laid down there, which all tended to ſet up the Dogm of <hi>Arius,</hi> ſome more openly and others more covertly. Thoſe among the Biſhops who made any oppoſition, were cruelly perſecuted, depoſed from their places, ſent into exile, and treated as Hereticks, or the enemies of the Churches peace. Therefore it was, that <hi>Conſtance</hi> reproached <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> that he was alone, and that he oppoſed himſelf to all the world, in the defence of <hi>Athanaſius. When ſo great a part of the</hi>

Liberius</hi> himſelf was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, from which he was not freed till after he ſubſcribed to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97749:160"/>
                  <hi>Arianiſm.</hi> And as the Weſt was then leſs infected with this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie than the Eaſt, the Emperour cauſed a Council to aſſemble at <hi>Ariminum,</hi> in which, after ſpecious beginnings, the end was very unhappy. For the Biſhops renounced therein the Orthodox Doctrine, which made the Son of God of one and the ſame Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with his Father: To this effect, they rejected the word <hi>conſubſtantial,</hi> which the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had inſerted into its Creed, as a word that was <hi>ſcandalous, ſacrilegious</hi> and <hi>unworthy of God;</hi> which was no where to be found in the Scripture, and they baniſhed it from the Church. This appears by the Letter of that Synod it ſelf to the Emperour <hi>Conſtance,</hi> ſet down by S. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,</hi> in which they gave the Emperour thanks, <hi>that he had ſhewn</hi>

                  <hi>them what they ought to do, to wit, to decree, that no body ſhould ſpeak any more either of ſubſtance or of conſubſtantial, which are names unknown to the Church of God; and that they rejoyced, becauſe they had acknowledged the very ſame thing that they had held before.</hi> They add, <hi>That the Truth, which cannot be overcome, has obtained the victory, ſo that that name unworthy of God which was not to be found wrote in the Sacred Laws, ſhould not be for the future mentioned by any perſon;</hi> and they declare, <hi>That they intirely hold the ſame Doctrine with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Churches, and that they have rendred unto them and him a full obedience.</hi> It was that reaſon for which <hi>Auxentius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Millan,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I might add to theſe teſtimonies that of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> in the Oration that he made in the praiſe of S. <hi>Athanaſius:</hi> There, after having deſcribed the furies of <hi>George</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and an <hi>Arian,</hi> and the impieties of the Council of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> he adds, <hi>We may ſee one ſort unjuſtly baniſhed from their Sees, and other put</hi>

                  <hi>into their places, after their having ſubſcribed to the impiety, which was required of them as a neceſſary condition. Plotting never ceaſed on one ſide, nor the Calumniator on the other. This is that which has made many among us fall into the ſnare, who were elſe invincible; for although their error did not go ſo far, as to ſeduce their minds, yet they ſubſcrib'd notwithſtanding; and by that means conſpired with the moſt wicked men, and if they were not partakers in their flames, they were at leaſt blackned with their ſmoak. This is that which has made me often pour forth rivers of tears, beholding wickedneſs ſpread abroad ſo wide and ſo much every where, and that thoſe themſelves that ought to have been the defenders of the Word there, have become the perſecutors of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Doctrine. For it is certain, that the Paſtors have been carried away after an inſenſible manner, and to ſpeak with the Scripture, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Paſtors have left my Vineyard deſolate; they have abuſed and loaded that deſirable portion with ſhame; that is to ſay, the Church of God, which the ſweat and blood of ſo many Martyrs before and ſince the coming of jeſus Chriſt, had beſprinkled, and which was conſecrated, by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of God himſelf, who dyed for our ſalvation. If you except ſome few, who have either been deſpiſed, by reaſon of the obſcurity of their names, or who have reſiſted by their vertue (for it is very requiſite, that there ſhould yet have ſome remained to be, as it were, a ſeed and a root to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to make it flouriſh and revive again) all were ſwayed by the Times. There was only this difference among them, that ſome were fallen deeper into the ſnare, and others more ſlowly; that ſome were the chief in wickedneſs, and others held the ſecond place.</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Baronius</hi> could not avoid making this reflection in ſetting <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baron. ad ann.</hi> 359.</note> down this paſſage: <hi>So it was that</hi> Gregory <hi>deplored the ruine of the whole Eaſtern Church. But if we would add</hi> the ruine that befell the Weſtern Church, which I have juſt before deſcribed, <hi>we ſhall eaſily judge, that there has not been any time ſince, wherein the whole Chriſtian World has been more diſturbed, than it was then, ſince almoſt all the Preachers of the Churches were fallen into the precipice, and that the face of the Catholick Church was never ſo dreadful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the ſecond Action which we have propounded, is not leſs certain than the former; to wit, that thoſe among the Orthodox who had any zeal or courage, ſeparated themſelves from the Body of their ordinary Paſtors, and would not own them for their Paſtors, while they remained in Hereſie. In effect, that was the chief cauſe for which they ſuffered ſo many murders and baniſhments, the <hi>Arians</hi> no wayes tolerating thoſe who refuſed their Communion. The perpetual Accuſation wherewith they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97749:161"/>
charged them, was, That they were the Schiſmaticks who had violated the Peace and Unity of the Church. This is that which <hi>Auxentius</hi> reproached S. <hi>Hilary</hi> with, and <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Verceille</hi> in the Letter which I have before cited. <hi>They are,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>men condemned and depoſed, who think of nothing but making of Schiſms whereſoever they come;</hi> for ſo it was, that that falſe Biſhop called the juſt Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to which S. <hi>Hilary</hi> exhorted the faithful, by his Writings, as we have ſeen in the preceding Chapter.</p>

to the Emperour, and acquainted him with that obſtinate reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and cauſed him to revoke the Orders he had given. I confeſs, that there were many of the Orthodox, who had not courage enough to go ſo far as a Separation, and who content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with only groaning under the <hi>Arian</hi> Tyranny, in waiting for better Times. But it is alſo certain, that thoſe who had more zeal and courage withdrew themſelves from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of thoſe Hereticks, and that they believed themſelves bound to do it for the making ſure of their ſalvation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was that <hi>Fauſtinus</hi> in his Treatiſe againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> ſaid, <hi>That if any one did not believe that the Society of the</hi> Arians <hi>could be rendered culpable, under a pretence that he had the teſtimony of his own conſcience, which did not accuſe him of having violated or renounced the faith there, it belonged to ſuch a one to take heed, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf. But as for me,</hi> adds he, <hi>the cauſe of God being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, I judge my ſelf bound to be more pre-cautioned, and to have a greater fear than thoſe perſons have. For it is written, a man that is an Heretick after the firſt and ſecond admonition, reject; knowing that he who is ſuch, is perverted; and that he ſins, being condemned in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And as to the puniſhment of diſſemblers, it is written, All fleſh ſhall worſhip before my face, ſaith the Lord God, and the Saints ſhall come forth, and they ſhall ſee thoſe who have tranſgreſſed againſt me; for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa 66. 23,24.</note> 
                  <hi>the worm of the Hypocrites ſhall not dye, and their fire ſhall not be quenched. The Apoſtle forbids us alſo to enter into fellowſhip with unbelievers. And elſewhere, after having given a deſcription of ſins, he condemns not only thoſe who commit ſuch things; but thoſe alſo who conſent to thoſe who commit them. There are divers other paſſages in the Scripture, which forbid our companying with Hereticks; but I would only note theſe here briefly, to the end that you ſhould not think, that it is out of a vain ſuperſtition, that we avoid the Communion of thoſe whom the Divine Juſtice has condemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold then two Actions that I have propounded, in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficiently juſtified; and by conſequence, the right of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating our ſelves from the body of our ordinary Paſtors, when they teach Doctrines contrary to the true faith, which they would conſtrain the faithful to profeſs, eſtabliſhed by an example, againſt which I do not ſee any thing which they can rationally oppoſe, or hinder it from being like to that of our Fathers. For if they ſay, that there were in that party of the Orthodox that ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, divers Biſhops that authorized that Action; beſides that, we may ſay the ſame thing of the Party of the Reformation, in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97749:162"/>
which they know that there was a very conſiderable number of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Learned Prelates; and even ſome, who had the courage to ſuffer death in the defence of that cauſe. Beſides that, I ſay, it is certain, that it is not the Epiſcopal Dignity that makes the Reformation lawful, it is lawful as often as it has cauſes that are juſt, ſufficient and neceſſary at the foundation; and whereſoever thoſe cauſes are to be found, the faithful people have as much right to ſeparate themſelves as the Biſhops. If the people had no right to ſeparate themſelves from the Body of their Paſtors, who ſhould teach them falſe Doctrine, it could not be, by reaſon of the Authority which the Paſtors have over the people, for the Body of the Paſtors has at leaſt as much authority over particular Paſtors, as it has over the people; ſo that if that reaſon were not ſufficiently valid in regard of particular Biſhops, they may very well ſee, that it would not be ſo in regard of the faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. In effect a Separation founded upon the fear of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God, and prejudicing ones own ſalvation, is a common right; and the Laity are not leſs bound to it than the Biſhops, ſince both the one and the other, ought, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Apoſtle, <hi>to work out their own ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> If they ſay, that the Separation which fell out in time of the <hi>Arians</hi> was founded upon the Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, wherein <hi>Arius</hi> and his followers had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; whereas that of our Fathers is not eſtabliſhed by the Authority of any Council, ſince there is not one that has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Doctrines and Cuſtoms of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that this difference is yet null and void. For not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the <hi>Arians</hi> of whom we ſpeak, called themſelves the Catholicks, and took it as a great injury when they were called <hi>Arians,</hi> or Followers of <hi>Arius,</hi> and that their Councils had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced nothing directly againſt that of <hi>Nice,</hi> their ſeparation was founded upon the things themſelves, that is to ſay, upon the neceſſity of acknowledging the Son of God to be conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial with the Father, in order to the acknowledging him to be truly God, and not upon the bare Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to which they might have oppoſed that of the Church then in her Councils of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which included all the Eaſt and all the Weſt; and if they had had no more but that, they ought not to have ſeparated from the body of their actually governing Paſtors, that they might have cleaved to a Synod which was paſt and gone. It was therefore the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97749:163"/>
of the Truth that was conteſted, and that of the Error that was oppoſite to it, which made the Separation, and not the meer Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers; and therefore it is that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> diſputing againſt <hi>Maximinus</hi> an <hi>Arian,</hi> would that they ſhould ſet aſide as well the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as that of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum;</hi> and that they ſhould only contend about the things themſelves. Not but that ſometimes the Orthodox did ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> according to the manner of diſputes, where one will neglect no advantage, for its being ever ſo ſmall; but it was as a little help, and not as the eſſential reaſon of their Separation, which was alwayes taken from the thing it ſelf, and from the teſtimonies of the Scripture; ſo that that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is very frivolous. If they ſay laſtly, that the point that was controverted then, was one of a far greater importance, than thoſe upon which our Fathers ſeparated themſelves: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that indeed the Article of the Conſubſtantiality of the Son, is one of the chief and moſt fundamental Articles of the Chriſtian Religion; but that does not hinder, that thoſe that are controverted between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us, ſhould not alſo be of the greateſt importance to ſalvation, and ſufficient to cauſe a ſeparation. And when they would make the juſtice or injuſtice of ours to depend on that, they muſt quit all that vain diſpute of prejudices, and go on to the diſcuſſion of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Prejudices muſt not take it ill, that in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to decide the Queſtion concerning the right of the Separation of our Fathers, I make uſe here of his own proper teſtimony. For it is a matter ſurpriſing enough, that writing in his Eighth and Ninth Chapters, in which he would, he ſayes, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of Schiſm, without entring upon a diſcuſſion either of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 162.</note> 
                  <hi>or our Miſſion:</hi> that he ſhould not have remembred what he himſelf had juſt before ſaid in the Seventh. Firſt of all, he there propoſes this difficulty as on our ſide. <hi>If the viſible Church were really fallen into Error, as we ſuppoſe that it is poſſible for it to do, if it drive away the truly faithful from its boſome, if it perſecute</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 153.</note> 
                  <hi>them, muſt thoſe truly faithful needs be deprived of all external wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Religion, muſt they needs cleave to the Church to periſh with them, ſince we ſuppoſe that it reſides in them alone? Is it not againſt the Divine Providence, that the true worſhippers of God, the true heirs of Heaven, cannot form a Church in the World, and that God has not left any means to provide againſt ſo ſtrange an inconvenience?</hi> He
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97749:163"/>
anſwers plainly, <hi>That indeed, that inconvenience is exceeding great; but that it is not neceſſary that God ſhould have provided againſt it by remedies; becauſe he has reſolved to hinder it from ever falling out, in alwayes preſerving the True Miniſtry in his Church. So that it can never be in a neceſſity of being re-eſtabliſhed; and that very thing is a certain mark, that that inconvenience can never happen, in that God has not provided any remedy for it.</hi> He ſayes, that ſo it is that our Miniſters ought to conclude, and not to conclude as they do, in ſuppoſing that the viſible Church may fall into ruine, that there is a neceſſity of having recourſe to the eſtabliſhment of a new Miniſtry. Since immediately after, he adds, <hi>But if the adhaeſion which they have to their ſentiments, hinders them from coming to agree to this conſequence, they ought rather to conclude, that thoſe pretended truly faithful muſt remain in that ſtate, without Paſtors, and without any external worſhip; and that they ſhould rather expect, that God ſhould raiſe up ſome extraordinarily, and with viſible marks of their miſſion, than to uſurp to themſelves a right of creating Miniſters and Paſtors, and giving them power to govern the Churches, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have already ſhewn him, and we ſhall yet further ſhew him in the end, that it is not without reaſon, that we ſuppoſe, that the Miniſtry may be corrupted in the Church. We ſhall ſhew him alſo, that the conſequence which we draw from it concerning the re-eſtabliſhing of the Miniſtry, is juſt and right; and that a faithful people have a right in that caſe to create their Miniſters and their Paſtors, and to give them power to govern their Churches, and to adminiſter the Sacraments. But as we are only diſputing at preſent, about knowing whether we may ſeparate our ſelves from the body of the ordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, when they are fallen into errors incompatible with our ſalvation, and when they will force the people to profeſs the ſame Errors; it ſhall ſuffice at preſent, to take notice, that the Author of the Prejudices comes to agree, that when perſons are perſwaded, that the body of thoſe who poſſeſs the Miniſtry in the Church is fallen into Error, and when it drives away from its boſome, and perſecutes thoſe who maintain the Truth, they may remain ſeparated, without acknowledging that Body for their Paſtors, and without aſſiſting in their external worſhip; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they do not make other Miniſters. But who ſees not, that this is preciſely to acknowledge the right of that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, about which the queſtion at preſent is? Who ſees not,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97749:164"/>
that it is, at leaſt in that reſpect, a diſcharging our Fathers from the Accuſation of Schiſm, and to declare them further innocent of that crime, which he would deſign to lay to their charge at laſt? Our Fathers did not collect that conſequence of the Author of the Prejudices, they did not conclude, that the Miniſtry muſt be incorruptible in the Church, in that which it had of humane in it. This is not a place to diſpute, whether they adhered too much to their own opinions; where becauſe that in effect they judg'd well, that manner of reaſoning is pernicious. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were, they have concluded quite otherwiſe, they were perſwaded, that the body of thoſe who poſſeſſed the Ordinary Miniſtry in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, were fallen not only into an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, but into many, and into ſuch as were contrary to mens ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that it was guilty of opinionativeneſs in maintaining them, that it did impoſe a neceſſity upon all to profeſs them, that it drove away from its boſome thoſe who refuſed that obedience. It was upon this that they ſeparated themſelves from them, not acknowledging them any more for their Paſtors, and aſſiſting no further in their external worſhip. Thus far the Author of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices does not condemn them, he would only that they ſhould have remained throughout without Paſtors, and without external worſhip. We ſhall ſee in its place, whether there is reaſon for that or no; it is ſufficient, that he conſents, that they ſhould not any more have had thoſe for their Paſtors, which were ſo before, and that they ſhould have withdrawn themſelves from their communion and external worſhip; we demand no more at preſent.</p>
               <p>We ought now to paſs on to the ſecond Propoſition, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Objection is grounded that I have propounded in the beginning of this Chapter, and to examine, whether the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſuch, that one ought not upon any pretence whatſoever, to ſeparate ones ſelf from her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. All the world knows, that this is the pretenſion of that Church; and that it is for that, that ſhe makes her ſelf, <hi>the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Miſtreſs of all others,</hi> and that ſhe has alſo made it to be defined in her Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> It is upon that account, that one of her Popes, <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, formerly determined, <hi>That it was neceſſary to the Salvation of every creature, to be ſubject to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome. But clearly to decide ſo weighty a Queſtion, there ſeems to me to be only theſe two wayes: The firſt is, to enquire, whether that Church can, or cannot fall into Error, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97749:164"/>
ceaſe to be the True Church of Jeſus Chriſt; for if it be true, that ſhe can never fall into Errors, nor loſe the quality of a true Church, we muſt conclude, that we ought alwayes to remain in her Communion. But if on the contrary, ſhe may erre, and ceaſe to be a true Church, we muſt alſo conclude, that we may and ought to ſeparate our ſelves, when there ſhall be a juſt occaſion there. The ſecond way is, that, laying aſide the Queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe may err or not, we examine, whether it be true, that God has made her the Miſtreſs of all other Churches as ſhe pretends, whether he has eſtabliſhed her to be the perpetual and inviolable Center of the Chriſtian Unity, with a command to all the faithful not to fly off from her. For if it be an Order that God has made, we cannot reſiſt it, without deſtroying our ſelves; but if it be only an ill-grounded pretenſion of that Church, her communion is neither more neceſſary, nor more inviolable, than that of other particular Churches.</p>
               <p>But as to the firſt of theſe wayes, I have already ſhewn, that it engages thoſe who will follow it in the examination of the foundation; and in effect, the proofs that they ſet before us to eſtabliſh the Infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, are neither ſo clear, nor ſo concluding, that it ſhould not be neceſſary to ſee, whether the Doctrines that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches, anſwer that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which ſhe makes to be infallible, and unable to fall away; or to ſay better, thoſe proofs are ſo weak, and ſo trivial, that they themſelves bind us to have recourſe to the examination of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of that Church, to judge of her pretenſion by them. Theſe two Arguments are equally good as to their form. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot err in the Faith; therefore the things which ſhe teaches us of Faith, are true. And the things which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches us are not true; therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may err. I do not here examine the queſtion, which of theſe two wayes of reaſoning is the more natural. I yield if they will, that they ſhould chuſe the firſt; but when they ſhall have choſe it, good ſenſe would alſo require, that if the things which they ſhall ſet before us, to prove this Propoſition, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>cannot err in the faith,</hi> do no wayes ſatisfie the mind, if inſtead of aſſuring us, they plunge us into the greateſt uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we muſt paſs over to the other way; and by conſequence we muſt enter into the examination of the foundation. But to judge of what nature thoſe proofs are which they give for the infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we need but a naked view
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97749:165"/>
of them. For they are not the expreſs declarations of the will of God, although it ſhould be very neceſſary that they ſhould have ſuch a one for the eſtabliſhment of ſo great and peculiar a priviledge, the knowledge of which, is ſo very important to all Chriſtians. They are not evident conſequences drawn from ſome paſſages of Scripture, or ſome actions of the Apoſtles: they are neither clear and convincing reaſonings, nor even ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, and ſuch as have much likelihood. They are ſtrained conſequences, which they draw as they are able, from two or three paſſages of the Scripture, and which a man that ſhould have never heard them ſpeak of that Infallibility, with all his circumſpection would not have gathered.</p>
               <p>They produce the Teſtimony that St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in his dayes, <hi>That her faith was ſpoken of through all the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>world;</hi> and they conſider not, that he gives the ſame teſtimony to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> in far higher terms, than to the <hi>Romans;</hi> for he tells them, <hi>That they were an example to the faithful, and that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the word of the Lord ſounded from them, not only in</hi> Macedonia <hi>and</hi> Achaia, <hi>but in every place alſo.</hi> Although they do not conclude the infallibility of the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> from thence. They do not ſee that he renders well near the ſame teſtimony to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> in adding a clauſe that ſeems much more expreſs; to wit, <hi>That he is aſſured of this very thing, that he which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>a good work in them, would perform it until the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Although they cannot notwithſtanding conclude infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility from thence in the behalf of the Church of <hi>Philippi.</hi> In effect, theſe teſtimonies only regard the perſons, who at that time compoſed thoſe Churches, and not thoſe who ſhould come after them; and do not found any priviledge on them.</p>
               <p>They produce the paſſages of the Goſpel, that relate to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> as this, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it:</hi> and this, <hi>I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> 
                  <hi>bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. and this, <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; when therefore thou art converted,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 21.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtrengthen thy brethren:</hi> and this, <hi>Feed my ſheep.</hi> But to perceive the weakneſs of the conſequence which they draw from theſe paſſages, we need but to ſee that which is between two things, of which it is neceſſary that we ſhould be aſſured, before we can conclude any thing. Firſt of all, we muſt be aſſured, that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he preached and fixed his See there; for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97749:165"/>
theſe actions are not ſo evident as they imagine; they are inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped with divers difficulties that appear unconquerable, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many circumſtances that have no appearance of truth, and which make at leaſt that whole Hiſtory to be doubted. I confeſs, that the Ancients did believe ſo; but they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times readily admitted Fables for truths; and after all, theſe are matters of fact whereof we have not any Divine Revelation, about which, according to the very principle of our Adverſaries, all the whole Church may be deceived; and which by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence are not of faith, nor can ſerve as a foundation for an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ſo much concerning the faith as this is. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot err, and that it is alwayes neceſſary to ſalvation to be in her communion. Secondly, We muſt be aſſured that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> are the True and ordinary Succeſſors of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Government of every Chriſtian Church. For why ſhould not they be his Succeſſors in the Government of the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as the Biſhops of <hi>Antioch</hi> in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Government of that of <hi>Antioch?</hi> When the Apoſtles preached in thoſe places, where they gathered Churches and ſetled Paſtors, they did not intend that thoſe Paſtors after them ſhould receive all the rights of their Apoſtleſhip, nor that they ſhould be Univerſal Biſhops. They ſay, that there muſt have been one, and that that could have been in no other Church, but that where S. <hi>Peter</hi> dy'd: But all this is ſaid without any ground. The Church is a Kingdom that acknowledges none beſides Jeſus Chriſt for its Monarch; he is our only Lord, and our Soveraign Teacher; and after that the Apoſtles had formed Churches, and that the Chriſtian Religion had been laid down in the Books of the New Teſtament, the Paſtors had in thoſe Divine Books, the exact Rule of their Preaching and their Government. Thoſe who have applyed themſelves only to that, have alwayes well governed their Flocks, without ſtanding in need of that pretended Univerſal Epiſcopacy, which is a Chimerical Office, more proper to ruine Religion, than to preſerve it. In the Third place, we muſt be aſſured, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf had received in thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages ſome peculiar dignity, that had raiſed him above the other Apoſtles, and ſome rights which were not common to all of them. But this is what they cannot conclude from thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited paſſages: for granting that Jeſus Chriſt has built his Church upon S. <hi>Peter,</hi> has he not alſo built it upon the other Apoſtles? is it not elſewhere written, <hi>That we are built upon the foundations of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:97749:166"/>
                  <hi>the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone?</hi> Is it not written, <hi>That the</hi> New Jeruſalem <hi>has twelve foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>wherein the names of the twelve Apoſtles of the Lamb are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?</hi> If Jeſus Chriſt has prayed for the perſeverance of the faith of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> has he not made the ſame Prayer for all the other, <hi>Keep them,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>in thine own name, that they may be one, as we are?</hi>

                  <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> In the Fourth place, we muſt be aſſured, that when there ſhould be in all thoſe paſſages ſome peculiar priviledge for S. <hi>Peter</hi> excluſive from the reſt of the Apoſtles, that it is a thing that could be tranſmitted down to his Succeſſors, and not ſome perſonal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge that reſided in him alone, and muſt have dyed with him. For can we not ſay, that the twelve Apoſtles, being the twelve foundations of the Church, the priviledge of S. <hi>Peter</hi> is to be firſt in order, becauſe he was the firſt who laboured in the converſion of the Jews at the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and in that of the Gentiles in the Sermon that he made to <hi>Cornelius?</hi> May we not ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt has particularly prayed for his perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the faith, becauſe that he alone had been winnowed by the Temptation that hapned to him in the Court of the High Prieſt? That he ſaid to him alone, <hi>When thou art converted, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thy brethren,</hi> becauſe that he alone had given a ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of humane weakneſs? That he ſaid to him thrice, <hi>Feed my ſheep</hi> or <hi>my lambs,</hi> becauſe that he only having thrice denyed his Maſter by words full of horror and ingratitude, our Lord would for his conſolation and re-eſtabliſhment, thrice pronounce words full of love and goodneſs? In fine, when thoſe Texts ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a peculiar priviledge, that might be communicated to the Succeſſors of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> we muſt be aſſured, that that priviledge muſt be the perpetual infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a certainty of never falling away from the quality of a True Church. And this is that which they know not how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97749:166"/>
from thoſe paſſages. for in reſpect of the firſt, The Church may have been built upon S. <hi>Peter</hi> and upon his firſt Succeſſors and remain firm and unſhaken upon thoſe foundations, that is to ſay, upon their Doctrine and Example, although in the courſe of ſome Ages the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have degenerated, and changed the faith of their Predeceſſors, and the words of Jeſus Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended even to the Succeſſors of S. <hi>Peter</hi> would not be leſs true, when they ſhould not extend themſelves unto all thoſe who bear that name. S. <hi>Paul</hi> has called the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in the midſt of which, <hi>Timothy</hi> his Diſciple was, when he wrote his firſt Epiſtle to him; he has I ſay, called them <hi>the pillar and ground of Truth.</hi> For <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.</note> although thoſe Titles belong in general to every Church, it is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding certain, that they regard more directly and more particularly that part of the Univerſal Church, I would ſay the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> where <hi>Timothy</hi> reſided when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to him. But the word of this Apoſtle does not fail to be true, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the courſe of many Ages thoſe Churches have degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their firſt purity, and though the Succeſſors of <hi>Timothy</hi> loſt it very quickly after. And as to the Prayer that Jeſus Chriſt made to God, that the faith of S. <hi>Peter</hi> might not fail, when they would extend it down to his Succeſſors, they cannot conclude a greater Infallibility for them, than that of S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, who preſerving his faith concealed at the bottom of his heart, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly denyed his Maſter three times; and who, according to the opinion of our Adverſaries, loſt entirely his love, and had fallen from a ſtate of Grace, being no more either in the Communion of God, nor in that of the Myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> therefore call her ſelf infallible as much as ſhe pleaſes, in vertue of the Prayer of Jeſus Chriſt, that Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility will not hinder, but that ſhe may externally deny the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, but that ſhe may intirely loſe her love, and the communion of our Saviour, and the quality of the True Church, and by conſequence, that we ſhould not be bound to ſeparate from her, while ſhe ſhould be in that ſtate, and till it ſhould pleaſe God to re-eſtabliſh her.</p>
               <p>See here of what force thoſe proofs are which they produce to ground this ſpecial priviledge of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon. It is not hard to ſee, that a man of good underſtanding, who would ſatisfie his mind and his conſcience upon ſo weighty a point, ought not to remain there; but that he ought to paſs on to the other way of clearing that doubt which I have noted,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97749:167"/>
which is, to judge of the pretenſion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the examination of her Doctrines and her Worſhip. For it is there principally that the characters of truth and infallibility ought to be found, and by conſequence he muſt come to the foundation, and no further amuſe himſelf with Prejudices.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond Way, by which I have ſaid we might clear this Queſtion, Whether it be neceſſary to the ſalvation of Chriſtians, to be joyned to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> it conſiſts in examining, whether it be true, that God has made her the Miſtreſs of all other Churches? whether there is any particular order that binds us indiſpenſably to her? For if that be ſo, the Separation of our Fathers muſt be condemned; but if it be not ſo, we muſt judge of that Church as of all other particular Churches, and ſay, that we cannot and ought not to ſeparate our ſelves from her, but when we have juſt and lawful cauſes ſo to do. There is no perſon who does not judge, that we cannot paſs over lightly a point of ſo great importance, which ought to ſerve for a general and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Rule to all Chriſtians; and that if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would ſo ſet her ſelf beyond a ſtate of equality above other Churches, it is neceſſary that ſhe ſhould produce ſome very expreſs and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputable Order of God for it. But inſtead of that, ſhe does nothing but reverberate the ſame paſſages which I have mentioned. She boaſts her ſelf to be the See of S. <hi>Peter;</hi> and under that pretence, ſhe applyes to her ſelf all that ſhe can find in the Scripture in favour of that Apoſtle; and particularly the Order that Jeſus Chriſt gave him to feed his ſheep, as if the Office of the Apoſtleſhip, in which Jeſus Chriſt re-eſtabliſhed him by thoſe words, could be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to his Succeſſors; or as if the foundation that Jeſus Chriſt ſuppoſed, and upon which he re-eſtabliſhed him, in ſaying to him <hi>feed my ſheep,</hi> to wit, <hi>that he ſhould love him more than the reſt,</hi> was not a thing purely perſonal in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and whereof it was not in his power to tranſmit any part to his Succeſſors, nor by conſequence, to inveſt them with his Office, which was reſtored to him only upon a ſuppoſition of that love; or laſtly, as if the office of feeding Chriſt's ſheep, included an abſolute and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable neceſſity for the ſheep to receive their death, when they ſhould give it them under the name of their food.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledg'd, that there never was a higher pretenſion than this of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for what more could ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, then to make Heaven it ſelf depend on her communion, and to leave no poſſibility of ſalvation to any but thoſe who
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97749:167"/>
ſhould be in her communion, and under her dependance! But it muſt alſo be acknowledged, that there never was any thing worſe eſtabliſhed than that pretenſion. They alledge in its favour, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is clear and diſtinct; and even the conſequences which they draw for it, are made after a very ſtrange manner. This is, in my judgement, the Reaſon why our Adverſaries when they treat of this matter do not inſiſt much upon Scripture, but fly off preſently to the Fathers, and the uſage of the Ancient Church: For by this means, they hope to prolong the diſpute to eternity, and that notwithſtanding, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be alwayes in poſſeſſion of that Deſpotical Authority which ſhe exerciſes over the Churches that remain in her communion. In effect, the life of a man would ſcarce ſuffice to read well and throughly examine all the Volumes which have been compoſed on one ſide and on the other upon this Queſtion of the place that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and its Biſhops have held among the Chriſtian Churches du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the firſt ſix Centuries, and of the Authority which they had then. But to ſay the truth, there is too much artifice in that procedure; for that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be the Miſtreſs of all others, and that no one could be ſaved but in her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that does not depend upon the order of men, but only on that of God: and when they ſhould find among the Antients a thouſand times more complaiſance for the See of <hi>Rome</hi> than they had, that may very well eſtabliſh an ancient poſſeſſion, and make clear the fact; but it can never eſtabliſh the right of it. To eſtabliſh a right of that nature, a word of God, an expreſs decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his will is neceſſary; for it is a right not only above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but even above the ordinary and common favour that God gives to other Churches, and which by conſequence depends only upon God. And ſo it is but a wandring from the way, to go to ſearch for the grounds of it in the Writings of Men. It is no hard matter to conceive, that thoſe Biſhops which were raiſed to Dignities in the Metropolis of the World, and engaged in the greateſt affairs, might mannage matters ſo, as to aſcribe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thoſe rights which no wayes belonged to them, nor to imagine that their flatterers and Courtiers might not have offered more incenſe to them than they ought, nor that thoſe perſecuted ones who had recourſe to their protection, might not have helped the increaſe of their Authority, nor that the Princes and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors who had need of them, might not have given them thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which they ought not to have had, that which renders to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97749:168"/>
a juſt title, all that which they alledge in their favour ſuſpected and to no purpoſe at all.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding there are moreover, evident matters of fact, that let us clearly ſee, that the Ancient Church did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that Univerſal Epiſcopacy, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> pretend to, nor that abſolute and indiſpenſable neceſſity to be joyned to their See to be ſaved, nor that their Church ſhould be the Miſtreſs of all the reſt. 1. Every one knows, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were anciently choſen by the ſuffrages of the people and of the Clergy of that Church, without any other Churches taking part in thoſe Elections, which is a mark manifeſt enough, that they did not mean, that thoſe Biſhops ſhould be Univerſal Biſhops, nor that they ſhould have a more peculiar intereſt in their creation, than in that of other Biſhops. Since the Popes were raiſed to that high Dignity wherein we behold them at this day, each Nation has thought, that it ought in ſome manner to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate in their Nomination, becauſe the buſineſs was about one common intereſt, they would have the Protectors of their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts in the Colledge of Cardinals, and Princes themſelves have interpos'd; but they can ſee nothing like that in the Primitive Church. <hi>Rome</hi> alone made her Biſhops without the participation of other Churches. 2. <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> having excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> who celebrated the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> after the manner of the Jews, S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> with the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> oppoſed themſelves to that Excommunication, and wrote as well to <hi>Victor</hi> as to the other Biſhops, and in effect thoſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 24.</note> Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> did not ceaſe to remain in the Communion of the Catholick Church, notwithſtanding that action of <hi>Victor,</hi> as it appears from the Teſtimony of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who formally ſayes, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Socrat. hiſt. Eccl. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> that thoſe who contended about the buſineſs of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> did not nevertheleſs refuſe communion with one another. So that their Biſhops were called and received in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficulty; for <hi>Euſebius</hi> notes expreſly, among thoſe who <note place="margin">

Epiſt. de Synod. Arim. &amp; Sel.</note> that all the World was aſſembled at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that the <hi>Syrians</hi> came to the ſame opinion with the reſt,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97749:168"/>
and that they earneſtly contended againſt the Hereſie of <hi>Arius,</hi> which ſhews us, that they aſſiſted at the Council, without any notice being taken of <hi>Victor</hi>'s Excommunication. From whence it is no very hard matter to conclude, what <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 288.</note> of <hi>Sienna,</hi> and afterwards Pope, has acknowledged in one of his Letters, <hi>That before the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>every one lived according to his own wayes, and that men had but a very ſmall regard to the Church of</hi> Rome. 3. In the ſixth Century, a great trouble being raiſed in the Church, upon the occaſion of three Writings; the one of <hi>Theodoret</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the other of <hi>Ibas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> and the third of <hi>Theodoret</hi> of <hi>Mopſueſta,</hi> which had been read and approved in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> but whom the moſt judged to be Heretical, Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> openly took up the deſence of thoſe three Writings, and vigorouſly oppos'd himſelf to the condemnation that the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> and the Eaſtern Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs had made of them. But, in the end, being drawn to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> he changed his opinion, and conſented to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, whither he was carried out to it by the complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance which he had for the Emperour, who had a great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for that buſineſs, or whether out of ſome other principle. Howſoever it were, that action appear'd ſo criminal in the eyes of a great number of Orthodox Biſhops, that they ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Churches from the Communion of <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his Party, and even the Church of <hi>Africa</hi> aſſembled in Council, as <hi>Victor</hi> of <hi>Tunis</hi> an <hi>African</hi> Biſhop witneſſes, who lived in thoſe <note place="margin">Victor. Tunun. in Chron.</note> times, Synodically excommunicated that Pope, leaving him not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding means to re-eſtabliſh himſelf by repentance. Theſe Actions prove in my judgement, very ſufficiently, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then did not look upon the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as the Miſtreſs of all others, nor on the communion or dependance on its See, as a thing abſolutely neceſſary to the ſalvation of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>There can nothing be ſaid in effect more oppoſite to the Spirit of the Chriſtian Religion, than that Imagination. God had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore fixed his Communion with that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and in its High Prieſts, the center of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Unity. But when Jeſus Chriſt brought his Goſpel into the world, he changed that order, not by tranſporting the rights of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> nor thoſe of the High Prieſts to the Popes; but by aboliſhing wholly that neceſſity of Communion to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, and that particular dependance on a certain See. This is what S. <hi>Paul</hi> clearly enough teaches in his third Chapter of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97749:169"/>
Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians. In the new man,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>there is neither Greek nor Jew, neither Circumciſion nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, neither Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian or Scythian, bond or free, but Jeſus Chriſt is all, and in all.</hi> He had had no reaſon to expreſs himſelf after that manner, if that new man whereof he ſpoke, had neceſſarily been a <hi>Roman,</hi> and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the Communion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> So alſo the ſame Apoſtle ſetting that Evangelical Church that Jeſus Chriſt had aſſembled in oppoſition to the ancient and earthly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> makes not that oppoſition to conſiſt in this, that the one is <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and the other <hi>Rome;</hi> the one the head City of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and the other, that of the Empire; but he makes it to conſiſt in this, that one is earthly, and the other heavenly; the one below, and the other on high; the one ty'd to a certain place, from whence it cannot go; and the other independent on all manner of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular places in the world, and having no neceſſary dependence on any but Heaven. For it is to this purpoſe that he calls, <hi>the Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem that is above, the heavenly Jeruſalem, the City of the living God, the Church of the firſt-born, whoſe names are written in heaven.</hi> It is in <note place="margin">Gal. 4. Heb. 12.</note> the view of that, that Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Samaritan Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this mountain, nor</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 4. 1. 21, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>yet at Jeruſalem worſhip the Father: But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> The <hi>Samaritans</hi> would eſtabliſh the center of Religion on the Mountain where <hi>Jacob</hi> and the twelve Patriarchs had built an Altar to God; the Jews, on the contrary eſtabliſhed it in the City of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> To all that Jeſus Chriſt oppoſes not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City, as the new Mountain which he had choſen; nor <hi>Rome</hi> as another <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit and the Truth;</hi> that is to ſay, Faith and Piety alone, abſtracted from all thoſe relations to particular places, and independent on all Cities and Mountains.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing is juſtified by the cenſure that S. <hi>Paul</hi> paſſed on the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in that one ſaid, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, another <hi>I am of</hi> Apollos, and another <hi>I am of</hi> Cephas, that is to ſay, of <hi>Peter.</hi> For we ought not to imagine, that thoſe men meant, that they were ſo of <hi>Paul,</hi> or of <hi>Apollos,</hi> or of <hi>Peter,</hi> as to be no more of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note> Jeſus Chriſt; or that they would take <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas</hi> for heads equal to Jeſus Chriſt. They were Chriſtians, and they were not ignorant of the difference they were to make between Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles. No, without doubt, they were not ignorant of it, but they would have ſubordinate heads, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane heads, on whom they might depend by an external depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97749:169"/>
and that was neceſſary for them to be, by that means linked to Jeſus Chriſt, after the ſame manner that they would have us at this day to depend on the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherefore did S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay to them; <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi> Why did he not ſay to them, that as for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> they had no reaſon to take them for their heads, but that it was far otherwiſe as to <hi>Peter,</hi> ſince God had ſet up him and his Succeſſors for ever to be the heads of the Univerſal Church? Why in ſtead of that, did he conclude after this manner, <hi>That no one ſhould glory in men: for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. v. 21, 22, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>all things are yours, whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollos, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or the world; or life or death; or things preſent; or things to come; all are yours; and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods?</hi> Is it not to let them underſtand, that Jeſus Chriſt is the only head of the Church, that there is only his communion that is abſolutely neceſſary; and that as for other Miniſters, whoſoever they were, they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for our uſe, as all other things, to ſerve us, in as much as they lead us to Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>If the Church under the New Teſtament, ought to be invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably ty'd to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> how ſhould the Scripture have been ſilent in ſo weighty a truth, which could not be ignor'd without extream danger, nor conteſted without evident damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Notwithſtanding, we do not find any other head of the Church in thoſe Sacred Books but Jeſus Chriſt, nor any other High Prieſt but him. We do not find in the Scripture any Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Biſhop, nor Miniſterial head, or ſubordinate, or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church the Miſtreſs of all others. We find there indeed that Jeſus Chriſt being aſcended up on high, gave ſome to be Apoſtles, others to be Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> and Teachers, for the aſſembling of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt. How came the Apoſtle to forget in that Enumeration, the chief of all Offices, to wit, that of the Miniſterial Head of the whole Church, and the Univerſal Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, in <hi>the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and conduct of his flock? If the Chriſtian Church ought in that to reſemble the Synagogue, and to have as that, a Soveraign High Prieſt upon earth, who ſhould be the head of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and who ſhould have his Succeſſors as the ancient High Prieſt had: whence comes it, that the Scripture has alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded that Ancient High Prieſt as a Figure of Jeſus Chriſt, that it alwayes referred it to him, and never to the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, nor even to S. <hi>Peter</hi> who was then alive, and who ſhould by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97749:170"/>
have exerciſed that pretended charge which they would make to deſcend from him?</p>
               <p>There is therefore no lawful foundation in all that pretenſion of <hi>Rome</hi> and her See. We ought to paſs the ſame judgement on all other Sees and other particular Churches, with which it is juſt we ſhould hold communion, while they teach good and ſound Doctrine, and that we ſhould even bear with them, when they ſhould fall into ſome errors, provided they conſtrain no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to believe them: but from which it is alſo juſt to ſeparate our ſelves, when they ſhall fall into errors contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Jeſus Chriſt our only Saviour, and when they would violently force all others to believe the ſame. If in a long courſe of Ages, <hi>Rome</hi> has uſurped by little and little the rights that do not belong to her, if ſhe has found it very eaſie, through the ignorance, or complaiſance of men, in the diverſe intrigues of the World, to raiſe her Throne as high as our Fathers beheld it, and as we do yet at this day: If her flatterers have not failed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to raiſe her pretenſions as high as Heaven, and if ſhe has been lull'd aſleep with the ſound of thoſe ſweet charms that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant her, we do not believe, that that ought to prejudice our ſeparation. We have no other averſion for her communion, than that which our conſcience gives us; and if it ſhall pleaſe God to re-eſtabliſh her in her ancient purity, ſhe would not have ſo great a joy to ſpread forth her arms to us, as we ſhould have an impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to demand her peace of her. But as long as we ſhall ſee her in that bad ſtate wherein we are perſwaded ſhe is, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but bewail and pray for her, and yet notwithſtanding no body can blame us, for preferring our own ſalvation to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>

               <p>BEfore we leave this matter of our Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there yet remains two Queſtions for us to examine; the one, Whether our Fathers were not too precipitate in ſo great an affair, whether they did not act with too much haſte, or Whether they had ſufficient motives from the conduct of thoſe from whom they ſeparated, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake in the end their communion: The other, Whether with all that, they can ſay, that they ſeparated themſelves from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Catholick Church ſpread over the whole World, as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did heretofore, and whether they did not fall into the ſame crime with thoſe ancient Schiſmaticks, againſt whom <hi>Optatus</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſo ſtrongly diſputed. I will treat of this ſecond Queſtion in the following Chapter, and this here ſhall be deſign'd to the clearing of the former.</p>
               <p>To effect this, methinks, we need but freely to ſet before their eyes all that I have ſaid in the ſecond Part, touching the neceſſity that lay upon our Fathers to reform themſelves. For ſince it clearly reſults from thoſe matters of fact which I have ſet down, that the Popes and thoſe of their party were ſo far from applying themſelves ſeriouſly to a Reformation, that they ſtudied on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, only how to ſtifle the truth from the very firſt moment they beheld it appear, and to defend their Errors and Superſtitions by all manner of wayes, who ſees not that that inflexible reſolution which had not yielded either to the firſt or ſecond admonition, rendred from that time the ſeparation of our Fathers juſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted them from all reproach? For when there are Errors ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of giving ground for a ſeparation, it ought to be defer'd only upon a hope of amendment, and that hope ſeem'd to be ſufficiently deſtroy'd, by thoſe Hiſtorical actions which I have already ſet down.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, to ſhew them more and more, how the conduct of our Fathers was very prudent in that reſpect, and full
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97749:171"/>
of circumſpection, it will not be beſides our purpoſe, to reſume here the cloſe of their ſtory, from the unjuſt condemnation of <hi>Luther</hi> and his Doctrine made by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, down to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> after which we may ſay, that their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was full and entire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> therefore having been excommunicated by the Popes Bull, with all thoſe who ſhould follow his Doctrine, after the manner that we have ſeen, he appealed to a free Council, and propoſed the Cauſes of his appeal in a publick Declaration that he cauſed afterwards to be Printed, wherein with great humility he demanded of the Emperour, the Electors, the Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and in general of all the Powers of <hi>Germany,</hi> that they would joyn themſelves with him in his appeal; or at leaſt, that they would defer the Execution of the Bull, until having been lawfully called, and heard by equitable Judges, he ſhould be condemned. He proteſted, that in caſe his ſo juſt a demand <note place="margin">All that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Chapter, has been faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken out of four Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, to wit, <hi>Sleidan, The Hiſtory of the Council of</hi> Trent, of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul, Th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>anus</hi> and <hi>Raynaldus.</hi>
                  </note> ſhould be refuſed, and that they ſhould continue to obey the Pope rather than God, the conſciences of his perſecutors would remain chargeable before God's Tribunal.</p>
               <p>But thoſe who had already condemn'd him for a like appeal to a Council, did not leave off their proſecuting him for all that. The Pope did not fail to cauſe his Bull to be publiſh'd with great Solemnity, he added even in that which they call <hi>Coena Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> which is publiſhed every year, a new clauſe bearing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> and thoſe of his Sect. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in his firſt condemnation, he had given him threeſcore dayes time to recant, that term being expired, he pronounced a new and peremptory Excommunication againſt him, by which he curſed him and his followers eternally, and declared them guilty of Treaſon and Hereſie; he ſpoil'd them of all their Honours and Goods, and injoyn'd all Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Prelates, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to preach, or to ſtir up others to preach againſt them in all places. Notwithſtanding, he earneſtly ſolicited as well by his Letters as his Nuntio's, the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth and all the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> to employ all their Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers. Thoſe ſolicitations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them the Citation of <hi>Luther</hi> to the Aſſembly of <hi>Wormes,</hi> of which I have ſpoke in the ſecond Part and in the end, the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Edict, called the Edict of <hi>Wormes,</hi> which baniſh'd him from all the Lands of the Empire as a mad-man, poſſeſs'd with the Devil, a Devil clothed in humane ſhape, an Heretick, a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97749:171"/>
This Edict forbad him Fire and Water, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of all the World; and ordain'd that after the term of twenty dayes, he ſhould be taken and put into a ſtrong Priſon in order to be ſeverely puniſhed. But beſides all this, it carried this further in it, that it extended to all his favourers, followers and complices, and that his Books ſhould be publickly burn'd. <hi>Luther</hi> giving way to this furious ſtorm, withdrew himſelf for ſome time into a ſafe place, under the protection of <hi>John Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony;</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> after having excited all that Tragedy, dyed in the flower of his age, the firſt day of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> in the year 1521. But the hatred of the Reformation did not dye with him, he had for his Succeſſor as well in that hatred, as in his See, <hi>Adrian</hi> the Sixth, who was choſen the eighth of <hi>January</hi> 1522.</p>
               <p>After this new Pope had taken poſſeſſion of his Papacy, he ſent a <hi>Nuntio</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> and though as we have ſeen, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, he charged him in an expreſs Article, ſeriouſly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, before the Aſſembly of <hi>Nuremberg</hi> the diſorders both in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and in the whole Body of the Prelates, and the reſt of the Clergy; he did not fail nevertheleſs to charge him alſo at the ſame time, to denounce terrible threatnings againſt <hi>Luther</hi>'s followers: for ſo it was, that he called thoſe who then embraced the Reformation. He wrote with the ſame Spirit, publick and private Letters to the Princes and other States of the Empire who were aſſembled together; and he omitted nothing to ſtir them up to make uſe of Fire and Sword and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt violence on that occaſion. We may ſee thoſe Letters in <hi>Bzovius</hi> and <hi>Raynaldus,</hi> and find in them all the characters of an extream paſſion. He uſes there divers reaſons to animate them, taken from their honour and their own intereſts. He ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes the example of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> wherein <hi>John Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> were burn'd, that of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in inflicting death on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and that of God himſelf, who made the Earth ſwallow up <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of them, and ſharply cenſures them, in that they had not ſeverely put the Edict of <hi>Wormes</hi> in Execution; and to ſtir them up the more, he aſſures them, that the deſign of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> was to overthrow every Humane Order, to dethrone all the Princes, and to pillage all <hi>Germany,</hi> under a pretence of the Goſpel. He repeated the ſame things in his inſtructions to his <hi>Nuntio;</hi> and after having enjoyn'd him to repreſent to the Princes all that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97749:172"/>
might move him to extirpate thoſe pretended Hereticks, ſo far as to tell them, that they ought to imitate the generoſity of their Anceſtors, ſome of which had carried with their own hands <hi>John Huſſe</hi> to the Stake: he concludes with the words of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> when he propheſied the ruine of the <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> Infidels, and which this Pope applied againſt thoſe Chriſtians, <hi>Curſed is he that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 48. v. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>doth the work of the Lord negligently, and who keepeth back his ſword from blood.</hi> He wrote alſo to <hi>John Frederick</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> Letters full of heat, wherein after having made a bloody inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and his Doctrine, and having exhorted that Prince to abandon him, he fiercely threatens him, that if he do not do it, he ſhould feel the effects of his anger and that of the Emperours. <hi>I declare to thee,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>in the authority of God Almighty, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Vicar I am upon Earth, that thou ſhalt not go away unpuniſhed in this preſent world, and that everlaſting fire ſhall attend thee in the world to come. For we live at the ſame time together, both I</hi> Adrian <hi>Pope, and the Emperour</hi> Charles, <hi>whoſe truly Chriſtian Edict thou haſt contemned, which he made againſt the</hi> Lutheran <hi>Perfidiouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Letters wrought but a ſmall effect in the mind of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi> who was a pious Prince, and one that loved the Truth; but they did not alſo work much upon thoſe of the reſt of the Princes aſſembled at <hi>Nurenberg;</hi> and the anſwer which they made, deſerves to be ſet down. It contained well near theſe Articles, <hi>That they could not execute the Sentence of the Apoſtolick See againſt</hi> Luther, <hi>nor the Edict of</hi> Wormes, <hi>without incurring themſelves very great dangers. That the far greater part of the people had been for a long time perſwaded, that</hi> Germany <hi>ſuffer'd a great many troubles on the ſide of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>by reaſon of its abuſes, and that all the world was then fully inſtructed in it, by the Writings and Tenets of the</hi> Lutherans. <hi>That if they had rigorouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted the Popes Sentence and the Imperial Edict, the people would have believed, that it had been only made to overthrow the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and to maintain and defend their evils, abuſes and impieties. That it was very well done of</hi> Adrian, <hi>to acknowledge the diſorders of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>and that they earneſtly intreated him, for the glory of God, for the ſalvation of ſouls, and for the peace and tranquillity of the publick, ſeriouſly to put his hand to reform them. That they intreated him alſo to allow that the firſt fruits of Benefices which they had given to the Popes for them to employ againſt the</hi> Turks, <hi>and which his Predeceſſors had turned aſide to other uſes, ſhould for the time to come be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97749:172"/>
into the publick Treaſure of the Empire, to be made uſe of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their natural appointment. And as for the remedies which he required of them to put a ſtop to the courſe of the</hi> Lutheran <hi>error, that they ſaw none more proper, than ſpedily to call a free and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Council in ſome Town of</hi> Germany, <hi>wherein it might be allowed to every one, as well of the Clergy as of the Laity, to ſpeak freely, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all Oaths and contrary Obligations, and to take counſel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that which they ſhould judge to be good for the glory of God, for the ſalvation of Souls, and the advantage of the Chriſtian Commonwealth. That notwithſtanding, they would hinder</hi> Luther <hi>and his followers from writing any more, and they would give order that the Preachers ſhould teach nothing but the true, pure and ſincere Goſpel, according to the Doctrine and explication, received and approved in the Chriſtian Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Anſwer extreamly diſpleaſed the Popes Nuntio, he would not that they ſhould ſpeak of a free Council; for it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, he ſaid, <hi>That by that propoſition they would give Laws to the Pope.</hi> He approved yet leſs, that they ſhould touch upon the troubles of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the abuſes of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> he required nothing but fire and ſword againſt the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave them his reply in writing, in which he inſiſted, that the Sentence of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> and the Imperial Edict of <hi>Wormes,</hi> which Ordained, that they ſhould overthrow all the followers of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſhould be executed according to their form and tenour, without any diminution. And as to the demand of a Council, he ſaid, that they ſhould have made it in terms more reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which ſhould have given no grounds of jealouſie to the Pope, and that by thoſe clauſes, <hi>that the Council ſhould be free, and that men ſhould be abſolv'd from their Oaths,</hi> they ſeem'd to go about to bind the hands of his Holineſs. The Princes would notwithſtanding have nothing chang'd in their deliberation, which they cauſed to be drawn up in the form of an Imperial Edict, and ſent their Grievances to the Pope, to the number of a hundred Articles, which they called <hi>Centum gravamina. Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldus</hi> reckons up only ſeventy ſeven upon the teſtimony of <hi>Dolgaſtus.</hi> However it were, thoſe Griefs explained one part of the diſorders that reigned then in the Government of the Church, and under which, not only <hi>Germany,</hi> but all the reſt of the Weſt groaned.</p>
               <p>Thus it came to paſs, that the endeavours of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and its Partizans to raiſe a perſecution againſt thoſe who
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97749:173"/>
demanded a Reformation were to no purpoſe for that time But what they could not obtain at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> they obtained elſewhere; for in that ſame year, they cauſed two <hi>Auguſtin</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1523.</note> Monks accuſed of <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> to be burn'd alive, who ſuffer'd that puniſhment with an admirable conſtancy; and at <hi>Anvers</hi> they made a Covent of the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Friars be pull'd down to the ground, the Prior of which, named <hi>Henry Suphanus</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffer'd death in the preceding year for the ſame cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adrian</hi> enjoyed the Papacy but one year and eight months or thereabouts; for he was raiſed to it, as I have ſaid, the eighth of <hi>January</hi> 1522. and he dyed the thirteenth of <hi>September</hi> 1523. his Succeſſor was <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh: This man marching after the ſteps of his Predeceſſors, was not well ſetled in the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Chair, before he turned all his thoughts againſt thoſe whom they called <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and to that effect, having been advertis'd, that the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> had bound themſelves to meet again at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> he ſent thither Cardinal <hi>Campeius</hi> in the quality of his Legate. Notwithſtanding he wrote to the Emperour, who was then in <hi>Spain,</hi> earneſtly ſoliciting him to employ his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to make the Edict of <hi>Wormes</hi> to be put in Execution in his Empire, and to diſpoſe the Princes to it. His Legate being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> vehemently inſiſted upon the Extirpation of the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and he made for that purpoſe, divers Orations in the Aſſembly. But the Princes would not follow his violent courſes; they on the contrary, obſtinately demanded a free Council in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ordained, that each Prince and each State ſhould, while they waited for that Council, call together within their Juriſdictions, their Learned, Wiſe and Pious men, to examine the new Tenets of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and to ſeparate the good from the bad in them; and to examine alſo the complaints of their Nation againſt the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and its Clergy. They added nevertheleſs, that each one on his part, ſhould do what he could to make the Edict of <hi>Wormes</hi> to be executed; and that in fine, that to conclude ſomething firm, the States of the Empire ſhould meet together within a certain time at <hi>Spire.</hi> This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration which was afterwards drawn up and publiſh'd in the form of an Imperial Edict, extreamly provok'd the Pope and all his creatures. They complain'd of this, that in expectation of a Council, they would ſubmit the matters of Religion to the judgement of a few Wiſe, Learned and Pious perſons, ſaying, <hi>that it was the means to ſpread abroad every where the poyſon of</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:97749:173"/>
                  <hi>Hereſie;</hi> for thus <hi>Raynaldus</hi> relates it. They could not endure the propoſition of a free Council; but above all things, they loudly cry'd out of this, that under that pretence, they would defer the execution of the Popes Sentence and the Edict of <hi>Wormes</hi> againſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> whoſe blood and deſtruction they only demanded. <hi>Clement</hi> made great complaints to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, by the Letters which he ſent him into <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein to animate him the more, he perſwaded him, that that was a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt breach of his Authority, and a formed deſign to withdraw themſelves intirely from his obedience; and as theſe ſolicitations were extreamly vehement and urgent; they forced the Emperour to write into <hi>Germany</hi> to the Princes, and to all the States of the Empire, that it was his intention that they ſhould punctually execute his Edict of <hi>Wormes,</hi> that they ſhould make that of <hi>Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> void, and forbad them to hold the Diet of <hi>Spire.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Letters came to <hi>Germany,</hi> the Legat <hi>Campeius</hi> had drawn off one part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Princes, for the moſt part Eccleſiaſticks, and having made them to meet at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> under a pretence of a ſhadow of Reformation that he had propounded, which conſiſted only in moſt trivial matters, he cauſed them to make a League among them for the defence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the deſtruction of the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> Soon after, they ſaw the effects of this League appear; for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the Legat being gone into <hi>Auſtria,</hi> they condemned to death ſome perſons upon the account of Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clement</hi> elſewhere took the ſame cares for all places, which they took in <hi>Germany,</hi> to hinder the progreſs of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He wrote upon that ſubject into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> into <hi>Bohemia, France, Poland, Swedeland, Denmark;</hi> and he ſtirr'd up every where the Princes, Magiſtrates and Prelates, to overthrow the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Wherefore they beheld ſoon after under his Pontificate, the Inquiſitions taken up in that purſuit, the Priſons filled with Priſoners, and the Scaffolds and the Stakes filled almoſt generally in all places that owned his Authority. It was at this time that <hi>Antonius Pratenſis</hi> Cardinal and Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> held a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synod at <hi>Paris,</hi> the ninety ſecond Article of which was framed in theſe terms: <hi>We intreat the Moſt Chriſtian King our Prince and Soveraign Lord, by the bowels of the mercies of God, that according to his ſingular zeal and incredible devotion for the Chriſtian Religion, that he would ſuddenly baniſh from the Lands of his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction all Hereticks, and that he would extirpate that deadly and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97749:174"/>
plague, which increaſes every day more and more.</hi> The ninety third was framed after this manner; <hi>Therefore it is, that the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Princes, if they would have any care for the Chriſtian Name, and would hinder the ruine of Religion, ought neceſſarily to uſe all their endeavours to extirpate and deſtroy Hereticks.</hi> That Arch-Biſhop was very much intereſſed in the preſervation of the ancient abuſes: for we find in the Dialogue of the Two Pariſhioners of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial.</hi> 1.</note> S. <hi>Hilary Montanus,</hi> that he was Cardinal, Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alby,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gap,</hi> and Abbot of <hi>Fleury.</hi> We ought not to be aſtoniſhed if he declaimed ſo much againſt the Reformation: He was in effect one of thoſe who oppoſed themſelves to it in <hi>France,</hi> with the greateſt heat; and if any would know his character, they need but look to that which the Authors of that ſame Dialogue ſay of him. <hi>This</hi> Du Prat, <hi>was he not as great a Prelate, as a S.</hi> Hilary <hi>of</hi> Poictiers, <hi>a S.</hi> Martin <hi>of</hi> Tours, <hi>a S.</hi> German <hi>of</hi> Auxerre, <hi>and as a S.</hi> Lupus <hi>of</hi> Troye? <hi>He had alone full as many Biſhopricks as all thoſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Saints had together, and moreover the Abby in which is the Body of S.</hi> Benoriſt; <hi>but he has not done ſo many Miracles as all thoſe Saints; and he never reſided in any of thoſe Dioceſſes, nor ever perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any other office of a Biſhop, than that only Ordinance againſt</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther, Philip Melancthon, Oecolampadins, Zuinghus; <hi>for as yet</hi> Calvin <hi>and</hi> Beza <hi>were not talked of. It is this good Prelate to whom they attribute the taking away of the</hi> Pragmatick Sanction, <hi>that is to ſay, the pure obſervation of the Ancient Canons of the Church of</hi> France, <hi>and the having made the agreement between King</hi> Francis <hi>the Firſt and</hi> Leo <hi>the Tenth, which has deſtroyed all the Apoſtolical Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in</hi> France, <hi>and aboliſhed the Canonical Elections, and ſubjected</hi> France <hi>to a deplorable ſervitude.</hi> The ſame Spirit that the Cardinal <hi>Du Prat</hi> had brought into <hi>France,</hi> reigned then in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Flanders, Auſtria, Poland,</hi> and univerſally in all places where the Power of the Pope extended it ſelf; for there was nothing talked of there, but the extream puniſhments, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on thoſe pretended Hereticks; and their very Judges who touch'd with ſome compaſſion, did not readily do their duty, according to the humour of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> did not remain unpuniſhed. For it was for this reaſon, that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Cardinal <hi>Campeius</hi> his Legate, to remove thoſe Inquiſitors, who were in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and to put others in their places, who ſhould better acquit themſelves of ſo deteſtable a ſervice as <hi>Raynaldus</hi> relates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:97749:174"/>
But while they acted after this manner, the Light of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation did yet ſpread it ſelf abroad in divers places through an admirable bleſſing of God, who has alwayes made the aſhes of his Martyrs, the ſeed of his Church. For not only <hi>Saxony</hi> had receiv'd it, but alſo a great part of <hi>Germany,</hi> a great part of <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland, Swedeland, Denmark, Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Livonia</hi> alſo. In the month of <hi>April</hi> in the year 1529. an Aſſembly of the Princes and other States of <hi>Germany</hi> was held at <hi>Spire,</hi> whither <hi>Clement</hi> did not fail to ſend a <hi>Nuntio:</hi> The firſt thing they did there, was to reject the Aſſembly at the City of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> under a pretence, that it had aboliſh'd the uſe of the Maſs, without waiting for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Diet. This violent procedure was quickly after followed by a Decree, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and ſome other Princes who took part with the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> made, and whom the Emperour had expreſly choſen for his Deputy Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. They ordain'd therefore in the firſt place, <hi>that thoſe who till then had obſerv'd the Edict of</hi> Wormes, that is to ſay, who not only had not receiv'd the Reformation, but who had perſecuted it with all their might, <hi>ſhould for the future do the like, and force their Subjects to do the ſame; and that as for thoſe in whoſe Countreys that new Doctrine had been ſpread abroad, provided they could not extirpate it, without putting themſelves into a manifeſt danger of ſtirring up troubles, it ſhould be their part at leaſt, to hinder any thing more from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novated, till the calling of a Council.</hi> Secondly, They ordained, <hi>That above all things, the Doctrine which oppoſed the ſubſtantial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, ſhould neither be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, nor propounded by any in all the compaſs of</hi> Germany, <hi>and that the Maſs ſhould not be abrogated.</hi> In the third place, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, <hi>That they ſhould not allow Preachers in any place to explain the Goſpel, otherwiſe than by the interpretations of the Fathers.</hi> In fine, they ordained grievous penalties againſt the Printers and Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers who ſhould Print or Vend for the future the Books that contained that new Doctrine. The other Princes and States of the Empire, beholding this manifeſt oppreſſion, thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to make an Act of Proteſtation to the contrary. They remonſtrated therefore, <hi>That that new Decree contradicted that that had been paſſed in the preceding Aſſembly, where every one was to be free in reſpect of his Religion: That they did not pretend to hinder the other Princes and States from enjoying that liberty; but that on the contrary, they pray'd God, that he would give them the knowledge of his Truth: That they could not with a good conſcience approve of</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:97749:175"/>
                  <hi>the reaſon for which they would allow them to retain the Evangelical Doctrine, to wit, leſt they ſhould fall into new troubles, for that would be to confeſs, that it would be good to renounce that Doctrine, if it could be done without Tumult, which would be a criminal and wicked confeſſion, and a tacit denyal of the Word of God. That as to the Maſs, thoſe who had aboliſh'd it, and who had re-eſtabliſhed in its place the lawful uſe of the Supper of our Lord, were led by the inſtitution of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: That as for the Doctrine that oppoſed the real preſence, they did not believe, that they ought lightly to condemn thoſe who held it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing them; and that that proceeding was againſt natural equity, eſpecially in a matter of ſo great conſequence. In fine, that they could not conſent to that Decree, offering the reaſon of their carriage to the Emperour and all the world: That they did appeal to a free Council, and that in waiting for it, they would do nothing for which they ſhould juſtly deſerve any blame.</hi> The Princes who made this Act of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, were <hi>John</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony, George</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh, Erneſt</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> Dukes of <hi>Lunenburg, Philip</hi> Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of <hi>Heſſe, Wolfangus</hi> Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> to whom the Cities of <hi>Strasburg, Nuremburg, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm, Conſtance, Rutelin, Vinſſeme, Meminghen, Lindau, Campdun, Hailbrun, Iſſne, Wiſleburg, Nodingue</hi> and <hi>St. Gall</hi> joyned themſelves with a common conſent. This Act of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation was made at <hi>Spire</hi> the nineteenth of <hi>April</hi> 1529. and from thence came the name of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which has been ſince given to all thoſe who have embraced the Reformation.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Princes and thoſe Cities ſent in the end their Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to the Emperour, to give him an account of what they had done; but after divers delayes, the anſwer was, that he would that they ſhould obey the Decree of <hi>Spire,</hi> or elſe that they ſhould undergo the utmoſt puniſhments, that their Emperour and the other Princes had not leſs care of the ſalvation of their ſouls, and peace of their conſciences than they; and that as for his own part, he deſir'd a Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although it did not appear to him to be extreamly-neceſſary. This anſwer-oblig'd the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to meet at <hi>Smalcalde,</hi> and ſome time after at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> to provide for their own affairs; but they took no other reſolutions, than very general ones.</p>
               <p>About the end of that ſame year 1529. the Emperour came into <hi>Italy,</hi> to be crowned there by the hands of the Pope, which was done at <hi>Bologne,</hi> with a great deal of Magnificence and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. They had there divers Conferences together upon the matter of Religion. The ſentiment of the Emperour was, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97749:175"/>
he ought to call a Council; that of the Pope was on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that he ought not to call one; but that the adverſaries ought to be oppreſſed by force of Arms. He offered for that purpoſe, to furniſh the Emperour with money, and ſtrongly to ſolicite all Chriſtian Princes to this War. <hi>Andreo Mauroceno</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Hiſtorian relates, that he explain'd himſelf particularly not only to the Emperour, but even to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadour. The Senate anſwered after a manner very oppoſite to the deſires of that Pope; and diſſwaded him from that War, by divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: but all thoſe reaſons did not change the Popes mind, he had too much horror for that free Council that <hi>Germany</hi> required, and therefore it was, that he perſwaded the Emperour, that it would be much better for him to make uſe of his Authority in that occaſion, and that if his Authority would not be ſufficient, he muſt proceed to open force.</p>
               <p>The Emperour therefore after this conven'd the Imperial Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at <hi>Ausburg,</hi> for the month of <hi>April</hi> in the year 1530. whither he went himſelf in perſon. The Pope alſo ſent thither on his part his Legat Cardinal <hi>Campeius</hi> with <hi>Vincentius Pimpinella,</hi> and <hi>Paul Vergerius</hi> his <hi>Nuntio's.</hi> There, the Proteſtants preſented their Confeſſion of Faith to the Emperour, which was afterwards called <hi>The Confeſſion of Ausburg,</hi> in which they ſet down in the firſt place, the chief heads of the Chriſtian Doctrine which they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and afterwards went on to the points of the <hi>Roman</hi> belief which they rejected. They oppos'd, through the advice of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, to that <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> a <hi>Refutation</hi> compoſed by <hi>Eccius</hi> and <hi>John Faber,</hi> who notwithſtanding would not hold any diſcourſe by writing with the Proteſtants, whatſoever intreaties they ſhould make, to have liberty to defend themſelves publickly, and to juſtifie their Doctrine. They made it to be only read in their preſence; but they refuſed to give them a copy of it, unleſs upon condition that it ſhould be kept ſecret in their hands, which would render it wholly unuſeful to them, and which was a very unjuſt condition, in treating of a buſineſs of that nature, in which all the world had an intereſt. The Author of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> relates, that Cardinal <hi>Matthew Lang,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Saltsburg,</hi> who was in that Aſſembly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly upon the occaſion of that Confeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>That indeed, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Maſs was reaſonable, the liberty of meats fit to be granted, and that the demand to be diſcharged from ſo many command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, was moſt juſt; but that it was a thing not to be endured, that</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:97749:176"/>
                  <hi>one paultry Monk ſhould go about to reform all the world.</hi> He adds, that one of the Emperour's Secretaries ſaid alſo, <hi>That if the Proteſtant Preachers had good ſtore of money, they had eaſily purchaſed of the</hi> Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians <hi>the Religion that agreed moſt with them; but that without Gold, they could never hope, that their Religion ſhould ever ſhine forth in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were many open Conferences between the two Parties, and they came ſo far, as to agree upon ſome matters of leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but they could not agree upon any of the principal ones; and the Proteſtants ſaw ſoon after, to what thoſe Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences tended: to wit, to give ground to ſome ſecret practices, by which the Emperour and the Legate laboured to gain the Princes each one in particular, ſometimes by promiſes, and ſometimes by threatings, by which nevertheleſs they could not be turned. In fine, after many negotiations to no purpoſe, the Proteſtants ſeeing that there was no hope of obtaining peace, but upon conditions very deſtructive to the Reformation which they had embraced, were forced to withdraw themſelves, after having declared, <hi>That they perſiſted in their appeal to a free and Chriſtian Council.</hi> And the Emperour who had made all thoſe ſteps, only to have a pretence of gratifying the Pope, by his carrying of things to extremities, made in the end his Decree, with the other Princes and States that remained, by which he eſtabliſhed the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion in all the extent of his Empire, in reſpect of the controverted Articles, under pain of the Imperial Ban to all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, and to be purſued by Arms as Rebells and Criminals, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing notwithſtanding, to ſolicite the Pope to the calling of a Council preciſely within the ſpace of a year. The rigour of this Decree, oblig'd the Princes and the other Proteſtant States to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble yet again at <hi>Smalcalde,</hi> and to make there a kind of League among themſelves for their common defence; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they wrote to the Emperour with great ſubmiſſion, praying him to mitigate his Decree, and not to expoſe them as he had done, to the violence of their Enemies: They wrote alſo to the other Chriſtian Princes, as well to inform them of what had paſs'd at <hi>Ausburg,</hi> as to juſtifie themſelves againſt the many falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherewith they were charg'd, and to have them demand a General and free Council that ſhould be held in <hi>Germany</hi> for the Reformation of the Church. The Execution of this Decree of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> fill'd for ſome time <hi>Germany</hi> with a thouſand Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions againſt the Proteſtants, by the Authority of the Imperial Chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:97749:176"/>
Behold here, what the Emperour did to ſatisfie the deſires of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> it ſeems that he could have done nothing more vehemently; and yet notwithſtanding the Pope was not throughly contented. He very much rejoyced to ſee the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſubjected to the moſt rigorous puniſhments. But that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that <hi>Charles</hi> had taken upon him to appoint thoſe Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, to labour to bring thoſe differences to an agreement, the conſent that he had given to the abolition of ſome Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and above all, the promiſe of a Council within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed term of a year, were things that he could not digeſt; judging them to be too contrary to the Soveraignty of his See. And becauſe the Emperour had preſs'd him about this laſt Article of a Council, and even his Legate wrote to him, that it was the general deſire of all <hi>Germany,</hi> he returned this Anſwer: <hi>That having conſulted the Cardinals about it, divers of them had not found, that a Council was a very fit means for the rooting out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Hereſies, becauſe that thoſe things that had been decided by former Councils, or already eſtabliſhed by the practice of many Ages, ought not to be again called in queſtion. That this was a very bad precedent, and could not be done without very great ſcandal and a manifeſt violation of the Apoſtolick See. That nevertheleſs, if the Emperour judged a Council to be abſolutely neceſſary, he might promiſe the</hi> Lutherans <hi>one, but with this condition, that they ſhould preſently depart from all their Errors, and be obedient to their Holy Mother Church; that they ſhould hold her Doctrines and her Rites, until it ſhould be otherwiſe ordain'd by the Council, to the Decrees of which, they ſhould wholly ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. That beſides that, the calling of a Council would be very ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and of exceeding bad example to all poſterity. That as to the place where it ſhould be held, he judg'd it abſolutely neceſſary, that it ſhould be in</hi> Italy, <hi>and that he did not ſee any City more fit for it, than</hi> Rome <hi>it ſelf, which was the Seat of the Chriſtian Faith; that if, notwithſtanding</hi> Rome <hi>did not pleaſe him, he might chuſe one either in</hi> Bolognia, <hi>or</hi> Placentia, <hi>or</hi> Mantua. The Pope went even ſo far, as to write to the Chriſtian Princes a Circulary Letter, by which he adviſed them in the general, of that which had paſs'd at <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and that for the intire rooting out of Hereſie, he was reſolved to call a Council.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, all theſe Declarations conſiſted only in words; for at the bottom his mind was wholly remote from the holding of a Council; in which, as <hi>Guicciardine</hi> ſayes, he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, that they might conteſt his Papacy with him, which he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97749:177"/>
had purchaſed by canvaſings and money, and that they would take cognizance of the affairs of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> whom he had ſubdu'd and ſubjected to the Family of the <hi>Medici</hi> by force of Arms; or as the Author of the Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſayes, he feared leſt they ſhould beat down that exceſſive Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which the See of <hi>Rome</hi> had uſurped over all other Biſhops, and over all Churches. However it were, he would not have one; but he would that they ſhould make uſe of Fire and Sword. And it was for this, that he wrote about that ſame time to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperour's Brother, exhorting him to go him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in perſon to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to root out Hereſie there. He ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo the Emperour and the Chriſtian Kings to joyn their Arms with thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> againſt the <hi>Switz</hi> Cantons who had embraced the Reformation; and his Intrigues, or thoſe of his creatures, were ſo powerful, that they enflamed a bloody War between the Reformed Cantons and the others, wherein the Reformed were beaten many times, which afforded great matter of joy to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1532. the Emperour having called the Imperial Diet to <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> for the affairs of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Arms of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Princes and the other States aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, ſeeing clearly already, that the Pope and his Court ſought only to elude the Council, by divers pretences, ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Emperour, that he would be pleaſed to call one himſelf by his Authority; and they repreſented to him, that it was his right in the quality of <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour; that other Emperours had ſo uſed it, and that he was the Head and Protector of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, eſpecially in caſe of the negligence and refuſal of the Pope. The Emperour would not hearken to this Propoſition, and yet nevertheleſs, being urged by the neceſſity of his affairs, and having a War to maintain with the <hi>Turk,</hi> he granted a Peace to the Proteſtants, who were already ſeven Princes, and four and twenty Imperial Cities. This Peace was made at the Mediation of <hi>Albert</hi> Cardinal and Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> Prince Palatine of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> and the Emperour made his Decree pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, bearing in it expreſs prohibitions to trouble or diſquiet any perſon for matters of Religion only, till the holding of a General, Free and Chriſtian Council, which he endeavoured to have called within the term of a year; or in caſe that a Council could not be held, till a General Aſſembly of the States of the Empire, wherein they might provide for the affairs of Religion. This
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97749:177"/>
Decree diſpleas'd the Pope and all his Court extreamly, who would neither have a Peace, nor a Council, nor any Aſſembly of the States to treat of Religion, as it evidently appeared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. For after that the Emperour had ſet the affairs of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> in order, and had been freed from the force of <hi>Solyman,</hi> he went into <hi>Italy;</hi> and having urged the Pope many times upon that ſubject, the Pope alwayes eluded the Propoſition, as well by the conditions which he required that the Proteſtants ſhould ſubmit themſelves to, well knowing that they would not agree to them, as by the default of the conſent of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> without whom, he ſaid, it was to be feared, that the calling of a Council would create a new Schiſm in the Church. Thus the Papacy of <hi>Clement</hi> paſs'd away, who dyed the twenty fifth of <hi>September</hi> 1534.</p>
               <p>His Succeſſor who was <hi>Paul</hi> III. followed the ſame path of <hi>Clement</hi> in regard of the Proteſtants. The firſt ſtep that he made was to let his Nuntio <hi>Paulus Vergerius</hi> delcare, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to call a Council; but at the ſame time, he made theſe three things to be added, that he intended, it ſhould be held at <hi>Mantua</hi> and not in <hi>Germany,</hi> that he did not pretend to have any of his rights releaſed, and that he would not endure, that a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Council ſhould be held in <hi>Germany;</hi> upon which, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the anſwer of the Proteſtants. A little after the Proteſtants anſwered to this ſubſtance, <hi>That having already appealed to a Council, they ardently wiſhed for it; but that as they had often declared, they demanded a free Council, that ſhould provide againſt the diſorders of the Church, and make a good Reformation according to the Word of God, and in the terms of Chriſtian Equity, and it was a Council ſo qualified which they had appealed to. That the diſpute being about matters wherein the See of</hi> Rome <hi>was viſibly intereſted, and about others which the Pope defended, not in word only, but by thoſe bloody Edicts and extream Cruelties which they exerciſed againſt thoſe who did not agree with them, there was no colour of reaſon that the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be in their hands, nor that the Council could be free, if the choice of the place and the perſons who ſhould compoſe it, and the form of procedure which they held, ſhould depend upon their choice. That the Pope having already condemned them and their Doctrine, it was againſt all manner of reaſon, for him to pretend to be the Maſter of an Aſſembly who ſhould judge both them and the See of</hi> Rome. <hi>In fine, that the buſineſs being a common cauſe, it was the right of the Emperour and the Princes in ſo important an affair, to make choice of</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:97749:178"/>
                  <hi>the moſt fit perſons, and thoſe who were moſt capable of giving glory to God, and doing good to the Chriſtian Common-wealth: and that as for themſelves, as they could not abandon the intereſts of the Truth, they ſhould do alſo all that ſhould lye in their power for the re-eſtabliſhing of peace and union.</hi> We may gueſs that this anſwer was not very agreeable to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet notwithſtanding the Pope did not fail to ſpeak alwayes of a Council, and to exhort his Cardinals to begin the Reformation by themſelves. He made divers Orations to them for that purpoſe; and he went ſo far, as to give charge to ſome of them, to examine that which was moſt neceſſary to be reform'd in their Court, which had already alarm'd them all. But at the ſame time, he aſſur'd them by one of his actions by which they might very well judge of the little ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his words, for he created two young men, his Baſe Sons, Cardinals, the one of fourteen years of age, and the other of ſixteen: and when they repreſented to him their ſmall age, he anſwered merrily, That he would ſupply that defect, by the number of his own, having years enough to ſpare them, if it was neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The Pope's <hi>Nuntio</hi> having received the Anſwer of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, departed from <hi>Germany,</hi> and returned to <hi>Rome;</hi> where, after having made his relation, he concluded, that nothing more was to be thought on, than to oppreſs the Proteſtants by force of Arms. This <hi>Nuntio,</hi> who was <hi>Vergerius,</hi> had had divers private Conferences with them, and even with <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf, whom he had laboured to gain by threats and promiſes, but he could not obtain his deſign. This forced the Pope powerfully to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite the Emperour, who at that time came to <hi>Rome,</hi> openly to declare War againſt the Proteſtants, and he had in this, two great intereſts, the one to buſie the Emperour, whoſe power he feared in <hi>Italy;</hi> and the other, to confound the Proteſtants with his greateſt force, without the confuſion of holding a Council. The Emperour conſented to the deſires of the Pope, and he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved only to give a greater colour to the War, that a Council ſhould be firſt called, to let them ſee, that he had tryed fair means, before he came to violence: but that he ſhould call it under ſuch conditions, as that the Authority of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould incurr any danger. A Bull therefore was drawn up dated <hi>June</hi> 12. 1536. the Convocation of it was at <hi>Mantua</hi> on the three and twentieth of <hi>May</hi> of the year following; and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour having ſolicited the Proteſtants to go thither, they made
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97749:178"/>
well near the ſame anſwers that they had already done: They remonſtrated therefore in the firſt place, <hi>That the calling of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil could not of right belong to the Pope alone, as well by reaſon that the diſorders and corruptions of which they complain'd and deſir'd a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, came for the moſt part from the See of</hi> Rome <hi>and its creatures, which for ſome Ages ſince had infected Religion with divers errors and ſuperſtitions, and which moreover had been wholly overthrown in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church; as becauſe alſo, that that See was already the openly declared Enemy to the Reformation, and thoſe who demanded it, having condemn'd them for Hereticks, and perſecuted them in all places by Fire and Sword. So that being to give an account of all that to a Council, it was againſt all reaſon, to leave the calling of a Council to the Pope alone, which of right ought to belong to the Emperour and the Princes.</hi> Secondly, They noted, <hi>That the Pope by his Bull pretended to frame the Council out of his creatures, who were bound to him by an Oath, and to remain alſo himſelf the Judge and Maſter of all the difference, which was a manifeſt fallacy and injuſtice, the firmer to eſtabliſh his Authority under the pretence of a Council, and thoſe abuſes, the defence of which he had undertaken.</hi> In the third place, they took notice, That the Pope in his Bull had ſaid nothing of the manner of proceeding which they ought to uſe in the Council, from whence they concluded, that his intent was, to make thoſe things which they ſhould treat of there, to depend upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of his See, humane Traditions, and the Decrees of ſome later Councils, and not upon the Word of God alone. <hi>That by this means, that would be no more a free and Chriſtian Council, but a</hi> Roman <hi>Conventicle; which inſtead of tending to a holy Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could on the contrary tend to nothing but the confirmation of thoſe evils which had for ſo long a time infeſted the Church.</hi> As to the place where this pretended Council was called, they repreſented, <hi>That it was not juſt that it ſhould be in</hi> Italy, <hi>where they could have no ſecurity for themſelves, nor any liberty of opinion in a good conſcience, and that the Imperial Aſſemblies who had demanded it, had alwayes deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it ſhould be in</hi> Germany: <hi>That they therefore beſought the Emperour, that he would be pleaſed to conſider their reaſons, and to endeavour that the Council ſhould be lawful, to the end they might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily unite to the glory of God and the peace of</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting what had hapned at the Council of</hi> Conſtance <hi>to the Emperour</hi> Sigiſmund, <hi>who ſaw his Authority trampled under their feet, and his Letters of Safe-conduct violated, in the perſon of</hi> John Huſſe <hi>and</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom <hi>of</hi> Prague. They cauſed in the end a Writing to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97749:179"/>
containing all theſe reaſons, and divers others too long to tranſcribe, to juſtifie themſelves againſt the calumnies of their adverſaries; and they publiſhed it, not only in <hi>Germany,</hi> but in other foreign Countries alſo. Some time after, the Pope pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed another Bull, by which he prolonged the holding of the Council, under a pretence, that he could not agree with the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and a little after he aſſign'd it at <hi>Vicenza.</hi> Notwithſtanding the proſecutions continued alwayes againſt the Proteſtants every where, where the Pope had any Authority. In <hi>Germany</hi> the Imperial Chamber committed a thouſand injuſtices and outrages againſt them. In <hi>France,</hi> the flames were kindled in all the Provinces; and although <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth King of <hi>England</hi> had thrown off the Yoke of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet he did not fail (to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a good Catholick) to put to death without mercy all thoſe who had learned the New Religion. The ſame was done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and in all the Countreys of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1539. the Pope publiſhed a Bull, by which he ſuſpended the Convocation of a Council indefinitely, until it ſhould be his good pleaſure to have one held. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there was held in this ſame year an Imperial Diet at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> whither the Emperour ſent the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">li 247.</note> as his Commiſſioner, and decreed with him, that to labour to put an end to the differences about Religion, he ſhould make a friendly Conference between the moſt Learned and well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons both on the one ſide and on the other, who without the intervention of the Pope, ſhould have nothing before their eyes but the glory of God, and the good of the Church; and that notwithſtanding they ſhould let the Proteſtants have peace for fifteen months, under conditions that were yet harſh enough to them. But this Reſolution ſo highly offended the Pope, that as ſoon as he had received the news of it, he diſpatch'd away a <hi>Nuntio</hi> to the Emperour, who was then in <hi>Spain,</hi> with orders to complain, and to hinder by all ſorts of wayes, that he ſhould not authorize it by his conſent. The Proteſtants having ſent thither on their parts, the Emperour would not for that time declare himſelf; but diſmiſs'd that buſineſs to another ſeaſon. After which, he went into the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> to appeaſe ſome popular Sedition there; and having there put the matter into debate, becauſe he was to give ſome anſwer, Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> who was Legate there before him, oppoſed him with all his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97749:179"/>
might, remonſtrating the inconveniencies that might ariſe from ſuch a Conference, and that he had far better referr the cauſe of Religion to a Council, and notwithſtanding, to ſortifie the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick League, to make the Proteſtants ſubmit by fair means or foul; againſt whom he made a very long Invective. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel notwithſtanding did not then pleaſe the Emperour, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Diet to be held in <hi>Germany</hi> for the Conference; and he invited all the Princes to come in perſon thither, promiſing publick ſafety to all; which oblig'd the Cardinal Legate to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in great diſcontent. This Cardinal in his return, went into <hi>France,</hi> and obtain'd of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt an Edict againſt thoſe whom he call'd Hereticks and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> which was afterwards publiſh'd and executed through his whole Kingdom with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream rigour.</p>
               <p>The Conference was firſt aſſigned at <hi>Haguenaw,</hi> a little after at <hi>Wormes;</hi> and the Pope who feared the ſucceſs, thought good to ſend thither his <hi>Nuntio, Thomas Campeius</hi> with <hi>Paulus Vergerius,</hi> in whom he repoſed a great deal of confidence. But the Policy of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was too averſe to an accommodation, to ſuffer that Conference to proceed far: the Emperour therefore, at the urgent ſolicitation of the Pope, broke it off by expreſs Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and referred it to a Diet, which he would have held ſome time after at <hi>Ratisbon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Proteſtants ſaw clearly to what all theſe delayes tended, and yet nevertheleſs they did not fail to appear at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperour came in perſon, and whither the Pope had alſo ſent Cardinal <hi>Contarenus</hi> in the quality of his Legate. This was in the year 1541. Moreover, the Emperour cauſed a Book to be preſented on his part to the Aſſembly, which chiefly treated of the Articles of Religion, and particularly of thoſe which were in controverſie; and he declar'd, that it was his Will, that that Book ſhould be examined, and that it ſhould ſerve as the Theme or Subject of the Conference; for which he himſelf named the Collocutors, by the conſent of both parties, who deferr'd that nomination to him. In this Conference the Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors agreed upon ſome Articles, and could not agree upon ſome others; as upon thoſe of Tranſubſtantiation, of the Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Euchariſt, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the Celibacy of Prieſts, the Communion under one kind, the Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And the Emperour having conſulted the Legate about this, to know of him what he ſhould do on this occaſion, the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97749:180"/>
Legate gave him his anſwer in writing, <hi>That after having ſeen as well the Articles agreed upon between the Collocutors, as the others which they could not come to agree about, it was his judgement, that he ought to ordain nothing about the reſt, but that he ought to refer all to the Holy See, which could in a General Council, or otherwiſe do that which it ſhould judge neceſſary for the good of the Church, and in particular for that of</hi> Germany. The Emperour took this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, as if the Legate had conſented, that the Articles agreed upon between the Collocutors, ſhould immediately be received by both the Parties; and he related it to the Aſſembly after that manner. But there ſprung up a kind of diviſion between the Biſhops of one ſide, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Princes on the other. For the Princes would that the Articles agreed upon, ſhould be received, and that the reſt ſhould be referred either to a General or National Council, or at leaſt, to a General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the States of the Empire; and the Biſhops on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, who ſaw that this was the beginning of a Reformation, were of opinion, that they ſhould reject thoſe Articles agreed upon, wherein they ſaid that the Catholick Collocutors had too much given way to the Proteſtants, and that they ſhould change nothing either in Religion, or its Ceremonies, but that they ſhould refer all to a General or a National Council. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute therefore having ſo hapned, the Legate feared, leſt they ſhould upon this meddle with the affairs of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that he openly declared, by another publick Writing, that he did not mean, that they ſhould receive any Articles, but that they ſhould abſolutely refer all, as well the agreed on as the others, to his Holineſs, for him to determine what he ſhould think fit. He publiſhed yet farther another Writing, by which he very much condemned as well the Catholick Princes as the Biſhops, for that they had referr'd that buſineſs to a National Council, in defect of a General one: and he maintained that the Authority of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> was very much wounded in that reference, and that a National Council could not deliberate about matters of Religion. In fine, after a great many diſputes, which only ſerv'd more and more to diſcover the obſtinate reſolution that the <hi>Roman</hi> party had taken up not to ſuffer a Reformation: this Diet ended with a Decree of the Emperour, which referr'd the whole affair to a General Council, or a National one in <hi>Germany,</hi> or to an Imperial Aſſembly, if they could not obtain a Council, and that nevertheleſs the Execution of the Decree of <hi>Ausburg</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:97749:180"/>
ſhould remain ſuſpended. All this paſs'd in the year 1541.</p>
               <p>See here what the ſucceſs of the Conference of <hi>Ratisbon</hi> was. The year following, which was 1542. the Pope aſſign'd the Council to be held at <hi>Trent</hi> in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> he ſent a Bull to the Emperour in <hi>Spain,</hi> and after to the Kings, exhorting them to ſend their Embaſſadors thither, and he himſelf deputed thither three Cardinals in quality of Legates; he ſent thither ſome Biſhops alſo. But this Convocation had not then any effect, by reaſon of the War that was carried on about the ſame time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt and the Emperour. And this latter ſeeing himſelf to have two Wars upon his hands, that with <hi>France,</hi> and the other with the <hi>Turks,</hi> made a new Decree at <hi>Spire,</hi> by which he gave peace to the Proteſtants: but more than that, he ordain'd, that they ſhould make choice of ſome Learned and well-meaning perſons to draw up a Formulary of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; that the Princes ſhould do the ſame; and that all thoſe pieces being referred to the next Diet, they ſhould there reſolve with a common conſent, that which they ſhould judge fit to be kept about the matters of Religion, till the meeting of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. This Decree was made in the year 1544. But the Pope was ſo netled at this, that he wrote to the Emperour in a very threatning ſtyle, complaining above all things of this, that he had not referred that which concerned Religion, to the deciſion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he had favoured thoſe who were Rebels to the Apoſtolick See.</p>
               <p>Some time after King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt and the Emperour made a Peace; and one of the Articles of their Agreement was, that they ſhould defend the Ancient Religion, that they ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their endeavours for the Union of the Church, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they ſhould jointly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Pope the calling of a Council, and that they ſhould labour to ſubdue the Proteſtants. This obliged the Pope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them. He therefore again aſſigned the Council to be held at <hi>Trent</hi> the fifteenth day of <hi>March</hi> 1545. and diſpatched away his Legates thither; but at the ſame time he reſolv'd to uſe all his endeavours to oblige the Emperour to turn his Arms againſt the Proteſtants, to oppoſe them at the ſame time with the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal Sword; or to ſay better, to the end that the War might ſerve him for a pretence to elude the Council. For that purpoſe he made uſe of the Miniſtry of his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards of that Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> whom he ſent to the Emperour
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97749:181"/>
as his Legate, whoſe chief pretence was, the refuſals which the Proteſtants had propounded anew againſt his pretended Council. He made therefore very powerful ſolicitations to the Emperour by his Legate, with offers to aid him with men and money, and even to cauſe him to be aſſiſted by the Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> and the Emperour, who on his ſide was very glad to take this occaſion to ſubdue <hi>Germany</hi> to himſelf, readily accepted of this propoſition; ſo that a War was concluded between them; but the concluſion was kept very ſecret, till the time of Execution. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the better to cover this deſign, the Emperour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Conference of Learned Men to be held at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject of Religion, according to his laſt Decree, but he did not fail to cite the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> to appear before him, who had embraced the Reformation, and afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated him, and deprived him of his Arch-biſhoprick. And as for the Conference at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> which gave ſome jealouſie to the Biſhops who were already aſſembled at <hi>Trent,</hi> it was quickly after broken by the unjuſt conditions that ſome Monks, who were there as the Commiſſioners of the Emperour, would impoſe on the Proteſtant Divines. The Council was opened the thirteenth of <hi>December</hi> of the ſame year 1545.</p>
               <p>But, in fine, after a great many artifices and diſſimulations, able to have lull'd aſleep the moſt vigilant, after a great many contrary aſſurances given to the Proteſtants, the Emperour ſent the Cardinal of <hi>Trent</hi> in Poſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> to give the Pope notice, that he ſhould make his Troops march with all diligence. The Treaty which they had made together was publiſhed the eight and twentieth of <hi>July</hi> 1546. bearing this among other things, <hi>That the Emperour ſhould employ his Arms and open force to make thoſe</hi> Germans <hi>who ſhould reject the Council, return to the ancient Religion and to the obedience of the holy See:</hi> and the Emperour ſoon after, openly declared himſelf as well by the Letters which he wrote to divers Cities in <hi>Germany,</hi> to the Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Wirtemburg,</hi> as by the anſwers that his Miniſters gave to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of thoſe Towns who were with him. The Pope on his ſide, preſently publiſhed a Bull dated the fifteenth of <hi>July,</hi> by which he commanded, that they ſhould make ſolemn Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, exhorting all Chriſtians to put up prayers to God for the happy ſucceſs of the War, which the Emperour and himſelf had undertaken at their common charges, againſt the <hi>Germans</hi> who ſhould either profeſs Hereſie, or protect it. Before this, he had
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97749:181"/>
wrote to the <hi>Switzers</hi> Letters dated the third of <hi>June,</hi> by which he gave them notice of the Emperours deſign, praying them to ſend all the ſuccours they could poſſibly. The Emperour would at the beginning cover this War with another pretence than that of Religion; but the Pope would never ſuffer him to do it. So that the Emperour having no further way left to diſguiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, began with the proſcribing of the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> and the Lantgrave of <hi>Heſſia;</hi> and moreover, he ſent his Army into the field. The Proteſtant Princes, on their parts, took up Arms alſo for their juſt defence.</p>
               <p>The ſucceſs of this War was not ſo happy for the Proteſtants; all <hi>Germany</hi> ſaw it ſelf ſoon enſlav'd under the Arms of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; and according to all humane appearance, the Reformation alſo had been preſently deſtroy'd, if God who never utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes his Church, had not provided for it by his Providence. It hapned that the Pope and the Emperour quarrell'd about thoſe temporal intereſts, which were far more prevalent in their minds than that of Religion, which fell out becauſe the Emperour would not readily ſubject <hi>Germany</hi> to the Council of the Pope, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pope uſed alſo all his endeavours to ſtir up new affairs for the Emperour on the ſide of <hi>Italy.</hi> Moreover, a diviſion fell out in the Council; for the Pope having transferr'd it from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Bolognia,</hi> to have it more at his ordering, the greateſt part of the Biſhops yielded to that transferring; but many alſo held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves firm to <hi>Trent,</hi> and would not obey it; which made a great difficulty to ariſe, when the Emperour and the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> came to demand, as they afterwards did, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſhould be re-eſtabliſhed at <hi>Trent;</hi> becauſe thoſe of <hi>Bolognia</hi> ſtood upon it as a point of honour, not to go back to find thoſe of <hi>Trent</hi> there. King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt dyed in this time, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth King of <hi>England</hi> being dead alſo, the Reformation was quickly after received in <hi>England,</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, which a little diſturb'd the joyes of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> They were yet more diſturb'd by the Acts of Proteſtation which the Emperour had made againſt the Aſſembly at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> that he had treated it as an unlawful Aſſembly and a Conventicle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, that they ſhould return to <hi>Trent,</hi> with threats, that if the Pope continued to neglect his duty, he would himſelf out of his own Authority provide for the diſorders of the Church. They were troubled alſo at the <hi>Interim</hi> which the ſame Emperour pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed afterwards throughout all <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:97749:182"/>
This <hi>Interim</hi> was a certain Formulary of Religion that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had made to be drawn up to be obſerved until the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Lawful Council. He eſtabliſh'd therein the whole Body of the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine, and allowed only the Marriage of Prieſts and Communion under both kinds. But although this Formu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary was neither approved by the one ſort, nor the other, that at <hi>Rome</hi> the Pope had cenſured it, and the Proteſtants look'd upon it as the greateſt of all their oppreſſions, the Emperour did not fail to uſe violence to the Proteſtants to make them receive it. And this filled <hi>Germany</hi> with an infinite number of perſecutions, ſuch as thoſe that Conquerours when they cruelly abuſe their proſperity (as <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth did) are wont to make the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed ſuffer. But while he thus ſatiated himſelf with theſe violences and indignities, <hi>Paul</hi> the Third dyed at <hi>Rome</hi> the tenth of <hi>November</hi> 1549. The Death of this Pope was follow'd with divers Writings which wounded his Memory in the moſt bloody manner in the world. But letting paſs his Manners, and the reſt of his Government, wherein we are not concerned, I ſhall only ſay, that the evils which our Fathers ſuffered in all places for the Cauſe of the Reformation during the fifteen years of his Papacy, cannot be expreſs'd. For under the name of Hereticks or <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> they impriſoned them, they baniſhed them, they deprived them of their Eſtates, they maſſacred them, they burned them; and not to ſpeak of our <hi>France, England, Scotland, Flanders, Holland, Brabant, Haynalt, Artois, Spain, Savoy, Lorrain, Poland,</hi> were as ſo many Theatres, wherein there might be every day ſeen ſome of thoſe Tragical Executions, and where they ſpoke of nothing but the extirpation and rooting out of theſe Hereticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julius</hi> the third ſucceeded <hi>Paul.</hi> This man freely transferr'd his Council back to <hi>Trent,</hi> to make all oppoſition between the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and himſelf ceaſe; but in the Bull which he publiſh'd, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that it belong'd to him to rule and guide the Council: that he remitted it to be <hi>followed and continued,</hi> in the ſame ſtate in which it was when it was broken off; and that he would ſend his Legates thither to preſide in his place, in caſe he could not come thither himſelf in perſon. Theſe clauſes netled the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, ſo that ſeeing themſelves preſs'd by the Emperour, to ſubmit themſelves to the Council, they freely declared to him, that they could not do it, otherwiſe than upon theſe conditions, to wit, <hi>That they ſhould begin to treat of matters all anew, without having regard to that which had been already done. That their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97749:182"/>
ſhould be received, and have a deliberative voice: That the Pope ſhould not pretend to preſide, but that he ſhould ſubmit himſelf to it; and in fine, that he ſhould abſolve the Biſhops from the Oath by which they were ty'd to him; and that without that, they could not hold that to be a free Council.</hi> Notwithſtanding this Declaration, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour made his Decree, by which he ordain'd, that they ſhould ſubmit themſelves to the Council, promiſing on his part, that he would give Safe-Conduct to all the World to come thither, and to propoſe there all that they ſhould judge neceſſary for the good of the Church, and ſalvation of Souls; and that he would give order, that all things ſhould be treated and determined holily and Chriſtianly, according to the holy Scripture, and the Doctrine of the Fathers; and that the ſtate of the Church ſhould be reformed there, and falſe Doctrines and Errours taken away.</p>
               <p>Thus the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was continued, whither the Pope ſent his Legate and two <hi>Nuntio's,</hi> to preſide there in his Name, with orders to begin the firſt Seſſion the firſt day of <hi>May</hi> 1555. which was yet nevertheleſs prorogued to the firſt of <hi>September</hi> following. The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> both Proteſtants, with ſome Imperial Cities reſolved to ſend their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thither, and made them demand of the Emperours Embaſſadour a Letter of Safe-conduct in the ſame form that the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> had given it to the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> with an intermiſſion till their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſhould be arrived. This demand was not without ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, but the Queſtion having been agitated at <hi>Rome,</hi> they thought good to agree, that they ſhould have a Safe-conduct in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms, without delaying upon that account the deciſion of the chief matters: and before the expediting of this Safe-conduct, they had determined the principal Points touching the Euchariſt, to wit, Tranſubſtantiation, the Real Preſence, the Adoration of the Hoſt, the Concomitance, the Cuſtom of the <hi>Feſte Dieu</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">When they ſolemnly <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>, the reſervation of the Sacrament, and the neceſſity of Auricular Confeſſion before the Communion. They agreed only with the Embaſſadour of the Emperour, that they ſhould delay the deciſion of theſe four Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, <hi>Whether it was neceſſary to ſalvation, that all ſhould receive the Sacrament in both kinds. Whether he that received in one, took leſs than he that received in both. Whether the Church was in an Error, when ſhe ordained that the Prieſts only ſhould receive in both. Whether the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt ought alſo to be given to little children.</hi> Which was already a meer Fallacy, as if the Proteſtants had nothing to propoſe, but only about thoſe four Queſtions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:97749:183"/>
When the Proteſtant Deputies were arrived, they openly complained of the form of their Safe-conduct, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded one in the form of that of <hi>Baſil</hi> to the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> but they refuſed it. They demanded that they might be heard in full Council, but they would not; and they obtained with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, to be heard in a Congregation in the houſe of the Legate. In this Congregation they demanded on the behalf of their Maſters, 1. <hi>That the Article of the Superiority of the Council above the Pope, decided in the Councils of</hi> Conſtance <hi>and</hi> Baſil <hi>might be laid down for a foundation.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Pope, ſince he was a party in this affair, ſhould not preſide in the Council, but that he ſhould ſubmit to it both himſelf and his See, to be judged there.</hi> 3. <hi>That he ſhould for this effect abſolve the Biſhops of the Oaths that he had given them.</hi> 4. <hi>That the matters which had been already decided, ſhould be judged of again after their Divines had been heard, ſince they could not till then have come to the Council, not having had Safe-conduct.</hi> 5. <hi>That they ſhould deferr all judgement till they came.</hi> 6. <hi>That they ſhould judge according to the Word of God, and the common belief of all Chriſtian Nations.</hi> But the Prelates would not hear theſe Propoſitions, and the Legate, who conſulted the Pope upon all matters, and more eſpecially upon theſe, had already thus vehemently explained himſelf, <hi>That they had much rather loſe their lives, than releaſe any thing of the Authority of the Holy See.</hi> Some dayes after, the Divines of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Strasburg</hi> arrived at <hi>Trent,</hi> and preſented their Confeſſion, demanding that it ſhould be examined, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering themſelves to explain and defend it; but this was to no purpoſe: for the Pope had expreſly forbad his Legate to permit, that they ſhould enter upon any publick conference, neither <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> or by Writing in the matters of Religion. Thus things were carried on in this Council,</p>
               <p>But while affairs were manag'd after this manner, the Pope, who for ſome time before had been diſcontented at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, had made his Treaty with King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second; and the King on his ſide had alſo very ſecretly treated with <hi>Maurice</hi> the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> for the Liberty of <hi>Germany;</hi> ſo that matters were all on a ſudden ready for a War; and the news being come to <hi>Trent,</hi> the Pope preſently ſeparated the Aſſembly, giving order to his <hi>Nuntio</hi>'s to give notice of it every where, and to ſuſpend the Council till another time. This War freed <hi>Germany</hi> from its ſlavery under <hi>Charles;</hi> he was forced to ſet all the Princes at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty whom he kept Priſoners: and in fine, to make the Peace
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97749:183"/>
which was concluded at <hi>Paſſaw</hi> the laſt day of <hi>July</hi> 1552. By this Peace it was concluded, that the Emperour ſhould call within ſix Months the General Aſſembly of the Empire, there to provide means for the accommodating of the differences of Religion, and that notwithſtanding no perſon ſhould be diſquieted upon that occaſion: and thus the <hi>Interim</hi> of the Emperour was aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>Germany</hi> had then any Quiet, the Perſecutions were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed elſewhere againſt the Reformed. <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth being dead in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> having ſucceeded him, the Pope ſent Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> thither in quality of his Legate, who negotiated there the re-eſtabliſhing of the Authority and Religion of the Pope. This made the flames to be kindled, and their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be renewed after the moſt cruel manner in the world; for in one only year they made an infinite number of the people to be burn'd for the ſake of Religion, and one hundred ſeventy and ſix perſons of great quality. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and Siſter to <hi>Mary,</hi> was confin'd to a ſtrait Priſon. On the other ſide, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi> and Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> made a rigorous Edict upon the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, for all the Lands of his obedience, and drove away from <hi>Bahemia</hi> alone, more than two hundred Miniſters. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour on his part, alwayes cauſed the Laws of the Inquiſition to be moſt rigorouſly obſerved in the <hi>Low-Countreys.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did the ſame thing in his Countreys. <hi>France</hi> every day beheld nothing but theſe ſad Executions; and yet nevertheleſs, all theſe bloody purſuits did but increaſe in all places, the number of thoſe who embraced the Reformation. Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Third dyed the three and twentieth of <hi>March</hi> 1555. and <hi>Marcellus</hi> the Second was choſen in his place; who not having held the See more than-two and twenty dayes, had for his Succeſſour <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth.</p>
               <p>In this ſame year, there was an Imperial Aſſembly held at <hi>Ausburg,</hi> where the Treaty of Peace made at <hi>Paſſaw</hi> was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the freedom of <hi>Religion</hi> granted by the Emperour and the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Decree was preſently pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. But notwithſtanding, the people of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Bavaria</hi> having demanded with very great urgency a Reformation of their Princes, it was refuſed them; and they agreed only, that they ſhould receive the Communion under both kinds, in waiting for a Council. This did not fail to give great diſpleaſure to the Pope, beholding on one ſide, that all parts of the World were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97749:184"/>
ſwallow'd up by the Superſtitions and Errors of his Church; and on the other, that even the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Princes, of whom he expected an entire obedience, undertook without his conſent to change ſomething in Religion. In this ſame time <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, weary of affairs, and having but a weak conſtitution, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to quit the World; and for this effect, having made <hi>Philip</hi> his Son to come to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> he demis'd to him the Soveraignty of the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> in his favour; and a Month after he yielded to him the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> He reſigned the Empire to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Brother, and reſerving to himſelf the Penſion of an hundred thouſand Crowns, he retired into a Monaſtery. This hapned in the year 1556. and he dyed two years after the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>September</hi> 1558.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth from the firſt beginning of his Papacy turn'd all his thoughts to avoid the Council, and to make the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gors of the Inquiſition to rule in all places, ſaying, <hi>That this was the only means to deſtroy Hereſie, and the only fort of the Apoſtolick See.</hi> For this effect he made an Ordinance which he cauſed all the Cardinals to ſign, by which he renewed all the cenſures and puniſhments denounced by his Predeceſſors againſt the Hereticks, and declared, that all the Prelates, Princes, Kings and Emperours fallen into Herefie, ought to be held fallen from and deprived of all their Benefices, Eſtates, Kingdoms or Empires, without any other declaration, that they could not be re-eſtabliſhed by any authority, not even by that of the Apoſtolick See, and that their goods ſhould be given to the firſt poſſeſſor. He quarrell'd at the ſame time with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> maintaining that the Reſignation of <hi>Charles</hi> in his favour, could not be done but by his hands; and that in that caſe it belonged to him to make whom he ſhould pleaſe, Emperour. Notwithſtanding, two things fell out, that gave him a great deal of grief; the one, that <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> being dead, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſucceeded her; and that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> having propounded to the Proteſtants in the Diet of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> which was held in the Month of <hi>February</hi> 1559. to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97749:184"/>
Party, and ſubmit himſelf to the judgement of the Council. That for that effect, it was neceſſary that the Pope ſhould releaſe them of the Oath by which he held all the Prelates bound to his See, to the end that the Prelates and Divines there might give their opinion freely, and that all ſhould be judg'd there by the Word of God alone, and not by the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſtitutions and their pretended Traditions. That it was juſt, that their Divines ſhould be heard, and that they might declare their opinion in the deciſion of thoſe differences, and by conſequence, all the Acts and all the Decrees made at <hi>Trent,</hi> remaining as not made, that they ſhould treat the things anew. That with theſe conditions they conſented with all their hearts, and ſubmitted themſelves to a Council; but not otherwiſe. So that the Emperour ſeeing well that the Pope and his Court would never agree to thoſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor conſent to any Council, at leaſt, unleſs they ſhould be Maſters of it, further confirmed the Treaty of <hi>Paſſaw,</hi> and ſetled the peace of <hi>Germany</hi> about the matter of Religion, leaving to every one the liberty of his conſcience. This mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Pope; but elſewhere, he comforted himſelf with hearing that his ſolicitations with the other Princes to continue the rooting out of the Hereticks by Fire and Sword, and every where all the rigours of puniſhments had a very great effect in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> and in the <hi>Low-Countreys. Henry</hi> the Second dyed the third of <hi>June</hi> of the ſame year 1559. The Pope dyed alſo quickly after, to wit, the eighteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> of the ſame year. His laſt words were to recommend to the Cardinals <hi>the holy Office of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;</hi> for ſo he called it: aſſuring them, that it was the only Pillar of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> His Memory was very much deteſted by all the people, who immediately after his death burn'd the new Priſon of the Inquiſition which he had cauſed to be built, broke his Statues, and overthrew his Coat of Arms throughout all the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth ſucceeded him; and it was under him that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was conſummated. He followed intirely the Spirit of his Predeceſſor; for he preſently moved the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to turn his Arms againſt his Subjects of the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to reduce them by force to the obedience of his See; and becauſe that in <hi>France,</hi> they had reſolved to call a National Council, to labour by this means to put a ſtop to the courſe of the Reformation, againſt which the fires and puniſhments pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed till that time had done nothing, he oppos'd himſelf vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97749:185"/>
to it, and ſent to King <hi>Francis</hi> the Second an expreſs <hi>Nuntio,</hi> to diſſwade him from that National Council, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him to follow the way of the puniſhments that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore practis'd: and that of his Arms, if it were neceſſary, till it ſhould be provided for by a General Council, offering him for that purpoſe to aſſiſt him with all his power, and to cauſe the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to aſſiſt him alſo. The <hi>Nuntio</hi> faithfully acquitted himſelf of his charge; but the King did yet perſiſt in the deſign of a National Council, and it was reſolved in his Council, that they ſhould ſeek for the means to call it, in caſe the Pope ſhould not ſpeedily call a General one. This was the reſolution of an Aſſembly held at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1560. which no wayes pleaſed the Pope; for he ſaw well, that this National Council was a very bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for <hi>Germany,</hi> where till then his Predeceſſors had hindred it. So that ſeeing no very good means to ward off that blow, and apprehending that other Nations would do the ſame things, he ſuddenly took up a reſolution to aſſemble his Council at <hi>Trent.</hi> But beſides that reaſon of National Councils which he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, he was further carried out to it by divers other motives; for he ſaw that the Reformed Religion had ſpread it ſelf abroad every where. In <hi>Spain</hi> the Inquiſitions were taken up only with condemning and burning them; and they had alwayes ſome new matter for the exerciſe of their cruelties. It was the ſame in the <hi>Low-Countreys. England</hi> had wholly thrown off the yoke of <hi>Rome,</hi> and embraced the Reformation: <hi>Scotland</hi> had done it as much. All <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Livonia</hi> had done the ſame. In <hi>France</hi> the number of the Proteſtants was very much increaſed, and they had the liberty of their conſciences granted them. The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> could not compaſs his deſign with all his Forces, in the ſole Valleys of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> Beſides, that which remain'd fix'd to the intereſts of the Pope, was very much diſcontented with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Court, the greateſt part of his Catholicks had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the neceſſity of a Reformation, and they made Harangues about it in the publick aſſemblies. The Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who the moſt ſupported the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> every day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon his Authority, and gave him trouble enough. He reſolv'd with himſelf therefore to aſſemble his Council; but at the ſame time, alſo he made it his deſign to manage it ſo well, that the ſucceſs ſhould be advantageous for himſelf. To this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, he publiſhed his Bull, bearing this with it, that he took off
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97749:185"/>
the ſuſpenſion that had been made, and called it to <hi>Trent:</hi> on <hi>Eaſter</hi> day in the year 1563. He ſent thither five Legates to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in his place; and after divers delayes, in fine, the Council was opened by his Order the eighteenth of <hi>January</hi> 1562. and matters were treated there afterwards after the ſame manner which they had been treated in before under <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, and under <hi>Julius;</hi> that is to ſay, that the Pope reigned there abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and nothing was done there but according to his will. His See was exalted there more than before, the diſorders of the Government of the Church were rather confirmed than corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted there, and the Errors, and Superſtitions, and Worſhip ſet up by men, inſtead of being reformed, were on the contrary eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed there, and paſſed in the force of a perpetual and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Law. Such was the ſucceſs of this Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>It would be too long here to relate exactly that which paſſed there. Any may read with pleaſure and with profit all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities in ſome of the famous Hiſtorians of thoſe times. It ſhall ſuffice me for the preſent to ſay, that after the manner that the Popes took there for the governing that Council, we ought not to think it ſtrange if they obtain'd their ends, and if they alwayes turn'd things to which ſide they pleaſed. Firſt of all, they took a particular care to fill it with <hi>Italian</hi> Prelates; ſo that they alone almoſt alwayes were above half the number of all the other Nations joyned together. By this means the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> might very well aſſure it ſelf of the Council; for although all the Prelates that compoſed it, ſhould not have been bound to the Popes by an Oath, yet the <hi>Italians</hi> were more particularly of their dependance, and they would not fail throughly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to them the intereſt that <hi>Italy</hi> had to preſerve to it ſelf the Eccleſiaſtical Government over other Nations; and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by conſequence, the Authority of <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly, They kept up a ſtock of money in the hands of the Legates, to help the poor Biſhops, and to gain them more and more to them, and to make alſo Preſents and Gratifications to perſons who could render them moſt ſervice. For they judged it to be the beſt means to draw the moſt to them, either by the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the good offices received from them, or by the hopes of receiving them for the time to come. In the Third place, the Pope was not contented with preſiding in the Council by his Legates, he would farther, that the propoſitions ſhould be made and carried by them only. And it was for this that the Legates
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97749:186"/>
of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth unjuſtly inſinuated it into the Decree of the opening it on the eighteenth of <hi>January</hi> 1562. that they ſhould treat of matters <hi>proponentibus Legatis;</hi> and when ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelates would have oppoſed that Clauſe, ſaying, that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual in Councils, and that it wholly took away all liberty from the Aſſembly, where every one ought to have a right to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, they derided them and let them alone without giving them any anſwer. The Pope himſelf having heard of that oppoſition, commanded his Legates, that they ſhould remain obſtinate in that Decree, and that they ſhould not remit ſo much as one point: and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having made ſome complaints, upon the advice that his Embaſſadour gave him, the Pope eluded them, and would change nothing.</p>
               <p>Behold therefore the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> well nigh already aſſured of two great points; to wit, on the one ſide, of the greateſt number of perſons; and on the other, of the propoſitions that ſhould be made in the Council. There remained nothing but to make ſure of their deliberations; and for this they practiſed divers means. The two more General, were that of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations at <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf in the houſe of the chief Legate, and that of the Congregations at <hi>Rome.</hi> The former conſiſted in this, that from the beginning of the Council under <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, they unjuſtly made this order to be eſtabliſh'd, that in imitation of that which had been made in the laſt Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> that there ſhould be made divers particular Congregations to examine the matters there that the Legates ſhould propound to them, that afterwards the ſame matters ſo digeſted, be brought to a General Congregation which ſhould be held in the houſe of the Legate, where every one ſhould tell his opinion; and that after this, they ſhould frame the Decrees to contain them, and make them to paſs in Council. The ſecond conſiſted in this, in that from the firſt beginning, the Pope had deputed ſome Cardinals at <hi>Rome</hi> to conſult about the affairs of the Council, and to have as it were the overlooking of all that ſhould paſs there; ſo that, before they came to make any Decree, the Legates at <hi>Trent</hi> had diſcover'd the bottom of the ſentiments of the Prelates, and the reaſons of every one, ſince before they concluded any thing, they ſent all to <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence they received their orders and the deliberations of the Council wholly made to their hands; and this is that which they call'd <hi>the Holy Ghoſt coming in a Cloak-bag.</hi> But beſides theſe two wayes, they had yet others, which although
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97749:186"/>
they were not of that importance, did not fail to have their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. We muſt place in this rank, the Order that they took to examine all the ſpeeches and all the other actions that ſhould be done before the Prelates, of the Council, before they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them, to the end that nothing ſhould be advanced, which was not agreeable to the Time and Place, that is to ſay, to the deſigns and intereſts of <hi>Rome;</hi> for by this means the Council thought to make the Pulpits ring with nothing but the praiſes of the Holy See, and imprecations againſt the Hereticks; and that none ſhould be ſo ſtupid, as to bring in any thing free or bold into his diſcourſe, well knowing that the Cenſors would not ſuffer it, and that it would be to meddle with affairs to no purpoſe. We muſt here alſo place the Order that the Legates openly took, and which they alwayes obſerv'd afterwards, to reckon every head to an opinion; whereas in the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> they had counted their opinions by Nations, which divers would fain have had done yet at <hi>Trent;</hi> but the Legates oppos'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it with all their might. But they drew this advantage from that Order, that <hi>Italy</hi> alone had twice as many Voices, as all the other Nations together; and we may ſay, that they only made the deciſions. We muſt further rank here another Order which they took to make in the firſt place the points of Doctrine to be agitated by particular Congregations of Monks and other Scholaſtick Divines, which treated of them after their uſual manner; and afterwards to carry ſome extracts or abridgements of their Diſputes to the Congregations of the Prelates, who for the moſt part underſtood nothing of that Gibbriſh of the School; ſo that almoſt alwayes they made their Decrees without having examined the matters of them, or hearing the reaſons of one ſide and of the other, without reading, without meditation, without ſtudy, and ſometimes even without any underſtanding of the terms; which having oblig'd <hi>Bruce Martel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Feſola</hi> to repreſent of what importance it was, that the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſhould be throughly informed of what they did, and that it ſhould take cognizance of matters it ſelf; the Legates netled at this boldneſs, made a large field of a ſharp cenſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and wrote to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to have him taken notice of. We ought alſo to place here, the recourſe that the Pope had to the Embaſſadours of the Princes, to render the Biſhops of their Nation favourable to the intereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> This is what <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth knew very well how to practiſe on
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97749:187"/>
the ſubject of the reſidence of the Biſhops, when he heard that the greateſt part of Voices went about to declare it of Divine Right; for he ſpake earneſtly of it to the Embaſſadours of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> and <hi>Florence;</hi> and he engaged them to make divers remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of it to their Biſhops. The ſame things were done di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times. We muſt add here yet farther, the ordinary dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Legates to put off to another time the deciſion of the points that they could not carry on their ſide at one time, and to paſs over to other matters, to buſie the Prelates with, and to have time notwithſtanding, to advertiſe the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to gain the chief to the contrary party. We ought to place here alſo the ordinary artifice of the ſame Legates to put off the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to make many difficulties ariſe about matters, and after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers circuits, to cauſe in the end the Articles to be ſent to the Pope which they could not make an end of, by reaſon of the great inſiſting of the Nations. In one word, they uſed in the management of this Aſſembly all that was moſt refin'd, moſt forcible and profound in humane policy, promiſes, threats, ſecret negotiations, canvaſings, diverſions, delayes, Authority, and in General, nothing was forborn that could turn and corrupt mens minds there. The Pope and his Court had a great many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to overcome, and oppoſitions to ſurmount, which often put them into great troubles, and inquietudes, and fears; but in the end, they were ſo well ſerved, and they remained Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſaw all things ſucceed according to their deſires.</p>
               <p>See here after what manner things went at <hi>Trent,</hi> and by what degrees they tended to make an entire breach of Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Roman</hi> and Reformed party. Let any now judge, if in all this conduct, our Fathers had not juſt and lawful cauſes for a Separation. 1. They ſaw in the contrary party an invincible reſolution to defend and preſerve the Errors and Superſtitions, whoſe amendment they demanded. 2. They ſaw that reſolution go ſo high, as to conſtrain them to fall back again into thoſe errors againſt all their knowledge, and the motions of their own conſciences. 3. They ſaw that this violence which they offered to them had no bounds; for it went not only as far as diſputes, not only ſo far as the Ordinances and Decrees, but even to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications and Anathema's, that is to ſay, to a Separation, and Schiſm with a curſe. 4. They ſaw, that they joyned to all this puniſhments, not in one or two places, but in all; not by popular heat, but in cold blood, and in the uſual wayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97749:187"/>
for the puniſhment of the greateſt Villains. 5. They ſaw that thoſe puniſhments came from the perpetual and general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which did not ceaſe perſecuting of them in all places; and which proceeded ſo far, as to ſearch for them in their moſt hidden retreats. 6. They ſaw that they refuſed the moſt equitable and neceſſary conditions, without which they could not proceed to a juſt examination of Religion, nor to a holy and Chriſtian Reformation, and that in ſtead of that, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would alwayes remain ſole Miſtreſs and Arbitreſs. 7. They ſaw, laſtly, that inſtead of returning to the purity of Chriſtianity, by taking away out of the field of the Church ſo many corruptions that defaced it, ſo many falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that deſtroy'd it, ſo many kinds of Worſhip contrary to true Piety that diſhonour'd it, and deſtroyed the ſalvation of ſouls, theſe Prelates on the contrary, would eſtabliſh things that cuſtom only, and the tradition of ſome Ages had for the moſt part introduc'd; that they would eſtabliſh them I ſay, for the future in force of a Law, to be incorporated into their Religion, as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and indiſpenſable parts of it, to which they would ſubject the minds and conſciences of men, which they ordain'd the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and belief of, under penalties of <hi>Anathema,</hi> cutting off and ſeparating from the body of their Society all thoſe who ſhould hold a contrary opinion and practice. Let any judge, whether our Fathers could yet after that, preſerve Church Communion with a Party in which they could ſee nothing either of the Spirit of Truth, and Chriſtian Purity and Charity, reſplendent, and whether all hope being taken away, of ever reducing them to the right way of the Goſpel, or even of being able to live with them, without wounding their conſciences by a deteſtable hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, in pretending to believe that which they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and to practiſing a worſhip which they held unlawful, there not remaining any further means for them to remain in that Communion, without partaking of their Errors, without expoſing their Children, and without rendring themſelves cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable before God; let any I ſay judge, whether they did not do well to ſeparate themſelves. I confeſs, that when a man is joyned with others in one and the ſame Body, he ought not lightly to proceed to a rupture; there are meaſures and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to be obſerv'd, that Prudence and Chriſtian Charity require of us, and as long as we have any hope of procuring the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and healing of our Brethren, or where there is at leaſt any
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97749:188"/>
way for us to bewail, and to mourn for their ſins, without loſing our own innocency, and their conſtraining us to partake in their crimes, we ought not to forſake them. But when that hope is loſt, and when that means of preſerving our own purity is taken from us, when inſtead of being able to reduce them, we ſee, on the contrary, that their Communion does but make us to caſt our ſelves into an unavoidable neceſſity of corrupting our ſelves, it is certain that we ought to withdraw our ſelves from them, leſt in partaking with their ſins, we ſhould draw the juſt condemnation of God upon our ſelves. <hi>Be not partaker with other mens ſins,</hi> ſayes S. <hi>Paul, but keep thy ſelf pure.</hi>

                     <hi>An Examination of the Objection of the Author of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, taken out of the Diſpute of S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>againſt the Schiſm of the</hi> Donatiſts.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT ſeems to me, that what I have laid down hitherto, lets us clearly enough ſee, that the only way to decide the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of our Separation, to know whether it is juſt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; is to enter into the diſcuſſion of the foundation of our Controverſies, and that it would be the higheſt injuſtice to go about to condemn us without ever hearing us. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whatſoever we may have to ſay, and how ſtrong ſoever our Reaſons ſhould be, the Author of the Prejudices pretends to have found out a certain way to convince us of Schiſm, without entring upon any other examination; and for this he employes the Eighth and Ninth Chapters of his Treatiſe. <hi>I would,</hi> ſayes he, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prejug. ch.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 161.</note> 
                  <hi>go farther, and convince them of Schiſm, without entring upon any diſcuſſion of either their Doctrine or their Miſſion, by their ſeparation alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that he ſayes upon that ſubject, may be well near reduc'd to this; <q>
                     <hi>That there is a Church, from which one ought never to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, under any pretence whatſoever, and from which all thoſe who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves are Schiſmaticks, and out of the ſtate of ſalvation. That the infallible and perpetual mark to know this Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>and the other</hi> African <hi>Fathers is, viſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion throughout all Nations, becauſe that viſible extenſion according to them contains the Church at all times, and that it is a Negative mark, that is to ſay, that every Society which has not that extenſion, is not the Church; ſo that this reaſoning is alwayes ſound, your Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety is ſhut up in a little part of the world. Therefore it is not the Church; and that it is by this Principle, that S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed againſt the</hi> Donatiſts, <hi>and convinced them of Schiſm.</hi>
                  </q> This is the ſumm of his eighth Chapter. In the ninth, he labours to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply theſe general Maxims to our Separation: and 1. He ſayes,<q> 
                     <hi>That our Communion is not ſpread over all the world, any more than that of the</hi> Donatiſts; <hi>and that not having that viſible extenſion, which is the perpetual mark of the True Church, it follows, that it is not ſo, and by conſequence, that we are all Schiſmaticks.</hi>
                  </q>2. He

                     <hi>We carry the principle of the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>much higher than thoſe Schiſmaticks ſtretch'd it; for as for them, they did not ſay, that there ever was a time in which the Church had wholly fell into Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſic, and that they excepted the Communion of</hi> Donatus; <hi>but as for us, we will have it, that there has been whole Ages in which all the world had generally apoſtatized, and loſt the faith and treaſure of ſalvation.</hi> 3. <hi>He labours to ſhew, that the Societies of the</hi> Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, <hi>of the</hi> Waldenſes <hi>and</hi> Albigenſes, &amp;c. <hi>in whom he ſayes, we ſhut up the Church, could not be this Catholick Church of which S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>ſpeaks.

               <p>Before we enter upon the particular Examination of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions whereof this Objection is made up, it will be good to note, that there is nothing new in all that, and that it is nothing but that ſome mark of viſible extenſion that the greateſt part of the Controverſial Writers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion have been wont to propound, when they would give the marks of the True Church. There is this only difference to be found in it, that the others labour to ground this upon what they produce out of the paſſages of the Scripture, whereas the Author of the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices grounds his argument upon the ſole Authority of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and ſome Fathers. But when it ſhould be true, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Fathers diſputing againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> ſhould have preſt this viſible extenſion of the Church too much, and urged it further than they ought, will the Author of the Prejudices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he ought to hold all thoſe things that the Fathers have advanc'd in their diſputes for infallible, and all their reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and hypotheſes to have been ſo?

is vagous, and when they anſwer to an adverſary, they propound ſometimes one thing, and ſometimes another; they argue as they think fit; they ſay one thing and do another: or as the Proverb ſayes, they offer bread, and give one a ſtone.

For however we ſhould read them, yet we cannot draw convincing teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from them, and it is allow'd us to depart from them, when we ſee that they themſelves have departed from the truth.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certain, that the Author of the Prejudices has but weakned his proof, when inſtead of labouring to eſtabliſh it on the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as the reſt have done, he reſtrains it to the meer Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and ſome Fathers.</p>
               <p>We have thought that we ought to have freely repreſented this to the Author of the Prejudices, to oblige him a little to moderate his pretenſions; for he imagin'd that the ſole Authority of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and ſome Fathers was enough to <hi>convince</hi> us. <hi>I will,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>convince them,</hi> we have frequently told him already, and ſhall tell him here again, That the Scripture is the only rule of our Faith, that, we do not acknowledge any other authority able to decide the diſputed Points in Religion, than that of the Word of God; and that if we ſometimes diſpute by the Fathers, it is but by way of condeſcention to thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to act upon their own principle, and not to ſubmit our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

to the word of men. But becauſe that he may alſo ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, under a pretence of this declaration, that we have no other way to anſwer his argument, I ſhall undertake to anſwer here, and ſhew him, if I can, that he has abuſed the Authority of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and that he has neither compriſed, or had a mind to comprehend, either the true ſentiments of that Father, or ours. This is that which I deſign to ſhew him in this Chapter and in the following. But before we enter upon this matter, it will be neceſſary to clear in a few words the Hiſtory of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts,</hi> and to repreſent what was the beginning of their quarrel, and what their Separation was. The Author of the Prejudices had ſome intereſt to leave his Readers in the ignorance of thoſe particular matters of fact; but ſince he and I have not the ſame view of things, he ought not to take it ill, that I ſupply his defect, and that I lay down that which he would not.</p>
               <p>In the year 306. God having given peace to the Church, after the cruel perſecutions of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> the people of <hi>Carthage</hi> being aſſembled by the direction of ſome neighbouring Biſhops, choſe <hi>Cecilianus</hi> for their Biſhop in the place of <hi>Menſurius</hi> who had been dead ſome time before, and <hi>Cecilianus</hi> afterwards received his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination at the hands of <hi>Felix</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aprungis.</hi> This Election had diſpleaſed ſome of that Church through their private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; ſo that they formed a party againſt him; and this party having called <hi>Secundus</hi> Primate of <hi>Numidia</hi> with a great many other Biſhops to the number of Seventy, they made his Ordination void, and ordained one <hi>Majorinus</hi> in his place. <hi>Cecilianus</hi> was upheld by a great part of the Church, and kept himſelf in his Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick. <hi>Majorinus</hi> was upheld alſo by thoſe of his party, and the Biſhops of <hi>Numidia;</hi> which made them ſet up at <hi>Carthage Altar againſt Altar;</hi> that is to ſay, that each Biſhop ſet up his Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies apart; and ſo the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> was rent. But this Diviſion did not ſtop at <hi>Carthage;</hi> for the Biſhops of <hi>Africa</hi> took part, ſome with <hi>Cecilianus,</hi> and the others with <hi>Majorinus;</hi> one of theſe was called <hi>Donatus,</hi> from whoſe name all that Sect came in the end to be called <hi>Donatiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Each party laboured to fortifie themſelves by reaſons; the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> on their ſide, at firſt accus'd <hi>Felix</hi> the Ordainer of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilianus,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Cecilianus</hi> himſelf, of having been <hi>Traditors,</hi> that is to ſay, of having delivered their Bibles to the Pagans for them to burn them, during the perſecutions. The others, on the contrary, maintained, that it was a falſe accuſation, of which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97749:190"/>
they had neither conviction nor proof, becauſe that <hi>Cecilianus</hi> had not been heard before his condemnation; and they alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed ſome of thoſe who had condemn'd him, of having been themſelves <hi>Traditors,</hi> and to have mutually abſolv'd one another of that crime in a Synod which they had held. The quarrel growing high, the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> preſented a Petition to the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> to intreat of him ſome Judges; becauſe that in <hi>Africa</hi> they were all divided and parties; and the Emperour commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned for that purpoſe, <hi>Milciades</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Merodes</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Milan, Maternus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cologne, Reticus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Autun,</hi> and <hi>Marinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles.</hi> Theſe Judges met together with ſome other Biſhops of <hi>Italy,</hi> all in number to nineteen, and having taken an exact knowledge of that buſineſs, they ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified <hi>Cecilianus,</hi> and confirmed him in his Biſhoprick: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, without making void either the Ordination of <hi>Majorinus,</hi> or that of his Succeſſors: but the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> would not acquieſce in this judgement. They ſaid, that <hi>Milciades</hi> had himſelf been a <hi>Traditor,</hi> and that he defended the <hi>Traditors.</hi> They had recourſe again to the Emperour, who ordain'd, that the cauſe ſhould be ſearch'd again, and determined in a Council at <hi>Arles,</hi> where the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> having been again condemn'd, they appealed to the Emperours own perſon; and the Emperour having taken cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of it himſelf, condemned them.</p>
               <p>After all this, the Opinionativeneſs of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> was ſo great, that inſtead of ſubmitting themſelves to ſo many judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they choſe rather to ſeparate themſelves from the whole Church. They made therefore a General Schiſm with the whole Chriſtian World; and to colour it with ſome appearance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they maintained, that all the world had fallen into Apoſtaſy through the meer Communion which it had with the <hi>Traditor Cecilianus.</hi> They would no more own either any Church or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in the world, but what was in their party; and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized all thoſe, who had been baptized in the Church ſince the buſineſs of <hi>Cecilianus.</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and the other Fathers of <hi>Africa,</hi> had fairly told them, that <hi>Cecilianus</hi> was innocent, that though he ſhould not have been innocent, the Judges could have done no leſs, than to have abſolved him, there having been no proofs againſt him, and that though even the Judges ſhould have judg'd wrong, yet all the world could not have been guilty of that crime, ſince the greater part of the Churches, and of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that compos'd them, had had no knowledge of that affair,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97749:191"/>
that though they ſhould have had knowledge of it, they could have done no otherwiſe than referr'd it to Judges; or laſtly, not being willing to refer it to Judges, prudence and charity would have oblig'd them to have bore with the wicked in the external communion of the Church, rather than to have broken Peace and Chriſtian Unity for perſonal crimes, which were not communicated to them who had no part in them. All theſe reaſons did not hinder the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> from remaining obſtinate in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which was that, all the Church had <hi>loſt its righteouſneſs</hi> by the Communion which it had with <hi>Cecilianus;</hi> and that there was no more any Chriſtianity in the World, except in the party of <hi>Donatus.</hi> From hence it was, that the Queſtion aroſe between them, which of the two Parties was the Church.</p>
               <p>Upon this Hiſtory, we muſt make four Obſervations, which it may be, will not be impertinent in the end. The firſt is, That the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> would not own that Party for Orthodox which was contrary to them, whom they accuſed neither of any Error in the Faith, nor any depravation of Worſhip, and that the Church on its ſide did not accuſe the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of any Hereſie in the Faith. For as for the Queſtion of the Validity or Invalidity of the Baptiſm of Hereticks, neither the one nor the other, made that the occaſion of their breach, and it was not upon that that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> founded their Separation. <hi>We confeſs both one ſort and the other,</hi> ſaid <hi>Creſconius, one and the ſame Jeſus Chriſt, born, dead and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. cont. Creſcon. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>riſen again. We have one and the ſame Religion, and the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and there is no difference between us about the practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>That their difference was not about</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. lib. de unit. Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>the head, but about the body; that is to ſay, that their diſpute was not about Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, but about his Church,</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>That they agreed in Baptiſm, in the Creed, and in the other Sacraments</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. Ep.</hi> 48.</note> 
                  <hi>of our Lord.</hi> All the pretence of this Rupture, was the perſonal faults of two or three Biſhops, which were not proved on one ſide, nor owned on the other, and whereof the greateſt part of the world had no knowledge. So that the Diſpute concerning the Church, was not between two Communions that conteſted one with the other about the purity of Doctrine, but between two Communions, which mutually acknowledg'd one another to be Orthodox, yet diſputed one with the other, the title of the quality of the Church of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Obſervation that I ſhall make is, that the oppoſite Party to the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and which the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> acknowledg'd to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97749:191"/>
be Orthodox, was then actually and in effect, ſpread over the whole Earth; that is to ſay, that it had a great extent among the Nations of it: whereas that of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> was ſhut up within one ſmall part of <hi>Africk.</hi> It was upon this, that they abuſed a paſſage of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> which they read after this manner, <hi>Tell</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 1. v. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>me (O thou whom my ſoul loveth) where thou feedeſt, where thou makeſt thy flocks to reſt in the South:</hi> explaining this <hi>in the South,</hi> as if he would have noted the place, and ſaid in <hi>Africa,</hi> whereas it ſhould be read at <hi>noon-day,</hi> meerly to note the hour of the day, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. lib. de unitat. Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 14.</note> when the Shepherd led his flock under ſome ſhade for their reſt. This is that which makes S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo ſpeak to them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the Apoſtolical Churches, and thoſe to whom S. <hi>John</hi> wrote his <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> with whom they had no communion, and to reproach them ſo often for being ſeparated from all the World.</p>
               <p>The third Obſervation is, That that Society which the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> acknowledged to be Orthodox, and which was in effect ſpread over many Nations, had not cut off the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> from its communion, nor had ſeparated the former from it; if they had not excommunicated them, nor pronounced <hi>Anathema's</hi> againſt thoſe who ſhould not hold <hi>Cecilianus</hi> to be innocent, or the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors</hi> to have been good men. When any one of them return'd to the Church, they did not ſeek to make them renounce any other thing than their Schiſm, nor to embrace any thing beſides peace. And even in the judgement of the Synod of <hi>Rome, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciades</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. Epiſt.</hi> 162</note> and his brethren, offered to hold communion with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops that <hi>Majorinus</hi> had ordained; and in the Conference at <hi>Carthage,</hi> they offered to the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Biſhops, to own them for <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Collat. Cart.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 16.</note> Biſhops, and to preſerve their Sees to them, without requiring any other condition of them, than that of brotherly Unity. It was therefore the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who ſeparated themſelves wilfully out of a meer ſpirit of diviſion, and the Church was in reſpect of them, in a paſſive Separation.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The fourth Obſervation is, That although the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſhould have had any juſt occaſion to ſeparate, yet they had urged their Separation notwithſtanding as far as it could go; for they had carried it ſo far, as even to break that general bond which yet in ſome manner united all thoſe who make an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal profeſſion of Chriſtianity good and bad, Orthodox and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, which yet in ſome manner make but one body, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Pagans and other people abſolutely Infidels. Their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97749:192"/>
Principle was, That all the Chriſtians in the World, except the party of <hi>Donatus,</hi> being ſullied with the contagion of the <hi>Traditor Cecilianus,</hi> all that they had alſo done became ſullied, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs of their perſons; and upon this Principle, they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Chriſtianity of the Univerſal Church, they rejected her Baptiſm, and her Sacraments, although at the bottom, they had the ſame with hers, and they look'd upon that Society to be no otherwiſe than an Aſſembly of Pagans and Infidels, with whom they would have nothing common. This is what St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches <note place="margin">

They make no ſcruple to ſay, that they know that out of their Sect there are no Chriſtians. You hold,</hi> ſayes he to them elſewhere, <hi>that all Chriſtian Holineſs has been aboliſh'd among the Nations where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had eſtabliſh'd it, becauſe they have communicated with thoſe whom your Fathers condemned in their Council of</hi> Carthage. Therefore it was that they thought themſelves grievouſly affronted, when the Catholicks called them their Brethren, they fled from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, they would not ſo much as ſit together with them, and they re-baptiz'd all thoſe who had been baptiz'd in the Church, when they came over to their Communion, neither more or leſs than if they had come out of Paganiſm, becauſe they maintained, that in effect the Church was abſolutely periſh'd, throughout all the Earth, except in their Party.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the matters of fact that I have thought my ſelf bound to explain. We muſt now return to the Objection of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Prejudices, and examine it in the meaning of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Fathers: the propoſition of which it is compoſed. The firſt is, <hi>That there is a Church from which it is never</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prejug. ch.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 102.</note> 
                  <hi>allow'd any man to ſeparate himſelf, under what pretence ſoever, and from which all thoſe who do ſo ſeparate themſelves, are Schiſmaticks.</hi> This firſt Propoſition is ambiguous, and ſo confuſed, that we can very hardly comprehend in what ſenſe the Author of the Prejudices has meant it. Every one knows that there is in the World a Body of people, or of Nations, who profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, and to whom one may yet, in ſome manner, give the name of the Church, becauſe that all ſuch Chriſtians are yet in ſome reſpect within the General Call of the Goſpel. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Church of which he means to ſpeak? But what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood is there, that to accuſe us of Schiſm, he ſhould have form'd ſo vagous an Idea of the Church, ſince he knows very
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97749:192"/>
well, that we are no more ſeparated from this body, than the other communions that compoſe it are, or than the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf in particular is? Every one knows that this body of Chriſtians is divided into divers communions, or particular Societies, that bear the name of Churches, as the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> the <hi>Coptick,</hi> the <hi>Jacobite,</hi> the <hi>Neſtorian,</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian:</hi> Does he mean any one of theſe Churches? But if that be ſo, why does he not diſtinctly and without any heſitation, tell us which it is, and if he would that it ſhould be that of <hi>Rome,</hi> what ground is there to believe that he would have it ſo? why did he not explain himſelf, why did he make an end, even to ſay, <hi>That</hi>

                  <hi>it ſhould be in our choice, whether that Church ſhould be the</hi> Greek, <hi>or the</hi> Neſtorian, <hi>or the</hi> Jacobites, <hi>and that he did not pretend to determine it?</hi> To what purpoſe are all theſe goings about? Every one knows yet that God alwayes preſerves in the world his truly faithful and his Children, who are the true Church, which he has predeſtinated to eternal Salvation. But the Author of the <hi>Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> has formerly declared himſelf againſt this notion of the Church, and he is ſo very earneſt to reject it, that we cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to him, without doing him wrong. We cannot even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he means, That we ought not to ſeparate our ſelves from a Communion, when it is Orthodox, and when thoſe who ſeparate themſelves from it are Schiſmaticks. For he has alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd himſelf againſt this Notion of the Church, <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſayes he, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 174.</note> 
                  <hi>in taking this way, the examination of Schiſm would be remitted to that of the Opinions, and that we muſt alwayes know, whether the Communion that they forſake, is Orthodox,</hi> which is that which he would avoid. What therefore is this Church? <hi>It is,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>the Catholick Church</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 177.</note> 
                  <hi>whereſoever it be.</hi> We are now as wiſe as we were before; for it alwayes remains to be enquir'd into, What is that Catholick Church. I freely confeſs, that it ſeems to me, that he would point it out to us, by a certain mark, which is the viſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion throughout all Nations; but in effect, he does it not: for he ſayes, in the end, that this is but a <hi>Negative</hi> mark, <hi>that is to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 184.</note> 
                  <hi>ſay, that every Society which has not that mark, is not the Church:</hi> So that according to him, this is a mark only proper to ſhew what it is not, and not to ſhew what it is. Whence therefore ſhall we know what this Church is? Moreover, his Propoſition is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ambiguous through the word <hi>Church,</hi> but it is further ſo, through that of <hi>Separation,</hi> for there is more than one ſort of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. There are ſuch as are unjuſt and criminal in their own
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97749:193"/>
nature, and there are others which are only ſo in cauſes and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; there are alſo ſuch as are permitted, and thoſe that deſerve to be condemned; there are neceſſary ones, and ſuch as are raſh; ſo that one cannot make any general propoſition upon this matter, which would not be captious, and proper to make a Fallacy. It is neceſſary therefore, in order to his acting with ſincerity, that the Author of the Prejudices ſhould openly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain his meaning, which he labours to eſtabliſh by the Authority of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and the other Fathers; and after having ſo cleared and eſtabliſh'd it, he ſhould propound his concluſion, that he would pretend to draw from it; for then, we ſhould ſee whether we ought to yield or deny it. But to begin a <hi>convincing</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a principle ſo vagous and ſo confuſed as this that we have ſeen, and even to affect that confuſion, without being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to explain himſelf, is in my judgement, a procedure very fit to be ſuſpected, and which may juſtly make us doubt, that inſtead of a <hi>convincing</hi> argument, he gives us nothing but a Fallacy.</p>
               <p>To clear this doubt, it will be here neceſſary to give a clear and diſtinct Idea of the Doctrine of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject about which we are diſputing. Firſt, Then we muſt know, that this Father acknowledg'd, that the truly Faithful only, and the truly Juſt, in oppoſition to the Wicked, the Wordly, Infidels and Hereticks, were the true Church properly ſo called; and this is what may be proved by an infinite number of paſſages. <hi>It muſt not be imagin'd,</hi> ſayes he, in his anſwer to <hi>Petilianus, that the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>wicked belong to the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which is the Church, under a pretence that they corporally partake of the Sacraments. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are holy even in ſuch perſons; but they ſerve only to increaſe their condemnation, becauſe they give and receive them unworthily. And as for them, they are not in that aſſembly of the Church of Jeſus Chriſt, which conſiſting in his members, increaſes by being compacted and fitly joyned with the increaſe of God. For this Church is built upon a Rock, according to what our Saviour ſaid, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Rock I will build my Church, and the others are only built upon the ſand, as the ſame Lord ſaid, I will liken him who heareth my words, and doth not what they teach, to a fooliſh man who built his houſe upon the ſand.</hi> And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Both the good and the wicked may baptize; but there is but one</hi>

                     <hi>Aug. contr. Creſcon. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>only God, alwayes good, who can waſh the conſcience. The wicked are therefore at preſent condemned by Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they have a wicked and defiled conſcience, and at preſent, they are not of his Body</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:97749:193"/>
                  <hi>which is the Church, although the Church her ſelf is ignorant that they are not; for Jeſus Chriſt cannot have any of his members condemned. So that they baptize, being themſelves out of the Church. For God is not pleaſed that all theſe Monſters ſhould be reckon'd among the members of that only Dove, nor that they ſhould enter into his encloſed Garden, the keeper whereof can never be deceiv'd.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>Whether they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. de Bapt. contr. Donat. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeem to be in the Church, or whether they be openly diſcover'd to be out of it, that which is fleſh is alwayes fleſh. That the chaff, as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, flyes in the air, whether it be blown thither by the occaſion of ſome temptation, as by the wind, or no, it is alwayes chaff. Thoſe who being hardned by carnality, are mingled in the Aſſembly of the Saints, ceaſe not to be ſeparated from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of that Church which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot or wrinkle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore certain, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> acknowledg'd none to be properly the Church, but the truly Faithful and truly Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But becauſe that theſe faithful and theſe righteous are mix'd with the wicked, the worldly, and Hereticks, in the circle of the ſame External Call, as the chaff is with the good ſeed in the ſame Floor, or as the Tares are mingled with the good Wheat in the ſame Field: We muſt note, in the ſecond place, that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> gives another notion of the Church, which he calls the <hi>mixed Church,</hi> and it is to explain this notion, that he ſets before <note place="margin">Aug. paſſim.</note> us all the compariſons that the Scripture makes uſe of to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the mixture of the good with the bad in the ſame Call; that of the field, where the Son of Man caſt his ſeed, and where the Enemy aroſe in the night and ſowed his Tares alſo, ſo that the Wheat and the Tares muſt grow there together till the time of harveſt; that of the Net that the Fiſherman caſt into the Sea, and which incloſed equally the good and bad Fiſh; that of the Floor, where the good Grain is mixed with the Chaff; and that of the Houſe, in which there are Veſſels of Gold and Silver, and others of Wood and Earth. It is for the ſame thing that he makes uſe of the diſtinction <hi>of the true body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the mixed body of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> meaning by <hi>true,</hi> the truly faithful and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. de Doctr. Chr. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 32.</note> only, and by <hi>mixed,</hi> the faithful and righteous joyned with thoſe who are not ſo; and that both together by reaſon of their mixture in one and the ſame external call, make in a manner but one and the ſame body. He makes uſe for the ſame purpoſe of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. de Bapt. contr. Donat. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 51.</note> the diſtinction, of being of the Church, and being in the Church, and he would that none but the truly faithful and righteous <hi>are of the Church;</hi> but that the others are in the Church; and by this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97749:194"/>
means he forms two Idea's of the Church, the one diſtinct, and the other confuſed; the diſtinct reſtrains the Church preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe in whom ſhe properly conſiſts, and who are her true members, and theſe are the truly righteous and faithful; but the confuſed, includes all thoſe who externally profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, the good Wheat and the Tares, the Chaff and the good Seed, the good and the bad Fiſh, the Veſſels of Gold and Silver, and thoſe of Wood and Earth; and in this confus'd notion, the Church is the Field, the Floor, the Net, and the Houſe that the holy Scripture ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p>But as this mixture which I have ſpoken of, may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood two wayes; either in reſpect of Manners, or in regard of Doctrines; we muſt note in the Third place, that this notion of the Mixed Church according to S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is divided into two, for he would have us ſometimes conceive of it, as a Body wherein the righteous are only mingled with the unrighteous, that is to ſay, with the wicked, whoſe manners are vitious and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and ſometimes alſo, he would have us conceive it, as a Body where the Hereticks are mixed with the truly faithful, as well as the righteous with the unrighteous. In the former caſe the mixed Church is a pure communion in reſpect of Doctrine; but corrupted in regard of manners: and in the ſecond, it is a communion not only corrupted, in regard of manners; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure alſo and corrupted, in regard of its Tenets. Theſe two ſorts of mixture are without doubt in the Hypotheſis of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine;</hi> the firſt made all the ground of his diſpute againſt the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> and as for the ſecond, he often explains himſelf in his Books, and particularly in the Pſalms againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> where <note place="margin">Aug. Pſ. contr. Donat.</note> he ſayes, <hi>That after Jeſus Chriſt had purged his floor by the preaching of the Croſs, the righteous were as the new ſeed which he ſpread abroad over all the Earth, to the end they ſhould make another harveſt at the end of the world. But that this harveſt grew up amidſt the Tares,</hi> becauſe there are Hereſies every where. <hi>Haec meſſis creſcit inter zizania quia ſunt haereſes ubique.</hi> In that ſame Pſalm and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in divers places, he quotes the Example of the Jewiſh Church, in which he ſaies, that the Saints, the Prophets and the righteous were mixed not only with the wicked, whoſe manners were debauched and criminal, but alſo with the ſuperſtitious and <hi>Idolaters;</hi> that which leaves no difficulty about it; for Idolatry is the greateſt of all Hereſies.</p>
               <p>We muſt note in the Fourth place, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would have
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97749:194"/>
us conſider the mixed Church in two different States. For as for that which reſpects mens manners, he ſayes, that ſometimes the wicked do not prevail over the righteous, either in number, or Authority; but that ſometimes alſo, they prevail in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the good are often oppreſs'd under their multitude, and this is that which he treats particularly of in his Third Book againſt <hi>Parmenianus.</hi> And ſo in regard of Hereſies, he means, that ſometimes they grow ſo powerful, as to infect almoſt all the Body: and this is what he expreſly ſhews in a Letter to <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. Ep.</hi> 48. <hi>&amp; Ep.</hi> 80.</note> a <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Biſhop, and in that which he wrote to <hi>Heſychius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has conceiv'd of the Church, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe different notions, and theſe different ſtates, he has ſpoken differently of ſeparations from it. As for that which regards the truly righteous and faithful, there is no queſtion, but that he thought that we ought to have not only an internal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of charity with them founded upon the Unity that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the members of the Myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt, who have all but one and the ſame faith, one and the ſame piety and the ſame righteouſneſs; but an external communion alſo, which conſiſts in joyning with them in the ſame Aſſemblies, in parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſame Sacraments, in approving their faith, piety, good works; and in one word, in accounting them their brethren, as far as it is poſſible for them to know them. But this is not that which makes the difficulty, all the Queſtion is concerning the mixed Church, and all the diſpute is to know how, according to S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the Corn and the Tares, that is to ſay, the truly faithful and the Hereticks, ought to remain together in the ſame communion, and in what caſe they might ſeparate themſelves. We muſt therefore note in the Fifth place, that in the Doctrine of that Father, there is a certain ſeparation that a man can never make, under any pretence whatſoever, without being a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; and that there is another that he may lawfully make, and which it is ſometimes neceſſary that he ſhould. He has diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd between two external bonds that ſhould unite us to one another; the firſt is, that of the External and General Call to Chriſtianity, the ſecond is that of the participation of the ſame Sacraments, and the ſame Aſſemblies. It is the firſt bond that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would have to be inviolable, not only in regard of the faithful between themſelves; but alſo in regard of the wicked and Hereticks, and not only while we ſuffer them to be in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies; but even then when we excommunicate them,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97749:195"/>
and deprive them of the communion of the Sacraments. And thus it is that he underſtands that which Jeſus Chriſt ſaid in his Parable, <hi>That the Tares ought not to be pluck'd up which the Enemy had</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 13. v. 29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>ſown among the good Wheat in the ſame field; but that he would leave both to grow together until the harveſt:</hi> and it is this kind of Unity whereof he ſayes, that there is no juſt neceſſity of ever breaking: <hi>praecidendae unitatis nulla eſt juſta neceſſitas,</hi> it is the Unity of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. contr. Ep. Parmen. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>ſame Net that enclos'd both good and bad Fiſh, the Unity of the ſame Floor that contain'd both the good Seed and the Chaff; the Unity of the ſame Field where the Tares grew up with the Wheat, the Unity of the</hi> ſame <hi>Houſe</hi> where there are Veſſels of Wood and Earth, with thoſe of Gold and Silver: and in a word, this Unity that we call the external and general call to Chriſtianity. It is therefore firſt of all, in this ſenſe that he means, that there is a Church from which we ought never to ſeparate our ſelves, under any pretence whatſoever, and from which all thoſe who ſeparate themſelves are Schiſmaticks; for he underſtands it of that mixed Church, that Field, that Floor, that Net, that common Houſe, out of which we muſt never go forth, nor drive out others, howſoever wicked and Heretical they may be, there being none but God who can make this ſeparation, and who will in effect make it at the end of the world. And as it was thus that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had ſeparated themſelves, ſo it was chiefly upon this, that he convinced them of Schiſm; for they own'd none for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but thoſe of their own Party; they rejected the Baptiſm of all the reſt; they looked upon them as Pagans, who had no more any ſhadow of Chriſtianity; and when Proſelytes came over to them, they made them paſs through all the degrees of the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> before they would receive them; and they began to make them Chriſtians anew, as if they had come out of a Society of abſolute Infidels, as I have noted in my Fourth Obſervation on their Story. This Diſtinction that I have of theſe two ſorts of ſeparation, is clearly to be found in the Doctrine of S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. contr. Ep. Parmen. l.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> He notes both the one and the other in his third Book againſt <hi>Parmenio,</hi> where he treats of this matter very largely. <hi>When any brother, ſayes he, that is to ſay, any Chriſtian among thoſe who are in the Society of the Church, falls into ſo great ſins, that they judge worthy of an</hi> Anathema, <hi>I would have them proceed to his Excommunication, if that may be done without any danger of Schiſm; but yet it ought to be done with that charity that S.</hi> Paul <hi>recommends to us, to wit, that we ſhould not treat him as an Enemy, but as a Brother; for you are</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:97749:195"/>
                  <hi>not called to pluck up, but to correct. If he does not acknowledge nor correct his fault by repentance, he wilfully goes out of himſelf from the Church, and it will be his own will that ſeparates him from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity. Our Lord himſelf ſaid to his ſervants, when they would pluck up the Tares mixed with the Wheat, leave them to grow up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther until harveſt; and he gives the reaſon, to wit, leſt, ſayes he, that in plucking up the Tares, you pluck up the Wheat alſo.</hi> See here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely theſe two ſeparations whereof I ſpeak, the one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives one of the communion of the Sacraments, and the other which breaks of Chriſtian Unity; one which is but to <hi>correct,</hi> and the other which goes as far as to <hi>pluck up.</hi> This Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. cap.</hi> 1.</note> for the ſame thing, the Example of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in the Excommunication of the Inceſtuous perſon in <hi>Corinth,</hi> did indeed deliver that miſerable perſon to Satan; but only <hi>for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit might be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> that is to ſay, that he depriv'd him of the communion of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but that he did not wholly <hi>pluck him up</hi> out of the field <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> of the Church. He alledges yet further, what the ſame Apoſtle wrote to the <hi>Theſſalonians, If any man obey not our word by this</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3. v. 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be aſhamed, yet count him not as an enemy; but admoniſh him as a brother.</hi> He alledges laſtly, that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> touching the ſame inceſtuous penitent, that they ought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him; <hi>Leſt Satan ſhould get an advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his devices. What means the Apoſtle, ſayes he, by theſe words, leſt Satan ſhould get an advantage over us, for we are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his devices? It is that under the appearance of a juſt ſeverity, he ſometimes perſwades to a violent cruelty, deſiring nothing more than to break the bond of peace and charity, well knowing that while that bond ſhall be preſerved among Chriſtians, he cannot hurt them, and that his devices and deſigns would vaniſh.</hi> There cannot be a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect example of that firſt ſeparation given, than that of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi> in reſpect of the Church; for as I have ſaid already, they ſo abſolutely ſeparated themſelves from it, that they did not own it to be any longer Chriſtian in any manner, and therefore it was that they re-baptiz'd all thoſe, who came over to their party. But we cannot alſo give a better example of the ſecond, than that of the Church it ſelf, in regard of the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> for although they would ſeparate themſelves from the Church, yet the Church did not fail to look upon them as Chriſtians, and in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as Brethren. <hi>The Donatiſts,</hi> ſayes S. <hi>Auguſtine, are impious in</hi>

                  <hi>going about to re-baptize all the world; but as for us who have better ſentiments, we dare not even diſapprove of the Sacraments of God in a Schiſmatical Communion. In reſpect of the things about which we agree, they are yet with us; and in reſpect of the things about which we differ, they are ſeparated from us. This approach to us, and this ſeparation, are not ordered by the motions of the body, but by thoſe of the mind; and as the union of bodies is made by the continuity of the places they fill up, ſo the union of ſpirits alſo is made by the conſent of wills. If thoſe who have forſaken the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church, do other things than thoſe that are done in the Church, they are in that regard ſeparated from her, but if they do that which is done in the Church they remain as yet in that regard in a common union. The</hi> Donatiſts <hi>are therefore with us in ſome things, and they are ſeparated from us in ſome others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot here avoid taking notice of the Error into which the Author of the Prejudices ſeems to have fallen, about the meaning of theſe words of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the ſecond Book againſt <hi>Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus, praecidendae unitatis nulla eſt juſta neceſſitas. There is no juſt neceſſity to break off <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> For it ſeems that he thought that this Maxim regarded all manner of ſeparation, not conſidering, that it only reſpects that of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> which conſiſted in the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the general bond of Chriſtianity, and not that which conſiſts in refuſing our communion to thoſe who corrupt Religion by their pernicious Superſtitions and Errors. If he had taken the pains to have read ten or twelve lines higher, he had found that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> had ſtrongly eſtabliſh'd the neceſſity of ſeparating our ſelves from Hereticks. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſayes that Father, <hi>writing to the</hi> Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <note place="margin">

If any one ſhould preach another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to you than what you have received, let him be Anathema.</hi> He would that we ſhould pronounce an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt thoſe who preach to us any thing beyond what we have received. He would elſewhere, that there can be no juſt neceſſity of breaking of unity: Who ſees not that he muſt make a diſtinction, and that according to him, there is a ſeparation that is good, juſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and another unjuſt, unlawful and ſchiſmatical?</p>
               <p>Although this Diſtinction is unqueſtionable, yet I ſhall not fail to produce here a Canon that eſtabliſhes it, out of the very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as clearly as we can deſire it.

They ſay alſo, that this contrary to S.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>who aſſures us, that we ought not to divide its unity, and that we muſt tolerate the wicked and not reject them. But, firſt of all, we anſwer, that if we ought not to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the Hereticks and the wicked, S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>would have done ill to have joyn'd himſelf to the Legates of the Holy Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and to the other Holy Biſhops to excommunicate</hi> Pelagius <hi>and</hi> Celeſtinus, <hi>and to ſeparate them from the Church, becauſe they brought in a new Hereſie into it. But why alſo did the ſame S.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>with the whole Church of God, hold the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>to be juſtly excommunicated, againſt whom theſe things are written; and why did not they receive them into their communion, but only after ſigns of repentance, and the impoſition of hands?</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>who propounded the Parable of the Tares, did not he clearly ordain excommunication, elſewhere, ſaying, that if our brother would not obey the Church correcting him, we ought to reckon him as a Heathen and a Publican? That which manifeſtly ſhews us, that it is one thing to excommunicate, and another to pluck up; the Diſcipline of the Church excommunicates, but it does not pluck up.</hi> See here preciſely that which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf ſaid, <hi>non eſtis ad eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candum, ſed ad corrigendum.</hi> From whence the truth of that which I have ſaid appears, that according to this Father, there is a bad ſeparation, and that is ſchiſmatical in its own nature, and another that is not ſo; and that although it is never permitted us to make the former; yet it does not follow, that we may not make the latter, provided we do it upon juſt cauſes, and obſerve the rules of Prudence and Charity in it.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore lay it down as a certain truth, that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> thought, that we might ſometimes break the communion of the Sacraments and Aſſemblies, we are only concerned to know in what caſe he thought that that ſeparation ſhould be made.</p>
               <p>To make this point clear, I ſhall ſay, in the Sixth place, that when S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> conſidered the Church in the meer mixture with the wicked; that is to ſay, in the mixture with thoſe whoſe manners are vicious and criminal, he taught, that thoſe who are in office in the Church, may proceed to the excommunication of impenitent ſinners, when thoſe ſinners are few in number, and when there is ground to believe, that they may diſturb the peace of the Church; but if the crime includes a whole multitude, and that the Body in general is infected, then he would that the good ſhould content themſelves to preſerve their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97749:197"/>
without partaking of the ſins of the wicked, he would that they ſhould groan under it, and pray to God; but he would not that they ſhould ſeparate themſelves. <hi>When the evil,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>has ſeized the greater number, nothing remains for the good to do, but to groan and lament.</hi> And a little lower, <hi>If the contagion of ſin has</hi>

                  <hi>invaded the multitude, then it is neceſſary that Diſcipline ſhould be uſed with mercy, for the counſels of Separation are vain, pernicious and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious.</hi> But when he conſiders the Church, not only as a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of good and wicked; but alſo as a mixture of the truly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Hereticks, I maintain that he has formally acknowledg'd the juſtice and neceſſity of a ſeparation, not only in regard of ſome particular perſons; but in regard even of entire Societies, provided they go not ſo far as that which he calls <hi>Eradication.</hi> We have already noted that he would that we ſhould according to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> pronounce an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt thoſe who preach ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel, than that which he has preached. But this very thing gives the faithful a right to reject the communion of Heretical Societies, and to ſeparate themſelves from their Aſſemblies. In his Book of the True Religion, he aggravates it as a very ſtrange thing, and very much deſerving to be condemn'd, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers who had other ſentiments concerning Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than the people, ſhould partake in the worſhip of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>In their Schools,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>they had ſentiments differing from</hi>

                  <hi>thoſe of the people, and yet notwithſtanding they had Temples common with the people. The people and their Prieſts were not ignorant that theſe Philoſophers had opinions contrary to theirs touching the nature of the Gods, ſince every Philoſopher was not afraid of publiſhing his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of labouring at the ſame time to perſwade them and others, and yet nevertheleſs with that diverſity of ſentiments, they did not fail to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt at the publick worſhip without being hindred by any body.</hi> A man that ſpeaks after this manner, would not think it ill, that any ſhould ſeparate themſelves from Heretical communions. But he yet further explains himſelf more clearly afterwards. For he ſayes, <hi>That if the Chriſtian Religion ſhould do nothing elſe but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. cap.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>that vice, it would deſerve infinite praiſes.</hi> And he adds imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after, <hi>That it appears by the example of ſo many Hereſies that have deviated from the rule of Chriſtianity, that they would not admit to the communion of the Sacraments thoſe who taught concerning God the Father, his Wiſdom and his Grace, otherwiſe than the truth would allow them, and who would perſwade men to receive their falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.—But that is not only to be found true in regard of the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97749:197"/>
                  <hi>and of ſome others who have other Sacraments than we, but alſo in regard of thoſe who having the ſame Sacraments, have ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments differing from us in other things, and errors which they obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately defend; for they are ſhut out from the Catholick communion, and the participation of thoſe ſame Sacraments which they have common with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence comes it to paſs therefore, you will ſay, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſeems ſometimes to aſcribe to the Orthodox the right only of a paſſive ſeparation, in regard of Heretical Societies? that is to ſay, that he would not that we ſhould ſeparate from them even then when they ſeparate themſelves. For he ſayes in ſome place, that though the <hi>Traditors</hi> ſhould have openly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Church, that their Action was good and holy, that is to ſay, that they ought to have delivered up their Bibles to the Pagans for them to burn them, and that though they ſhould even have wrote on that ſubject, <hi>provided they had not ſet up their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies</hi>

                  <hi>apart, nor ſeparated themſelves, yet we ought not to have abandoned, for them, the good wheat:</hi> which ſignifies this to us, that we ought not to ſeparate our ſelves from thoſe, though their Doctrine whereof he had ſpoken was deteſtable, contrary to the faith, conſcience and good manners. In effect, he ſpeaks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt alwayes of the Heretical Societies of his time, as of thoſe who were themſelves cut off from the communion of the Church, and whom the Church had not rejected. I anſwer, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would have us ſuffer the communion of Hereticks in certain caſes, but that he would have us alſo in other caſes to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our ſelves from them. While we are in no danger of partaking with their errors, neither in effect, nor in appearance; but that we may preſerve the profeſſion of our faith pure, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to impiety, or ſeeming to conſent to it, and that there ſhould not be on the part of the Hereticks that obſtinacy of opinion, he would have us ſuffer their communion. For it is the manifeſt Doctrine of this Father, that in the Society of the Church, no one is reſponſible but for his own crimes, and not for thoſe of others, at leaſt if he take no part with them, or do not approve them, or conſent to them. So that, while there is no obſtinateneſs to maintain error, while there is no danger of being ſeduced, and while one is not bound to take any part in the evil, nor to hide ones faith and piety under the vail of hypocriſie, this Father yields, that we ſhould have communion with Hereticks, as the ancient Prophets had communion with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97749:198"/>
the Idolaters of their times, and as Jeſus Chriſt and his Diſciples had communion with the Phariſees and Sadducees, and were found among them in the ſame Aſſemblies. But when there is an invincible opinionativeneſs, and error is ſo deeply rooted, that there is no more hope of its being healed, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would, in this caſe, that a man ſhould ſeparate himſelf from their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. This is that which he teaches in the ſame Book of the True Religion, <hi>The Church,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>ſuffers their error, while they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>have no accuſers, or do not defend their falſe opinions with obſtinacy; but when they are accuſed, and defend themſelves obſtinately in their opinions, ſhe ſeparates them from her communion,</hi> which is formally to acknowledge the right of active ſeparation in an Orthodox Church. And from the ſame we may evidently conclude, that this Father does not approve that we ſhould remain in an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Communion, when there is the leaſt neceſſity of partaking in error, wickedneſs, or ſuperſtition, whether in effect or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and that he would on the contrary conclude, that in this caſe the good ſhould ſeparate themſelves for the conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own righteouſneſs. But to give a yet greater light to this matter, we muſt note, that according to the Doctrine of this Father, every Society whatſoever it be, that determines a falſe Doctrine, and publiſhes Books of it, to teach it poſterity, and who will have none receive its communion, but thoſe who approve that Doctrine, in giving the Orthodox a juſt occaſion to ſeparate themſelves, ſhe her ſelf firſt of all breaks the bond of Unity, and it is ſhe that makes the active ſeparation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſchiſmatical. This is that which he teaches in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe againſt <hi>Creſconius.</hi> This <hi>Donatiſt</hi> had ſaid to him, that if he did not approve of the crime of the <hi>Traditors,</hi> if on the contrary it diſpleaſed him, he ought to fly from and abandon the Church of the <hi>Traditors.</hi> To anſwer to this, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes, firſt of all, that though there ſhould have been <hi>Traditors</hi> in his Church, yet he ought not to forſake it, while he did not communicate with their crime; and that on the contrary, he condemned it, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to correct it by preaching and diſcipline. He proves it by the example of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who declaimed againſt the vices of the Church; but who did not ſeparate himſelf from it: and by that of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Samuel,</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> of <hi>Zachary,</hi> and other Saints, who cryed out againſt the Tranſgreſſors of the Law, yet without ſeparating themſelves notwithſtanding. Since immediately after he adds, <hi>Is it that the Traditors have inſtituted</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Contr. Creſcon. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 38.</note>

                  <hi>ſome new Sacraments, or ſome new Baptiſm? Is it that they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Books to teach others to do or imitate the action of the Traditors, or that they have recommended thoſe Books to poſterity, or that we hold and follow that Doctrine? If they had done ſo, and ſuffered no perſon to have been in their communion, but thoſe who would read their Books, and approve that Doctrine, I ſay, that they would have ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church, and if you ſaw me in their Schiſm, you would then have reaſon to ſay, that I were in the Church of the Traditors.</hi> Theſe words note clearly what I have ſaid, that when a Church teaches a falſe Doctrine, which it makes to enter into the uſe of the Sacraments, and that it would receive into its communion, none but thoſe who approve it, it is not only juſt to ſeparate from her, but it is ſhe her ſelf that breaks the bond of the Unity of the Church, and caſts her ſelf into Schiſm. But this is preciſely that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does in reſpect of us; for ſhe has not only decided as of faith, the Doctrines that we do not believe to be true; ſhe has not only ſet forth Books to teach thoſe Tenets to Poſterity, but ſhe has cut off all thoſe from her communion, who will not believe them after the manner that ſhe teaches them. So that we have in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard a juſt reaſon to ſay, that it is ſhe that has made the active ſeparation; and if it be true, that we have reaſon in the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is ſhe that has broken the Chriſtian Unity, and to which the Schiſm ought to be imputed, and not to us, who are in a meer paſſive ſeparation. From whence by the way, it further follows, that to the deciding the Queſtion of the Schiſm that is between us, and to know which of the two parties is to blame, we muſt neceſſarily come to the diſcuſſion of the controverted Articles. For if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has decided nothing, that is not conformable to the Goſpel, ſhe has a right to reject all thoſe from her communion, who refuſe to believe her Doctrine; we will grant this: But if ſhe has decided Errors, it is certain alſo, that the neceſſity which ſhe has impoſed on others to believe and practiſe them in order to their being in her communion, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her guilty of Schiſm. All depends therefore on the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the foundation. For there is no ground left of doubting that according to the Doctrine of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> it is not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but even neceſſary to the Orthodox in ſome certain caſes, to be no longer joyned in the aſſemblies of thoſe who teach thoſe errors, and to live ſeparated from their communion. We ſhall ſee in the cloſe, whether that multitude and viſible
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97749:199"/>
extenſion can take away that right from a ſmall party reſtrain'd to a few perſons and places; for there remains nothing but this doubt to be taken away; but to effect this, we muſt go on to the examination of the ſecond Propoſition of the Author of the Prejudices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The infallible and perpetual mark,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>to know the Church by, according to S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>and the other</hi> African <hi>Fathers, is a viſible extenſion throughout all Nations; becauſe that viſible extenſion according to them, agreed with the Church in all Ages, and that it is a negative mark; that is to ſay, that every Society which has not that extenſion, is not the Church; ſo that this arguing is alwayes juſt; your Society is ſhut up in a ſmall part of the world: therefore it is not the Church. It is,</hi> adds he, <hi>by this principle, that S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>has diſputed againſt the</hi> Donatiſts, <hi>and convinc'd them to be ſchiſmaticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Propoſition is not leſs captious, nor leſs ambiguous than the former. For if the Author of the Prejudices means, that that viſible extenſion is a perpetual mark of the Orthodox commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that alwayes diſtinguiſhes it from impure or heretical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, ſo that this Orthodox communion, as far as it is viſible, can never be reſtrained to a few perſons and places, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this was not the opinion of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> nor that of the other Fathers; and it is certain alſo, that the celebrated Authors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> reject the Propoſition in this ſenſe, as falſe and abſurd; and that in effect, it is manifeſtly contrary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. To ſet forth the truth of what I propound, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with experience, and as that of our Age preſents it ſelf firſt to our view; I ſay, that if we muſt act at this day according to the principle, That the true Orthodox Church ought to be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly extended over all Nations, we muſt conclude, that there is no true Orthodox Church in the world. For it is moſt true, that of all the communions which at this day divide Chriſtianity, there is not any one to whom this mark can agree. I will not ſay, that there are divers parties in the known world which have not ſo much as yet heard of Chriſtianity, nor that there are others who after having received it, have abſolutely rejected it to embrace the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion. I will not here ſpeak of the <hi>Greek</hi> communion ſeparated from the <hi>Roman,</hi> nor of the <hi>Coptick</hi> or <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian,</hi> or of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> or <hi>Armenian,</hi> which evidently have not that viſible extenſion throughout all Nations. I will only ſpeak of the <hi>Roman</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> as they are at preſent. <hi>He muſt,</hi>

                  <hi>maintain, that the ſociety of</hi> Calviniſts, <hi>which is wholly ſhut out of</hi> Italy, Spain, Flanders, <hi>a great part of</hi> Germany, Swedeland, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, Muſcovy, Aſia, Africa, <hi>of almoſt all</hi> America, <hi>is that which Jeſus Chriſt has ſpread over all the world.</hi> But before he argues after this manner, he ought to take heed, that we cannot ſay the ſame thing of the <hi>Roman</hi> communion. For is it not true, that it is at this day excluded from <hi>Swedeland, Denmark,</hi> a great part of <hi>Germany,</hi> a part of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> a part of <hi>Greece, Muſcovy, Africa, Aethiopia, Perſia, Tartary, China, Japan,</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and from the greateſt part of <hi>America?</hi> And the Author of the Prejudices ought not to pretend the prevailing of ſome Colonies of Miſſionaries whom the Pope ſends here and there to gain Proſelytes. For ſince he will not have it, that we ſhould gain any thing by the Colonies of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have eſtabliſh'd themſelves in all the parts of the world, why would he help himſelf by the Miſſionaries and Penſionaries that the Congregations <hi>de fide propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> maintain in foreign Countreys? Why ſhould they be more reckon'd for any thing, than thoſe Colonies of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have the exerciſes of their Religion, as free as thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion? <hi>They are,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>ſuch Merchants as are in</hi>

                  <hi>thoſe Countreys, only for the ſake of Trade.</hi> But do not thoſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants pray to God in the form of their Religion, in what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, and with what deſign ſoever they are? Is it that thoſe Merchants being ſo much ty'd as they are to their Trading, make no open profeſſion of their Religion, or that they have not in the greateſt part of thoſe places where they are, their ordinary Aſſemblies, with their Miniſters, as well as the Miſſionaries? He muſt yield in good earneſt, that the Chriſtians are now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and ſeparated from one another, about matters of faith and worſhip, in their different Societies, or communions, of which each one has its ſeat and bounds apart, beyond which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay they are viſibly extended, if we would ſpeak with any reaſon; and that there is no one that is throughout all Nations in the form of a communion of viſible Society. From whence it follows, that all this diſpute of the Author of the Prejudices, is but a beating the air, and which he can never apply to any real ſubject.</p>
               <p>The Experience of former Ages is not leſs contrary to the Propoſition of the Author of the Prejudices, than that of our Age. For if we conſult Hiſtory, we ſhall find, that it has fallen out often, that an Heretical communion has ſpread it ſelf every

where, while the Orthodox communion was ſo limited, that it did not ſeem to take up any ſpace. If in the time of the <hi>Arians,</hi> they had diſputed by this principle, by which the Author of the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices would decide our differences; I mean if they would have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that communion as Heretical, that was not viſibly ſpread over all the Nations, and that as Orthodox which was, the <hi>Arians</hi> had eaſily overcome. <hi>The Hereſie of the</hi> Arians <hi>and</hi> Eunomians, ſayes S. <hi>Jerom, poſſeſs'd all the Eaſt, except</hi> Athanaſius <hi>and</hi> Paulinus. <note place="margin">Hieron. contr. error.

                  <hi>that the Catholick Church ſhould have that extenſion in all places, all at once, or in the ſame time, that is to ſay, that there ſhould be the faithful in all Provinces, and that it is enough if that be ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively done.</hi> From whence it follows, that when there ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main but one Province alone that ſhould retain the true Faith, this Province would not fail to be truly and properly called the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, <hi>provided that we ſee clearly that it is the ſame Church, which ſometimes or at divers times, is found ſpread over all the</hi>

                  <hi>world.</hi> Could any one have more clearly contradicted the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Prejudices? He would that this viſible extenſion through all Nations ſhould be a <hi>perpetual</hi> mark of the True Church; and theſe here ſay, that it is ſufficient that it is <hi>ſometimes,</hi> and even in divers times <hi>ſucceſſively,</hi> he would that this extenſion ſhould be the mark of the Church <hi>for all following Ages;</hi> and theſe here maintain, that it is not neceſſary. He would that this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning ſhould be alwayes juſt, your ſociety is ſhut up in a ſmall part of the world.

               <p>But it may be that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had not obſerved, that his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and <hi>Driedo</hi>'s favoured the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and that it was contrary to the doctrine of S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> This may be ſo in effect; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man in writing may not have all things in view, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo, at the bottom, the ſentiment of theſe Doctors is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from that of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and that it does not encounter that of S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> It is yet true, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaw that they could make that Objection, which he has prevented and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; this I ſay, to the end the Author of the Prejudices may ſee, that this which he has treated of as an Argument, and as a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing</hi> Argument for which he has made two Chapters, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> has look'd on as a very trivial objection, which he propoſes and reſolves in a few words. <hi>They will ſay,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that this is to fall into the Error of</hi> Petilianus <hi>and the</hi> Donatiſts, <hi>who maintain'd that in truth the Church had been ſpread over all the world, but that it was afterwards loſt in all the Provinces, and remain'd no where but in</hi> Africa, <hi>which S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>diſputes againſt. I anſwer, that the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>conſiſted in two things; the firſt, that they would have it that the Church ſhould be in</hi> Africa <hi>only in a time wherein it manifeſtly increaſed throughout all the world: the ſecond, in that they could not connect their Church of</hi> Africa <hi>with that which had before been ſpread through all the world; for in that Church there, they had alwayes good and bad, as S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>proves, whereas they would compoſe theirs of the righteous only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Anſwer of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> overthrows all the pretenſions of the Author of the Prejudices; for it eſtabliſhes theſe following Propoſitions. 1. That Viſible Extenſion is not a mark of the true Church, but in a certain time, that is to ſay, when we ſee it manifeſtly increaſe throughout all the world; from whence it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97749:202"/>
follows, that this mark is vain at other times. 2. That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concludes only for the time then being, by reaſon of that manifeſt fruitfulneſs; from whence it follows, that it is very impertinent, that the Author of the Prejudices goes to apply it to theſe laſt Ages, wherein we maintain the field of the Church has been fruitful only in Errors and Superſtitions. 3. That if the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had accuſed all the world to have fallen into Hereſie, and if they had ſaid, by conſequence, that it was not the time of fruitfulneſs for the Church, it had been in vain for S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to alledge to them the viſible extenſion of his Church, to exempt himſelf from entring into the diſcuſſion of that accuſation; from whence it follows, that it is alſo in vain that the Author of the Prejudices propounds the viſible extenſion of his, ſince we ſay that it is fallen into fundamental errors. 4. That the Argument of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concluded, becauſe the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> agreed, that his communion was Orthodox; from whence it follows, that that of the Author of the Prejudices concludes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſince we queſtion that Orthodoxy of his Church. 5. That by conſequence viſible extenſion is not a mark, that can make us know which is the True Church, when the diſpute is between two Societies conteſting that Orthodoxy between themſelves, but at fartheſt only when the diſpute is between two Societies that mutually own one another to be Orthodox; from whence it follows, that the Author of the Prejudices makes uſe of this mark to no purpoſe, ſince our chief queſtion is to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Orthodox or no. All theſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, which flow naturally from the anſwer of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Argument of the Author of the Prejudices; and it concerns him to ſee after what manner he can decline the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Cardinal.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, laſtly, It may be <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was deceived, and that he had not well underſtood the ſtate of the queſtion, which was between S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> nor well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the true Hypotheſis of that Father. I confeſs that this may be; but it may be alſo, that he did well underſtand it, and that the miſconſtruing ſhould be on the ſide of the Author of the Prejudices. This is that which muſt be further cleared, and for this effect, we muſt note a thing that the Author of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices ſeems not to have comprized; which is, that if the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> had accuſed the Society of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of Hereſie, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had been very well able to have prov'd, that they were Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97749:203"/>
but that he had not notwithſtanding been able to conclude from thence, that his Society was the True Church. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this is, becauſe they had broken the general bond of an External Call, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would have them obliged to keep, even in regard of Hereticks; ſo that according to him, they might very well have been Schiſmaticks, although the Church which they had forſaken had not been the true Church. He prov'd therefore, that his Society was the true Church, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they acknowledg'd it to be Orthodox, and did not lay to its charge either any Error in the Faith, or depravation in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. For in ſuppoſing that confeſſion, it manifeſtly appears, that that time was a time of the increaſe of the Church, ſince it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deny'd, that the Church does not then encreaſe, when the true Doctrine is ſpread abroad in all places, from whence would follow, that the Society that taught that true Doctrine through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, was the true Church, rather than a ſmall party that were ſhut up within one only Province. So that the Error of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> conſiſted in this, in that they would have reſtrain'd the Church in their <hi>Africa</hi> in a time wherein it manifeſtly increaſed in all Nations; and this increaſe was manifeſt, by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement which they themſelves made, that the Society that was ſpread over all the world was Orthodox. This is that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would ſay: He would have S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon after this manner; in a time wherein it manifeſtly appears, that the Church encreaſes, it is an error not to acknowledge that Society that is ſpread over all the world, to be the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt, in oppoſition to a ſmall party. But in this time, it manifeſtly appears that the Church increaſes, ſince by your own confeſſion, it is the true Doctrine, and not Hereſie that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies it ſelf. Therefore it is an error not to acknowledge at this time, the Society that is ſpread over the world, to be the true Church. This is in effect, the true reaſoning of S. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is no wayes deceiv'd in it. But it clearly follows from thence, that according to S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that viſible extenſion may be ſometimes a mark of the true Church in oppoſition to a ſmall party; to wit, then when the true and pure Doctrine is ſpread abroad every where, becauſe that is the time of the increaſe of the Church: But it does not follow, that this mark is perpetual, ſince the time of that increaſe does not laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. From whence it appears, that the arguing of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> can have no place in the queſtion that is between the Church of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97749:203"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> and us. In one word, then when we conteſt the title of the true Church with a Society that does otherwiſe own us to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, then viſible extenſion decides the queſtion according to S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> But then when we conteſt that title with a Society that accuſes us with falſe Doctrine, that viſible extenſion decides no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and the difference cannot be determined, but by the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the foundation it ſelf. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alledg'd it in the former caſe, and the Author of the Prejudices alledges it in the latter.</p>
               <p>What need we to do more to ſet down this truth in its full evidence, and to give the Author of the Prejudices entire ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? Do we need to let him ſee that if they had accuſed the Society of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of falſe Doctrine, that Father had not pretended in this caſe, that that viſible extenſion ſhould have decided the conteſt, but that he would have decided it at the foundation? Need we to go yet farther, and to ſhew him that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has formally acknowledg'd, that there have been in effect, times wherein the true Church has had no viſible extenſion? If we could ſhew him theſe two things, he would methinks have ſome reaſon to be contented, and to leave us in peace about this buſineſs of extenſion. Let us therefore endeavour to ſatisfie him about theſe two Articles. The firſt will be decided, if we here appeal to what I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of that Father on the occaſion of what <hi>Creſconius</hi> had ſaid to him, that he ought to withdraw himſelf from the Church of the <hi>Traditors. Is it,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that the Traditors have compoſed Books, to ſhew, that we ought to do, or imitate their action? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have recommended thoſe Books to poſterity?</hi> Is it becauſe we hold and follow that Doctrine? If they had done that, and if they would have permitted none to remain in their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but ſuch as would read thoſe Books and approve that Doctrine; I ſay that they would have ſeparated themſelves from the Unity of the Church, and if you ſaw me in their Schiſm, you would then have reaſon to ſay, that I am in the Church of the <hi>Traditors.</hi> We need no great learning, to underſtand by this diſcourſe, 1. That S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had acknowledg'd, that if in effect his Society had determined a falſe Doctrine, if it had framed Books about it, and ſuffered no perſon its communion, who had not approved it, it had loſt the title of the True Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that viſible extenſion ſhould have been ſecured to it. 2. That if the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> who were but a ſmall party, had accuſed it, it would have admitted them to proof, without a wrangling
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97749:204"/>
with them about that extenſion. For he who ſayes, <hi>Is it becauſe we hold and follow that Doctrine?</hi> makes us ſufficiently ſee, that he would not have refuſed them liberty to come to a proof if his adverſaries had ſaid, that they held and followed it indeed. And it ought not to be ſaid, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> makes not that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition only in regard of the whole of his Society, but only in regard of ſome <hi>Traditors?</hi> For he makes that ſuppoſition in regard of that ſame Society that <hi>Creſconius</hi> had called <hi>the Church of the Traditors,</hi> and theſe words, <hi>Is it becauſe we hold and follow this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?</hi> leave no place for that evaſion.</p>
               <p>See here the firſt Article; the ſecond is yet more formal in S. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> for no one can doubt, that he has not acknowledg'd, that there have been, in effect, times wherein the true Church has ſcarce had any viſible extenſion. This is that which he has in his Letter to <hi>Heſychius,</hi> wherein he treats of the ſtate of the Church in thoſe miſerable times, which Jeſus Chriſt foretold in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug Ep.</hi> 80.</note> the four and twentieth of S. <hi>Matthew. Then the Sun,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>ſhall be darkned, and the Moon ſhall not give her light, the Stars ſhall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens ſhall be ſhaken.</hi> The Church ſhall not appear, <hi>becauſe the wicked becoming perſecutors, ſhall no more obſerve any bounds in their cruelties. Temporal Proſperity ſhall accompany them every where; ſo that ſeeing no occaſion of fear, they ſhall ſay, peace and ſecurity to themſelves. Then the Stars ſhall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens ſhall be ſhaken, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in whom grace ſeem'd to be reſplendent, ſhall yield to the perſecutors, and ſome of the moſt firm among the faithful ſhall be troubled.</hi> The Church, ſayes he, ſhall not appear, <hi>Eccleſia non apparebit.</hi> She will not therefore have then, that viſible extenſion which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Prejudices would have to be her perpetual mark for all Ages. He further acknowledges the ſame thing in his Epiſtle to <hi>Vincentius,</hi> where he treats of the ſtate of the Church under the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. Ep.</hi> 48.</note> 
                  <hi>Arians.</hi> There he teaches in expreſs terms, That the Church is ſometimes obſcured and covered with clouds, through the great number of offences, that ſhe is then only eminent in her moſt firm defenders, while the multitude of the weak and carnal is overwhelmed with the floods of temptation. That under the reign of the <hi>Arians</hi> the ſimple ſuffered themſelves to be deceiv'd, that others yielding through fear, diſſembled, and in appearance conſented to <hi>Arianiſm.</hi> That indeed ſome of the moſt firm eſcaped the ſnares of thoſe Hereticks, but that they were but few in number in compariſon of the reſt. That nevertheleſs
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97749:204"/>
ſome of them generouſly ſuffer'd baniſhment, and ſome others lay hid here and there throughout the Earth. I pray tell me, what viſible extenſion could the Orthodox communion have then, which ſubſiſted only in a ſmall number of the firm, of whom even the greateſt part had ſuffered exile, or lay hid here and there throughout all the Earth? I confeſs, that Hiſtory notes, that there were yet ſome ſmall flocks in ſome places of the Eaſt and of the Weſt, who ſet up their Aſſemblies apart as at <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> at <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and in ſome Provinces of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> but what was this in compariſon of the <hi>Arian</hi> communion, which had fill'd the Churches, and held Councils, as we have ſo often proved.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore ſeriouſly profeſs, that this viſible extenſion is a vain and deceitful mark, when they would make it perpetual to the true Church, as the Author of the Prejudices would make it, and that no one could abuſe with greater injuſtice the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> than he has done. We muſt profeſs alſo, that a ſmall handful of the Faithful, a little party, have right to ſeparate themſelves from the whole multitude; I mean, from a communion ſpread over all the world, which has on its ſide, the Miniſtry, the Pulpits, the Councils, the Schools, Titles, Dignities, and all that retinue of temporal ſplendour, when it has not the true Faith. For the reſt, that which I have handled in this Chapter about the two former Propoſitions of the Author of the Prejudices, already ſufficiently lets us ſee the falſeneſs of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. For if he would take the pains to read this Chapter with never ſo little application, he will ſee all theſe following Propoſitions well eſtabliſh'd there. 1. That in General, this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has not compris'd the true Hypotheſis of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> nor the ſtate of his diſpute againſt the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> 2. That he can draw no advantage from the divers wayes in which that Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word <hi>Church.</hi> 3. That the ſeparation which that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judg'd to be fit to be condemned and wicked, under what pretence ſoever it ſhould be made, is wholly different from that which is between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us. 4. That there is not any Chriſtian Society from which one may not lawfully ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ones ſelf, in a certain caſe and manner. 5. That that which is diſputed between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us being of this number, they muſt conſider the cauſes and circumſtances of it, rightly to judge of it, and not pretend to convince us of Schiſm, without entring upon any other diſcuſſion. 6. That according to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97749:205"/>
the principles of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Schiſmatical, in reſpect of us, ſuppoſing that ſhe is in error, becauſe it is ſhe that has broken Chriſtian Unity, and that we are in reſpect of her, in a paſſive ſeparation. 7. That it is abſurd to make that viſible extenſion, a perpetual mark of the true Church, which way ſoever they take it. 8. That this pretended mark is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the experience of our Age, and does not properly agree to any one of theſe Societies, that at this day divide Chriſtianity. 9. That it is contrary to the experience of the Ages paſt, and to the Doctrine of the Fathers. 10. That it is rejected in the ſenſe of the Author of the Prejudices, by the famous Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> communion. 11. That it has no foundation in the diſpute of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> 12. That it is even directly oppoſite to the Doctrine of that Father. Theſe are the juſt and natural conſequences that are drawn from the things which I have handled in this Chapter; I will examine in the following, the other Propoſitions of the Author of the Prejudices.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Third Propoſition of the Author of the Prejudices is already ſufficiently confuted by what I have ſaid. He ſayes, that ſince our Society is not viſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended throughout all Nations, therefore it cannot be the True Church. But we have ſhewn him, that we cannot at this day rationally attribute that viſible extenſion throughout all Nations, to any of the Societies that divide Chriſtianity, and by conſequence, that it is a chimerical mark, by which we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is no true Church in the world, ſince there is none which is not viſibly excluded from many Nations. We have ſhewn him alſo, that his pretended mark does not agree either with the experience of the Ages paſt, nor with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Fathers, nor even with that of the Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and that inſtead of having any foundation in the Doctrine of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> it is evidently contrary to him. So that we have nothing to do at preſent, but to go on to the Examination of the Fourth and Fifth Propoſition. They bear this ſenſe, <hi>That the</hi> Calviniſts <hi>urge the principle of the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>far higher, than ever thoſe Schiſmaticks did. For as for them, they did not ſay, that there was any time wherein the whole Church had fallen into Apoſtaſy, and they excepted the Communion of</hi> Donatus; <hi>whereas the</hi> Calviniſts <hi>would have it, that there have been whole Ages, wherein all the Earth had generally apoſtatized, and loſt the faith and treaſure of ſalvation. That the Societies of the</hi> Berengarians, <hi>the</hi> Waldenſes <hi>and</hi> Albigenſes, &amp;c. <hi>in which he ſayes, that ſome of us include the Church, could not be that Catholick Church whereof S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>ſpeaks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To eſtabliſh that which he layes to our Charge concerning the entire extinction of the Church, he firſt produces the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Calvin. This is,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that which</hi> Calvin <hi>has diſtinctly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prejug. ch.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 200, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>declared in his Commentary on the Epiſtle to the</hi> Romans, <hi>where after having pretended, that the threatning that S.</hi> Paul <hi>uſes againſt thoſe</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:97749:206"/>
                  <hi>who do not remain in the ſtate of grace, where the goodneſs of God had ſent the Goſpel, in declaring to them, that they ought to fear being cut off, as the Jews, from the Covenant of God, he addreſſes himſelf to the whole body of the Gentiles converted to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Ad totum Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium corpus, <hi>adds he. And certainly, that horrible Apoſtaſy of the whole world which has fallen out ſince, manifeſtly ſhews us, that this advice of S.</hi> Paul <hi>was not unprofitable. For God having diffuſed in ſo great an extenſion of Countreys, almoſt in a moment, the waters of his Grace, ſo that Religion flouriſhed every where; within a very little while after, the truth of the Goſpel was vaniſhed, and the treaſure of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion baniſhed out of the Earth. But whence could that change come, unleſs from this, that the Gentiles were fallen away from their Call, and therefore it is that he clearly profeſſes in a Letter to</hi> Melancthon, <hi>that they had ſeparated from all the world. Pluſquam enim abſurdum eſt poſtquam diſceſſionem à toto mundo facere coacti ſumus alios ab aliis deſilire.</hi> The Author of the Prejudices, yet further makes uſe of an Article of our Confeſſion of Faith to prove the ſame thing, which ſayes, <hi>That we believe, that no one ought of his own authority to thruſt himſelf into the government of the Church; but that that ought to be done by election while it is poſſible, and while God permits it. Which exception we emphatically add to it, becauſe it has failed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and even in our time, in which the ſtate of the Church was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, till God had raiſed up men after an extraordinary manner, to order the Church a new, which was in ruine and deſolation.</hi> Grounding himſelf on theſe two paſſages, he inſults over Monſieur <hi>Vigerius,</hi> the Author of the Diſcourſe in the Book of the Perpetuity of the Faith, becauſe he had declared, <hi>That none of us had ever ſaid, that it could be poſſible that the Church ſhould no longer ſubſiſt, and that he defied Monſieur</hi> Arnaud <hi>to ſhew him one only Author among us who had thought ſo. Before he had expreſſed ſuch deſires,</hi> ſayes the Author of the Prejudices, <hi>it would have been well to the purpoſe, that he had better informed himſelf about that which not only ſome Authors of his Sect have wrote, but the Maſter of all their Authors, which is</hi> Calvin, <hi>who ſayes a great deal more than that which is contained in that Book of the Perpetuity of the Faith, ſince he looks upon the Church not only as poſſible to periſh, but as having effectually done ſo for many Ages, ſo far as to ſay, that the threatning of S.</hi> Paul, <hi>which he pretends to be ſpoken to the whole body of the Gentiles, had its effect, that all the Gentiles had fell from their Call through a general Apoſtaſy, that the light of the Goſpel had vaniſhed, in reſpect of them, and that they had</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:97749:206"/>
                  <hi>loſt the treaſure of ſalvation.</hi> It is upon this foundation that he builds his Propoſition, and pretends to make us paſs for worſe men than the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all this is nothing elſe but an effect of the unjuſt and violent hatred that this Author has conceiv'd againſt us, and Monſieur <hi>Vigerius</hi> had reaſon to deny that which he has denyed. As the diſpute here is only to know, what our Hypotheſis is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 287.</note> upon the point of the perpetual ſubſiſtence of the Church, it would be ſufficient methinks to ſtop the mouth of the Author of the Prejudices, to tell him, that he troubles himſelf to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that we do not believe, that intire extinction of the Church throughout all the world, which he layes to our charge, and that he has miſtaken the meaning of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and that of our Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith; for there is no likelihood that he ſhould better know what we believe, than our ſelves, nor that he ſhould be a more faithful Interpreter of the ſenſe of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and that of our Confeſſion of Faith, than we our ſelves. Notwithſtanding, to make the Character of the Author of the Prejudices more and more known, and what judgement we ought to make of that which he propounds, when he ſpeaks with the greateſt confidence, it will be good to relate here the teſtimony that Monſieur the Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> has given to the Proteſtant Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that that they believe and teach upon the ſubject of the perpetual ſubſiſtence of the Church until the end of the world. For we might ſay, that he had the Author of the Prejudices in his view, and wrote about this matter only to confute him. <hi>There is not,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>any point in controverſie between our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>and us, about which their Confeſſions of Faith ſpeak ſo clearly, and agree ſo uniformly as this, which I may truly ſay ought not to be put into the number of the controverted points. The Confeſſion of</hi> Ausburg, <hi>which may be ſaid to be as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well the Rule, as the ſource and origine of all the other Confeſſions of Faith of our Adverſaries, ſayes in expreſs terms, that the Church ought perpetually to remain, one and holy. That of</hi> Saxony <hi>ſayes, that the Article of the Creed which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the Church Holy and Catholick, was inſerted therein, only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the faithful againſt the doubts that they might have of the ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church. That of the</hi> Switzers, <hi>does not only affirm this truth, but ſets down the ſame reaſon for it that I my ſelf have made uſe of here above, ſince God, ſayes it, would from all eternity that men ſhould be ſaved, we muſt acknowledge this truth, that the Church</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:97749:207"/>
                  <hi>has alwayes been for the time paſt, that ſhe ſubſiſts for the preſent, and that ſhe will do ſo till the end of the world. The</hi> Scotch <hi>holds this Article to be ſo undoubtedly true, that it compares the belief of it to that of the Myſterie of the Trinity, ſaying, That as the faithful believe the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, ſo they alſo conſtantly believe the perpetuity of the Church. The</hi> Flemiſh <hi>profeſſes the ſame truth, and gives the reaſon, altogether founded upon the Regality of Jeſus Chriſt, which being perpetual, ſuppoſes in all times ſome ſubjects, over whom he muſt reign. The</hi> French <hi>Confeſſion alone ſayes nothing upon this occaſion; but it is ſo far from ſaying nothing of it, through the difficulty that they found in this point, that on the contrary, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty which they had of it, was, in my opinion the cauſe of their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. She does not therefore, it may be, ſpeak any thing, becauſe ſhe did not think ſhe could doubt of ſo evident a truth, of which her founders have ſpoke ſo clearly for her.</hi> Luther <hi>teaches it in terms ſo expreſs, that he makes perpetuity to enter into the definition of the Church, as a quality that making a part of its eſſence, is altogether inſeparable from it. He draws the duration of the Church from an Article of the Creed and the words of Jeſus Chriſt, which bind us to believe it, ſaying that it is an Article of Faith taught in the Creed, and founded upon the promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt, who ought alwayes to have a holy Chriſtian Society in this world, that ſhould ſubſiſt until the conſummation of Ages.</hi> Calvin <hi>does not ſay leſs, and his words are not leſs expreſs. We muſt, ſayes he, hold it for certain, that from the beginning of the world, there never was a time wherein the Church of God was not, and there never will be, till the conſummation of Ages, in which it ſhall not be. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this foundation refuting</hi> Servetus, <hi>who maintained, that the Church had been baniſhed from the world for a certain time, he ſayes boldly, that to ſay, that God had not alwayes preſerved ſome Church in this world, would be to accuſe him of a lye, becauſe he has promiſed, that it ſhall endure as long as the Sun and Moon ſhall.</hi> Beza <hi>ſpeaks as the</hi> Flemiſh <hi>Confeſſion, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that the reign of Jeſus Chriſt is perpetual, acknowledges alſo, that he ought alwayes to have ſubjects, upon whom to exerciſe that Kingly Office.</hi> Du Moulin <hi>and</hi> Meſtreſat, <hi>are not leſs ingenuous in this point,</hi> &amp;c. Thus it is that Monſieur the Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi> has juſtified us againſt the Author of the Prejudices. He could not, in my judgement, have ſpoken either more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or more ſtrongly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:97749:207"/>
In effect, they cannot without ignorance or calumny, aſcribe that opinion of the intire extinction of the Church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the world to us. We ſay indeed, and we ſay it with an extream grief, that the Church has been for ſome Ages in ſo great an obſcurity, that we can very hardly ſee any traces of the natural beauty of Chriſtianity ſhine forth there, Ignorance, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, Superſtition, as moſt thick Clouds have covered the face of Religion and the Government of the Church has fallen into ſo ſtrange a diſorder, that we can ſee nothing but confuſion in all parts; ſo that the Church could not but appear under a very deplorable condition under that Eclipſe. This is that which <hi>Calvin</hi> means, by that intire defection of the world, whereof he ſpeaks in the paſſage that the Author of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices has alledged, and that which is alſo repreſented in our Confeſſion of Faith, by that ruine and deſolation, whereinto we ſay the Church was fallen. But how great ſoever that ruine ſhould have been, we do not believe as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> do, that the Church had abſolutely periſhed, or that it was intirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct through all the world. We do not ſo much as believe that it was reſtrained to thoſe Societies which the paſſion of their enemies has laboured to cry down under the names of Sects, calling them <hi>Berengarians, Waldenſes, Albigenſes, Petro-bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Henricians, Wicklefiſts, Huſſites,</hi> &amp;c. and over whom the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Prejudices has inſulted ſo fiercely after his uſual manner. Thoſe Societies were yet the moſt illuſtrious part of the Church, becauſe they were the moſt pure, the moſt enlightned and the moſt generous; but the Church did not wholly and entirely reſide in them. For, not to ſpeak of the little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that dyed before the Age of diſcretion, and to whom we do not doubt that God was merciful, we are perſwaded that while Errors and Superſtitions might be ſeen to reign in their Pulpits, in their Books, in their Schools, and in the Councils, and that a great number were filled with them, that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to himſelf amidſt the people a conſiderable number of the truly faithful, who have kept their faith and their conſcience pure, by reaſon of their ſimplicity, contenting themſelves with the principles of the Chriſtian Religion, adoring one only God, their Creator and Father, putting their confidence in one only Jeſus Chriſt, dead and riſen again for them: and as to the reſt, living holily and Chriſtianly with embaraſſing themſelves either
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97749:208"/>
with the opinions of the School, which they did not know, or the Superſtitions wherewith they beheld Chriſtianity loaded, and which the ſole inſtinct of their conſcience could make them reject. We no wayes doubt, that even among the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned perſons, there has been a great number who have groaned under ſo many corruptions as they ſaw the Church afflicted with, and who in waiting for better times, have kept themſelves, without bearing a part in them. But we ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon this ſubject, but what the Fathers, and in particular S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> have ſaid concerning the ſtate of the Church under the domination of the <hi>Arians.</hi> For they have ſaid two moſt remarkable things. Firſt, That while the wicked and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks poſſeſſed the Pulpits, while they preached their blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies there, whilſt they were Maſters of the Councils, whilſt they had the multitude and the powers of the Age on their ſide, while they perſecuted the good to the utmoſt, and while all ſeemed to ſtoop under their yoak, God preſerved in that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Miniſtry, a conſiderable number of the truly faithful, who kept under the veil of their ſimplicity, their faith pure, receiving that which they preached of good to them, and not being infected with the bad. The ſecond thing that they have ſaid is, that there were thoſe there, who being more enlightned and more ſtrong in the faith than the others, oppoſed themſelves to the Hereſie of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and would not have any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, ſuffering conſtantly their baniſhments, and the moſt cruel puniſhments for ſo juſt a cauſe. To juſtifie this truth, I ſhall only here ſet down that which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has wrote upon this ſubject in his Epiſtle to <hi>Vincentius:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I relate his words, we muſt note, that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely did that which the Author of the Prejudices has done, when he has abuſed ſome hyperbolical expreſſions that <hi>Calvin</hi> made uſe of, and the words of our Confeſſion of Faith, to lay it to our charge, that we believe an entire extinction of the Church. For the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> after the ſame manner abuſed ſome paſſages of S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> in which that Saint had exaggerated the lamentable ſtate of the Church in his dayes, under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the <hi>Arians;</hi> from whence they conclude, that S. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> had thought that the Church had entirely failed. It is therefore to refute this Objection that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> explains <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. Ep.</hi> 48.</note> himſelf after this manner. <hi>The Church,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>is ſometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97749:208"/>
and covered as it were with clouds, by the great number of</hi>

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 290.</note> 
                  <hi>ſcandals, when the wicked take the advantage of the night to ſhoot againſt thoſe who are true in heart. But even then, ſhe is eminent in her moſt firm defenders: and if it be allowed to us to make ſome diſtinction in the words that God ſpake to</hi> Abraham, <hi>Thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſhall be as the Stars of Heaven, and as the Sand that lyes upon the Sea-ſhore. I mean, that we muſt underſtand by the Stars, ſome few perſons more firm and illuſtrious than the others; and by the Sand, the multitude of the weak and carnal, which in a time of a calm appears quiet and free; but which is ſometimes covered with the floods of tribulations and temptations. Such was the time whereof</hi> Hilary <hi>ſpeaks in his Writings, which you artificially make uſe of to elude ſo many Divine Teſtimonies which I have ſet before you, as if the Church had periſhed throughout all the world. You may as well ſay, that there were no more Churches in</hi> Galatia, <hi>when the Apoſtle ſaid, O fooliſh</hi> Galatians! <hi>who hath bewitched you, that after having begun in the Spirit, you ſhould end in the fleſh! for thus it is well nigh that you calumniate the learned</hi> Hilary, <hi>under a pretence that he cenſured the negligent and the fearful, for whom he has as it were ſo many birth-pangs till Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be formed in them. Who is there that knows not that in the time of</hi> Arianiſm, <hi>divers ſimple perſons, deceived by obſcure expreſſions, imagined, that the</hi> Arians <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd the ſame thing with themſelves; that others yielded through fear and diſſimulation, and conſented in appearance to hereſie, not walking in integrity in the way of the truth of the Goſpel, you would ſee, you</hi> Donatiſts, <hi>that he had not pardoned thoſe perſons: for you are not ignorant of the doctrine of the Scripture upon this ſubject. Read what S.</hi> Paul <hi>has wrote concerning S.</hi> Peter: <hi>See afterwards, what S.</hi> Cyprian <hi>has thought was to be done on theſe occaſions, and you will find, that it is to very ill purpoſe to blame the mildneſs of the Church, which gathers together the members of Ieſus Chriſt, when they are diſperſed, inſtead of diſperſing them when they are gathered together. Howſoever it be, there have been yet ſome firm ones, who were ſufficiently enlightned to know the ſnares of the Hereticks. They were indeed very few in number, in compariſon of others; but yet nevertheleſs, ſome of them generouſly ſuffered baniſhment for the cauſe of the faith, and others kept themſelves concealed here and there throughout the earth. Thus it was that the Church, which increaſed in all Nations, preſerved within her ſelf the good Wheat of our Lord, and thus it is that ſhe will preſerve her ſelf unto the end, till ſhe</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:97749:209"/>
                  <hi>extend her ſelf over all people, and even over the Barbarians themſelves. The Church therefore conſiſts in the good ſeed that the Son of Man has ſown, and of which it is ſaid, that it ſhould grow up, until the harveſt, amidſt the Tares. The field is the world, and the harveſt is the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See here, after what manner S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> declares his opinion concerning the ſtate of the Church and its ſubſiſtence under the <hi>Arians;</hi> ſince coming afterwards to ſpeak of a paſſage of S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> which they had objected to him, he ſayes, that we muſt underſtand that which he had ſaid, not in regard of the good Wheat which was yet mingled with the Tares; but only in regard of the Tares: or if his words had any relation to the good Wheat, we muſt take them as only deſigning to enflame the zeal of the fearful by ſuch anſwers. And he adds that the holy Scripture it ſelf frequently makes uſe of this way of expreſſing it ſelf in general terms, which at firſt ſeem to belong to the whole body; but which notwithſtanding regard only a part. <hi>Habent etiam ſcripturae canonicae, hunc arguendi mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, ut tanquam omnibus dicatur, &amp; ad quoſdam verbum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may now ſee very clearly, that we are ſo far from being like to the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> as the Author of the Prejudices layes it to our charge, that we tread on the contrary, in the footſteps of St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> For firſt of all, our Hypotheſis touching the ſubſiſtence and obſcurity of the Church, is throughout conform to his. We ſay, as he does, that God has alwayes preſerved his truly faithful in the very communion of the corrupted Church. We ſay, with him, that in the moſt violent entring in of Error and Superſtition, God has not left himſelf without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſince he has raiſed up, not only perſons, but whole Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, that have openly and couragiouſly maintained the truth, and withdrawn themſelves from under the <hi>Roman</hi> Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as to the paſſages that the Author of the Prejudices objects to us out of <hi>Calvin</hi> and our Confeſſion of Faith, we give the ſame explication of it that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gave to thoſe of S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> which the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> objected to him: That is to ſay, that that defection of all the world, and that ruine and deſolation whereinto the Church had fell, that Eclipſe of the truth and treaſure of ſalvation, are expreſſions that regard pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly only the Tares that covered the Field of the Church,

and not the good Seed which was mingled with thoſe Tares. Theſe expreſſions only regard the greater number of thoſe who followed thoſe Superſtitions and Errors, and not thoſe who in the midſt of that confuſion kept their Religion pure; and much leſs thoſe who had the courage to oppoſe themſelves openly to Error, and to reſiſt it even unto Perſecutions and Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>I know that he has accuſtomed himſelf to form ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Objections againſt our Hypotheſis; but we have this ſatisfaction, to know, that he can make none that does not equally regard the Hypotheſis of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and ours, and to which, by conſequence, the Author of the Prejudices himſelf would not be obliged to anſwer, if he would not act the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſt.</hi> He confeſſes himſelf, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that there might have been ſome Catholicks hid in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical communions; and beſides, he cannot deny, that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which I have ſet down, is expreſs upon that ſubject. 1. If therefore he demands of us, who thoſe faithful were, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation, kept their faith pure, without infecting themſelves with the publick errors; and if he urges us to mark them out to him one after another, to tell him their names and their Genealogy, I will demand of him likewiſe, who were thoſe <hi>good ſeed</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who under the <hi>Arian</hi> Miniſtry, preſerved their faith, without being infected with Hereſie; and I will intreat him to mark them out to me by name, and to give me their hiſtory. 2. If he demands of us, how we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe perſons could with a good conſcience live under a Miniſtry, where they taught Tranſubſtantiation, the Adoration of the Euchariſt, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images, which we believe to be fundamental er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; I will alſo demand of him, how he underſtands, that the <hi>good ſeed</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> could live under an <hi>Arian</hi> Miniſtry, where they taught, that the Son of God was not conſubſtantial with his Father; and that the Father was not the Father eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; which are errors that the Author of the Prejudices him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf judges abominable. 3. If he tells us, that our Fathers ought not therefore to have undertaken a Reformation; but that they ought to have left things in the eſtate wherein they were;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97749:210"/>
ſince howſoever corrupted the <hi>Latin</hi> Church was, according to us, we could yet be ſaved in her communion: I ſhall tell him, that by the ſame reaſon, the Orthodox ought not to have taken care to have re-eſtabliſhed the purity of the faith in the Church, nor to have extirpated <hi>Arianiſm;</hi> ſince that however corrupted and infected the Church was with that Hereſie, there was yet a way to work out their ſalvation in her communion, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Miniſtry. 4. If he ſayes to us, that our Fathers ought not at leaſt in reforming themſelves, to have ſeparated themſelves from thoſe who were not for a Reformation; nor to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook their communion and aſſemblies, I will alſo ſay to him, that after this reckoning, the Orthodox in labouring to purge the Church from <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> ought not at leaſt to have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated it ſelf from thoſe who would retain <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> but that they ought to have remained with them in one and the ſame communion, and in the ſame aſſemblies, which nevertheleſs they did not. 5. If he ſayes to us, that the <hi>Berengarians,</hi> the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were Schiſmaticks, ſince they had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn themſelves from a communion, and a Miniſtry under which God yet preſerves the truly faithful, I will likewiſe ſay to him, that thoſe couragious men of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> were in this reckoning Schiſmaticks, ſince they had not leſs withdrawn themſelves from that communion and publick Miniſtry, when that Miniſtry was in the hands of the <hi>Arians,</hi> as I have ſhewn by expreſs teſtimonies. 6. If he tells us, laſtly, that ſince we acknowledge, that they could have worked out their ſalvation under the Miniſtry of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ought to confeſs, that we may yet at this day be ſaved in it, ſince things are in the ſame eſtate now, in which they were before; I ſhall tell him, that the <hi>Arians</hi> could have raiſed the ſame objection againſt the Orthodox after their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For the <hi>Arians</hi> did not pretend to have changed any thing in the ſtate of the Miniſtry under which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that God had preſerved the truly faithful. So that all the Objections which he ſhall make againſt our Hypotheſis, will be common to thoſe againſt that of S. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> and the Author of the Prejudices will himſelf be as much concerned as we to anſwer them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:97749:210"/>
But not to refer our ſelves wholly to him, let us ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe difficulties are of ſuch a weight, as that there is no way left rationally to ſatisfie us. It ſeems to me therefore, that as to the firſt, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has ſaid, that it is great injuſtice to demand the names of thoſe particular men, who kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pure under an impure Miniſtry, ſince we do not keep a regiſter of every particular man, nor of the ſtate of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; and that it is ſufficient to know in the general, that the promiſes that Jeſus Chriſt has made, alwayes to preſerve to himſelf a Church upon Earth, are inviolable, that we muſt not therefore doubt, that there has alwayes been good ſeed in the midſt of the <hi>Arian</hi> tares. It is the ſame anſwer that we make, there needs nothing but to apply it.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, he has anſwered, that the ſimplicity of many among the people, who went not ſo far as to underſtand the bad ſenſe of the <hi>Arian</hi> expreſſions, ſheltred them under Hereſie; that many others of the more enlightned remained in ſilence, through the fear of perſecutions, contenting themſelves to keep their own faith pure, without partaking in the wickedneſs of the wicked, and without liſting themſelves up againſt it. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is a Maxim of <hi>Phoebadius, That it is ſufficient to an humble</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phoebad. contr. Arian. Aug. paſſim.</note> 
                  <hi>conſcience, to keep its own faith, without engaging it ſelf to refute the belief of others:</hi> and it is one of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf, That no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can be culpable for the ſins of another, nor by conſequence, for the Hereſies and Superſtitions that infect a Miniſtry; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he take no part in them, and no wayes conſent to them, either in effect or appearance. But this is yet the ſame anſwer that we make: for as I have already ſaid, we do not doubt, that there was among the people a very great number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe light went no further than the meer knowing of the chief Articles of Chriſtianity, contained in the <hi>Creed,</hi> in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue</hi> and <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and who by conſequence were hid under thoſe capital Errors with which the publick Miniſtry was then loaded. We no wayes doubt, that in the midſt of that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there were not a great many enlightned perſons, who through the fear of perſecutions, remained under the ſame corrupted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, with the others, ſeparating the good from the bad, diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97749:211"/>
the Errors and Superſtitions, taking no part in them, and living as to other things, in that hope that they ſhould not be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable for the ſins of others.</p>
               <p>To the third, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has anſwered, that it is an abſurd Objection. For it is not more abſurd to ſay, that we ought not to take care to heal a Diſeaſe, under a pretence that as great as the Diſeaſe is, life yet remains, than to ſay, that we ought not to take care to purge the Church and the Miniſtry from a Hereſie that infects it, under a pretence, that there is yet a way to be ſaved in her communion and under her Miniſtry. That we muſt, on the contrary, labour as much as poſſibly we can, to re-eſtabliſh Chriſtianity in its whole frame, leſt the evil ſhould increaſe, and be made incurable through a too great negligence, and leaſt that good which remains in the Church, ſhould be wholly corrupted by the contagion of the evil. But this is alſo the very ſame anſwer that we make. Our Fathers ought to have employed all their endeavours to reform the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, by their Exhortations, by their Books, by their Sermons, by their Example, becauſe that we ought alwayes as much as poſſibly we can, and as the time and our knowledge call us to it, to labour to ſettle Religion in a ſtate of purity, leſt in the end Errors and Superſtitions render themſelves univerſal, and the whole Church ſhould periſh through our negligence. For although Jeſus Chriſt has promiſed us, that it ſhall never periſh, yet notwithſtanding this would be to tempt God, and to render our ſelves unworthy of his grace, to neglect the means that he gives us for its preſervation, and that ſo much the more, as according to humane judgements, there was no other than that of the Reformation.</p>
               <p>To the fourth, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has anſwered, That in labouring to purge the Church from <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> it was neceſſary that they ſhould ſeparate themſelves from the communion of thoſe who obſtinately perſiſted in that Hereſie; and the fixed reſolution that they teſtified to remain in it, was a ſufficient cauſe to make them withdraw themſelves from their Aſſemblies. But we anſwer with greater advantage, that our Fathers in labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for a Reformation, ought to have forſaken the Aſſemblies
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97749:211"/>
of thoſe, who not only were fixed in the opinion of having nothing reformed, and oppoſed themſelves with all their might to hinder a Reformation; but who went ſo far as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a new neceſſity on mens conſciences to believe their Opinions, and even to excommunicate all thoſe who would not believe them.</p>
               <p>As to the fifth, S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> did not intend to ſay, that thoſe who had ſeparated themſelves from the <hi>Arians,</hi> when the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were the Maſters of the Miniſtry, were Schiſmaticks, ſince he himſelf calls them the Stars of Heaven, the Couragious and Unſhaken, <hi>firmiſſimi qui fortiter pro fide exulabant:</hi> he never meant to condemn their Aſſemblies which they made apart, to have nothing common with Hereſie, ſince it was nothing elſe but the effect of that heroical courage which he aſcribes to them, and of that ardent zeal which they had for the glory of God. In effect, S. <hi>Hilary</hi> praiſes ſome Biſhops of <hi>France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> of whom he writes that they had ſeparated themſelves from the communion of thoſe who held the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Biſhops in Exile; and in particular, he extolls thoſe among them, who having appealed to a Synod of <hi>Bithynia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained firm and conſtant in the faith, and in gathering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a communion among themſelves, they ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the communion of the others. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has therefore anſwered, that they were no wayes Schiſmaticks, for two reaſons. The firſt is, becauſe the cauſes for which they refuſed communion with the <hi>Arians,</hi> and withdrew themſelves from their Miniſtry were juſt and lawful; not frivolous and capricious, as thoſe of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> but weighty and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; ſince they diſputed about the Eternal Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, which the <hi>Arians</hi> would aboliſh. The ſecond, becauſe that although theſe couragious men of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the communion of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and withdrawn themſelves from their Miniſtry, yet they did not believe notwithſtanding, that there was abſolutely no more ſalvation to be had in the Society which they had forſaken. For, beſides that receiving as they did, their Baptiſm from it, they could not doubt, that the Children who dyed before they were infected with that Hereſie, were ſaved, they did not alſo condemn the ſimple and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97749:212"/>
the weak, who remained unfeignedly in that communion, without taking part in the impieties which were taught there, ſo that their ſeparation did not abſolutely reſpect that Society; but only the Hereticks that corrupted it. But this is that which we ſay concerning the <hi>Berengarians,</hi> the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,</hi> the <hi>Albigenſes, &amp;c.</hi> we need but only to apply the ſame anſwer to them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as to that which regards the ſixth Objection, S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> has ſaid, that there was a conſiderable difference between the time wherein the <hi>Arians</hi> made up almoſt the whole body of the Chriſtian Church, and that wherein the true Doctrine was re-eſtabliſhed in a great part of the Churches; that the firſt was a time of oppreſſion, and the other a time of liberty; that in the former time there being ſcarce any more a viſible communion on the Earth, under which the faithful might place themſelves, they could remain under a corrupted Miniſtry, from which each one in particular had a right to ſeparate the pure from the impure, in waiting till God ſhould deliver his Church out of the hands of thoſe bad Paſtors. But in the ſecond time, where the Orthodox and <hi>Arian</hi> communions were in a viſible oppoſition, and ſuch as was every where known, it was not poſſible for them to remain under the <hi>Arian</hi> Miniſtry, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having an <hi>Arian</hi> heart; or at leaſt, without falling into a deteſtable hypocriſie. For in the oppoſition of theſe two communions, this very thing that they ſhould remain in the <hi>Arian,</hi> was a manifeſt condemnation of the Orthodox; which they could not do, without being either <hi>Arians,</hi> or hypocrites. Moreover, in the former time thoſe who remained out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity under the Miniſtry of the <hi>Arians,</hi> remained there in grief, and ardently deſiring that God would procure them ſome means to get out of it, and to return to an Orthodox Miniſtry. But in the latter, God having given them the power to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a pure communion, they could not remain in the <hi>Arian,</hi> without loving and being pleaſed with it, through thoſe worldly intereſts which they could never prefer before the Confeſſion of a pure faith, without being injurious to God, without wounding their own conſciences, without having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched and profane ſpirit; and in a word, without binding over
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97749:212"/>
themſelves to eternal damnation. Behold here, what S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> has anſwered; and it is no hard matter to judge, that we muſt anſwer them thus when they make the like Objections to us. We muſt diſtinguiſh between two Times, to wit, that which went before the Reformation, and that which followed it; and by the ſame reaſons which I have alledged, we will ſhew them, that although it was poſſible in the former time for ſome to work out their own ſalvation under the corrupted Miniſtry of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, yet it does not follow, that we may do ſo at this day, under that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince thoſe two communions are now found to be ſet in oppoſition.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not urge this matter further. We may now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, conclude from all that which I have handled in the foregoing Chapter and in this, that if there ever was a vain and ill-grounded Objection, that which the Author of the Prejudices has made againſt us, is certainly one of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. His Argument is founded upon nothing elſe but falſe or ill-underſtood Propoſitions. For it is not true, that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> believed that there was any particular Society among all thoſe which make a profeſſion of Chriſtianity, from whoſe Aſſemblies one might not, in certain caſes, depart and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw ones ſelf from its communion. It is not true, that the Separation which is between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us, is that which that Father has abſolutely condemned, and for which he accuſes the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> to be Schiſmaticks. It is not true, that he would accuſe them of Schiſm without examining the foundation, by a meer paſſive Separation, as that is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are, from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is not true, that he has taken that viſible extenſion throughout all Nations, for a perpetual mark of the true Church. It is not true, that he would have that mark to decide the queſtion of the true Church, when the Doctrine of it is diſputed. It is not true, that we hold, that the Church before the Reformation, had periſhed throughout all the Earth. It is not true, that we reduce all to the <hi>Berengarians, Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes, &amp;c.</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Laſtly, It is not true, that the Doctrine of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon this ſubject, is any way contrary to us; but it is true,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97749:213"/>
that our Principles have all the conformity with his that any man can reaſonably require. This is in my judgement, that which may be clearly collected from that which I have ſaid.</p>
               <p>As the Intereſt that we have in the clearing of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, does not go much farther, I would here put an end to this Chapter and this Third Part, concerning our Separation, if the intereſt of Truth and Charity did not bind me to make a reflection upon a Propoſition that the Author of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices has ſet before us, which is, that Schiſmaticks are out of a ſtate of Salvation. For I hold, that this Propoſition cannot be maintain'd after the manner that the Author of the Prejudices has propounded it, that is to ſay, abſolutely, and without any diſtinction. I am not ignorant that to eſtabliſh this rigorous ſentiment, they produce ſome paſſages of the Fathers, who have in effect ſpoke of Schiſm in extreamly vehement terms, as if they had a deſign to exclude from the communion of God, and all hopes of ſalvation, all thoſe in general who ſhould be found engaged in it. But that very thing, ought to be an example to let us ſee, that we muſt not alwayes take according to the rigour of the Letter, all that the Fathers have ſaid in the heat of their diſputes. For unleſs we ſhould be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, we muſt place a difference between three ſorts of perſons who are to be found in a Schiſmatical communion. 1. The Authors of Schiſm, who uſually are the Paſtors and Guides of the flock. 2. Underſtanding perſons, who take part in the affairs, and who very well knowing what they do, give their conſent to Schiſm, and defend the Authors of it. 3. The people, that is to ſay, the ignorant perſons who ſcarce know any thing that paſſes, or who know but very confuſedly. And for that which regards the Authors and other intelligent perſons, as it is moſt frequently, paſſion, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, pride and ambition, that make them ſeparate, and that all thoſe paſſions turn them in the end, into an implacable hatred againſt their brethren, they deſerve our condemnation; for thoſe crimes are incompatible with the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; and it is a manifeſt demonſtration, that the world and its corruption reigns in the ſouls of thoſe who are guilty of it;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97749:213"/>
we muſt therefore ſay of ſuch Schiſmaticks as theſe, that while they remain in this condition, there is no hope of ſalvation for them, becauſe that the true faith, the Covenant of God, and the communion of Jeſus Chriſt cannot ſubſiſt under the reign of thoſe brutal paſſions. But to imagine, that the whole body of a people, who are to be found engaged in a Schiſm, either through the faction of the more powerful, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience prepoſſeſs'd by a zeal without knowledge, by a Piety too ſcrupulous, ſhould be depriv'd of all hope of ſalvation; this would be without doubt to fall into a very rigid Opinion.</p>
               <p>To make this clear by Examples, I have already mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned elſewhere, that <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> excommunicated the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> upon the difference about the day of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> from whence there followed a Schiſm between thoſe Churches and this of <hi>Rome.</hi> I do not now enquire to which of the two parties the crime of the Separation, ought to be imputed, either to the <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> who adhered too ſtrictly to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of their Anceſtors and the Authority of <hi>Polycarp;</hi> or to <hi>Victor,</hi> who without Prudence and Charity, ſeparated him from divers great and flouriſhing Churches, about a matter that was left ſelf-free and indifferent in Religion. I only ſay, that this would be an horrible injuſtice, to condemn thoſe people to eternal flames, who ſhould be found to be engaged in that ridiculous quarrel, only through the capricious humours of their Biſhops. In effect, we have ſeen, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Schiſm, they did not fail both the one and the other to ſit together in the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt paſs the ſame judgement of a Schiſm that fell <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Socrat. Hiſt. Eccleſ. l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 34.</note> out in the fourth Century, at <hi>Antioch,</hi> between the <hi>Meletians</hi> and the <hi>Euſtatians,</hi> both the one and the other Orthodox and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the <hi>Arrians,</hi> but who nevertheleſs would not communicate together, becauſe that although <hi>Meletius</hi> had preached and defended the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and ſuffered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for it, yet he had been created Biſhop by the <hi>Arians,</hi> by reaſon of which, the other Orthodox would no more commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with thoſe of his party, which obliged them to hold
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97749:214"/>
their Aſſemblies apart. It was therefore a true Schiſm on one ſide and on the other; but as it proceeded only from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of zeal on the ſide of the <hi>Euſtatians,</hi> we ought not to paſs a ſentence of damnation ſo lightly againſt them.</p>
               <p>I ſay the ſame thing of the Schiſm that fell out about the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baron. ad ann.</hi> 484.</note> end of the Fifth Century, between <hi>Acatius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> the Third Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who mutually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated one another, for the intereſts of <hi>John Talaia</hi> and <hi>Peter Mongus</hi> competitors for the Patriarchate of <hi>Alexandria. Acacius</hi> defended the ſide of <hi>Peter,</hi> whom <hi>Felix</hi> accuſed to be a Heretick, and an enemy to the Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> and <hi>Felix,</hi> on the contrary, upheld <hi>Talaia,</hi> whom <hi>Acacius</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Perjury, and to be unworthy of a Biſhoprick; and this Schiſm alſo laſted down to their Succeſſors, thirty and five years between the Eaſt and Weſt. But although <hi>Acacius,</hi> drawn in by intrigues to the ſide of an hypocrite, had wrong at the foundation, yet we ought not notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to believe that all thoſe great Churches who kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, and defended his memory, after his death, were abſolutely cut off from the hope of Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>In the Sixth Century, there was another Schiſm, whereof I have already ſpoken, which was very contentious, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled, <note place="margin">Baron. in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil.</note> under the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian, Vigilius</hi> being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Mennas</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The ground of the quarrell, was taken from the Writings that had been approved in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and which afterwards were condemned as heretical by the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and the condemnation was ſubſcribed by <hi>Mennas</hi> and the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and their Biſhops, <hi>Vigilius</hi> who was of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, undertook the defence of thoſe Writings, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated <hi>Mennas</hi> and the reſt who had condemned them. But ſome Months after, he took off his Excommunication, at the ſolicitation of the Empreſs <hi>Theodora,</hi> to whom he owed his Biſhoprick; and which was more, in the following year, he himſelf pronounced an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt thoſe three Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. But the Biſhops of <hi>Africa, Illyria</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia</hi> perſiſted to defend them; and thoſe in <hi>Africa</hi> aſſembled in Council, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97749:214"/>
                  <hi>Vigilius,</hi> as a diſſembler. Some time after <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Victor. Tunun. in Chron.</note> repenting himſelf of that which he had done, undertook a ſecond time the defence of thoſe Writings. <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> on the contrary, made an Edict, by which he renewed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; and <hi>Vigilius,</hi> on his ſide, excommunicated all thoſe who ſhould conſent to this Edict. In fine, the Fifth General Council aſſembled at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where in ſpight of all the Decrees of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the three Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were condemned, and all thoſe who ſhould approve them were excommunicated. <hi>Vigilius</hi> perſiſting in his opinion was baniſhed, and dyed ſome years after.

               <p>See here already ſome inconveniencies conſiderable enough, that flow from that rigorous ſentiment; but if we would go yet further, we may find it may be others that are not leſs ſevere. For what will they ſay to the Schiſms that fell out ſo frequently in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church through the concurrence of Anti-Popes? Will they dare roundly to pronounce, all thoſe people who have lived and dyed, under the obedience of thoſe falſe Popes, and who by conſequence having been engaged in a true Schiſm, have been totally cut off from the Chriſtian Communion, and deprived of ſalvation? Let the Author of the Prejudices, who has taken ſuch pains to damn the World without any mercy, take the pains if he pleaſes to examine one matter of fact, that I will ſet before him, and which ſhould be enough, methinks, to decide this Queſtion, at leaſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of him. It is this, that during the great Schiſm of two Anti-Popes, which was ended at the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> there were Saints that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has canonized, and whom it prayes to, who lived and dyed under two contrary obediences, and who by conſequence dyed, both the one ſort and the others, in a true Schiſm. For in the year 1380. <note place="margin">Vide Raynald. ad ann. cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos.</note> S. <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Siena</hi> dyed under the obedience of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the Sixth, in the year 1381. S. <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of S. <hi>Bridget</hi> dyed under the ſame obedience. In the year 1395. S. <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Piſa</hi> dyed under the obedience of <hi>Boniface</hi> the Ninth, in the year 1399. S. <hi>Dorothy</hi> of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> dyed under the obedience of the ſame Pope; and in the year 1405. S. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Hermite of <hi>Sicily</hi> dyed under the obedience of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Seventh. On the other ſide, in the year 1382. S. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> dyed under the obedience of <hi>Clement</hi> who was the Anti-Pope of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban;</hi> and ſome time after S. <hi>Vincent</hi> of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> lived, and wrought Miracles in the party of <hi>Benoiſt</hi> the Anti-Pope of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Twelfth. Behold here Saints of both ſides, and yet one or the others muſt of neceſſity have been Schiſmaticks. From whence it appears, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf is concerned to oblige the Author of the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97749:216"/>
to moderate his ſtyle, and not to take as it ſeems he has done, that which the Fathers have ſaid in diſputing againſt the Schiſmaticks, in its utmoſt latitude.</p>
               <p>But although all that I have ſaid, ſhould have no place, the holy Scripture diſtinctly decides this difficulty. For if he would but read the Hiſtory of the Ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were ſeparated from that of <hi>Judah,</hi> at the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> he will find that they were in a real Schiſm, ſince they had forſaken the Worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and had built new Altars, againſt the expreſs commandment of God; and yet nevertheleſs that did not hinder God from preſerving his truly faithful and elect, even in the midſt of them. For there were thoſe ſeven thouſand who in the time of <hi>Elias</hi> had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> and whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the remnant of the Election of Grace, were not theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a bad party? Had not God his Prophets and his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars yet among them? <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaid <hi>Elias, they have killed thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and thrown down thy Altars.</hi> And the hundred Prophets of God that <hi>Obadiah</hi> hid in two Caves, to withdraw them from the perſecution of the Idolatreſs <hi>Jezabel:</hi> the Altar of God that <hi>Elias</hi> repaired in <hi>Carmel,</hi> to ſacrifice there by the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous fire that fell down from Heaven to conſume the victim, the calling of <hi>Eliſha</hi> and <hi>Micaiah;</hi> and in a word, the whole Hiſtory of thoſe ſchiſmatical Ten Tribes, does it not evidently note, that God looked on them as his true Church, in which there was yet a means to be ſaved? We muſt not therefore abuſe that which the Fathers have wrote againſt Schiſmaticks, in intending to aggravate their crime, and to draw them from it; nor muſt we take their expreſſions in the whole rigour of the letter. Their meaning is not, that all thoſe generally who are found engaged in a Schiſmatical Communion, even down to Tradeſmen and Labourers, who remain there with an upright heart, and through the prejudice of their conſciences, are out of the Church, and eternally damned; but that the Authors and Defenders of Schiſm, who run into it, through their perſonal intereſts, or out of a ſpirit of fierceneſs, pride, and an hatred incompatible with the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, commit a horrible crime; and that while they are in that ſtate,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97749:216"/>
they remain deprived of all hopes of ſalvation. That if the Fathers have ſaid any thing more generally, and which cannot be thus reſtrained, it is juſt to underſtand it in a comparative ſenſe; that is to ſay, that ſetting that Schiſmatical party of the Church, in oppoſition to that which is not ſo, the hope of ſalvation appears evidently in this, which it does not in the other, where it is obſcured by that Schiſm.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Order of the Matters of this Treatiſe requires, that we now go on to that Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which the Author of the Prejudices calls Poſitive; and that after having confirmed the Right that our Fathers had to Examine the State of Religion and the Church in their days, after our having ſhewed the indiſpenſable neceſſity that lay upon them to forſake the Aſſemblies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to live apart from her Communion, that we alſo eſtabliſh the Right that they had to ſet up a Chriſtian
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97749:218"/>
Society among themſelves, notwithſtanding their going off from the other Party, who were not for a Reformation; and to make up alone, and apart, a Body of the Church, or an <hi>External</hi> and viſible Communion. This is that which I pretend to eſtabliſh in this Fourth and laſt Part, and to that end I ſhall here Treat of two things: The firſt ſhall reſpect the Right of thoſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, and the Second ſhall be, concerning that of the Goſpel Miniſtry wherein our Function lies. Howſoever theſe two things have a dependance one upon another, it will yet be well to Treat of them with ſome diſtinction.</p>
               <p>To make the Firſt clear, I ſhall firſt lay it down as an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Truth, That the Right of Religious Aſſemblies natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follows that of Societies; I mean, That as far as a Religious Society is Juſt and Lawful, ſo far the Aſſemblies that are therein made are Juſt and Lawful; and that on the contrary, as far as a Society is unjuſt and wicked, ſo far its Aſſemblies are ſo too. This Principle is evident to common ſence, and it is for that Reaſon that we condemn the Aſſemblies of the <hi>Heathens, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> as Unlawful and Criminal, becauſe their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties are impious and wicked; and that having no right to be united, to believe and practice thoſe Errors which they believe and practice, they have alſo no right to Aſſemble themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in order to make a Publick Profeſſion. It is for the ſame Reaſon that we hold on the contrary, the Chriſtian Aſſemblies to be not only Juſt and Allowable, but to be neceſſary and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Divine Right, becauſe the Chriſtian Society, that is to ſay the Church, is it ſelf alſo of Divine Right. It is then True, that the Right of Aſſemblies follows that of Societies.</p>
               <p>But we muſt further ſuppoſe, as another evident and certain Truth, That our Fathers before the Reformation were <hi>Latin</hi> Chriſtians, living in the Communion of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, in which they made as conſiderable a party, as the reſt of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins;</hi> and that from Father to Son, throughout a long ſucceſſion, Time out of mind, they enjoyed with the others the rights of that Society. That they were equally in poſſeſſion of it with the other common Aſſemblies of that Religion, having a part in the Miniſtry, in the Churches, in the Sacraments, in the publick Prayers, in the Reading and Preaching of the Word; and that as far as the communion of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church was lawful, ſo far the part that our Fathers had in it was lawful alſo. That it was not a company of Strangers, or unknown perſons come from the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97749:218"/>
utmoſt parts of <hi>America</hi> or the Southern Lands, nor a ſort of People dropt down from the Clouds, who were newly joyned together with them in the ſame Society, but Perſons, and whole Families ſetled a long time ago, who were joyned together with them in the Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion many Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and who by conſequence were in poſſeſſion of the Rights of that Society. Although had they been Strangers, <hi>Americans,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> on whom God ſhould have ſuddenly beſtowed the Favour of Calling them to the True Faith and the True Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſtanity, yet we could believe that by that thing alone they would have been inveſted in all the Rights of that Society, as much as if they had had it by a long poſſeſſion, time out of mind. But howſoever it be, they were Chriſtians from Father to Son, and neither their blood nor their birth did diſtinguiſh them from the others.</p>
               <p>We are now concerned only to ſearch out whether that which hapned to our Fathers, that is to ſay their Reformation, their Condemnation by the <hi>Popes</hi> and by their Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and their Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> can be able to ſpoil them of all their Rights. For if it be True, that they were fallen off, either by their own ill Carriage, or by the meer Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we muſt yield that our Aſſemblies are Unlawful and Criminal; but if on the contrary, they were not ſo fallen off, if that which hapned to them, did nothing elſe but confirm their Right and render it more pure, more juſt and more indiſputable, they ought alſo to come to an agreement with us that our Aſſemblies are Holy and Lawful, even in a far greater degree then they were before. To begin that Diſquiſition with the Condemnation of the <hi>Popes</hi> and their Council: I confeſs, that if it were the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that out of its pure Liberality ſhould Communicate Chriſtianity to thoſe only whom it ſhould pleaſe, and that none could either have or preſerve it but by the continual influence of its Favour, after the ſame manner as we have the Day by the influence of the Sun, it would depend on her and her Councils, to take it from us whenſoever ſhe ſhould ſee good with all its Rights and Priviledges. We might very well ſay that it would be too injurious to take it away from us, that we did not deſerve ſo hard a Treatment, yet we ſhould be deprived for that very Reaſon, when ſhe ſhould have taken them from us, whether it ſhould have been with Juſtice or againſt it, with or without any reaſon. But we do not believe that either the Court

of <hi>Rome,</hi> or its Council, or that all that party who have followed them, though it ſhould have a thouſand times greater ſtrength and Authority then it has, would carry their pretenſions ſo high as to imagine that it depends on their meer good pleaſure to beſtow on, or to take away Chriſtianity and its Rights, I do not ſay from an innumerable multitude of Men, as that is which makes up the Body of the Proteſtants, but even not ſo much as from two or three perſons who ſhould be aſſembled in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> has ſaid indeed, <hi>Who art thou O man that replieſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed, ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus? Has not the Potter of the Earth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>power out of one and the ſame clay to make one Veſſel to honour, and another to diſhonour?</hi> And by theſe words he gives us to underſtand the abſolute Power that God has to make us whatſoever it ſhall ſeem good to him.</p>
               <p>But he has Taught us nothing of the like Power concerning the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Councils, he has not ſaid, Who are you that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend againſt <hi>Rome?</hi> Nor has he aſcribed to him the power to make and deſtroy us as it ſhall pleaſe him. In effect, There is none but God alone on whom our Chriſtianity depends, it is his Favour that has given it to us, his Spirit and his word have formed it in us, and his Apoſtle has Taught us to ſay with a Holy bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, That there is no Creature either in Heaven, or upon the Earth that can be able to Separate us from his Love. We ought <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> then to lay aſide that Soveraign and abſolute Authority, and to come to the cauſes or reaſons that could have been able to move the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and its Council to condemn the Proteſtants, and to deprive them of their Rights; for if thoſe cauſes are not only vain and frivolous, but unjuſt, and contrary to the Chriſtian Faith and Piety, as we maintain them to be, a Condemnation of that Nature cannot but fall back upon thoſe who have thrown it, ſince they themſelves have broken the Chriſtian Unity; ſo that their ill Carriage has made them juſtly loſe that of which they would unjuſtly deprive the others. And becauſe in thoſe kinds of Conteſts, That which one Party loſes by its injuſtice and its obſtinacy in Error, is recollected and reſtored in the other Party, which does its Duty, The Condemnation of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> being ill done as we ſuppoſe, cannot but have heightned and ſtrengthned the Rights of the Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97749:220"/>
As to the Reformation, it is not leſs True, that if that ſhould be found to be indeed Conformable to the Word of God, and the inviolable Laws of Chriſtianity, as we ſuppoſe that it is; I mean, if the Things that our Fathers rejected were indeed Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Superſtitions contrary to the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> True Faith and Piety, as we maintain them to be, ſo Holy an Action would be ſo far from depriving our Fathers of the Right of that Chriſtian Society, that on the contrary it could not but fortify that Right, and render it more lawful then it was before. For before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, That Society was, as I may ſo ſay, a Compoſition of good and evil, of Juſtice and Injuſtice, by reaſon of thoſe Errors which were mixed with the true Doctrine, and thoſe Superſtitions which were to be found in conjunction with that Religion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Reformation having freed it of that which it had of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity and droſs, has without doubt put it into a far more Holy State, and much more agreeable to God. How prejudiced ſoever they may be, they can never maintain it, That Error and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition ſhould eſtabliſh any right of Society, nor deny, that, as they are in their own nature more worthy of the Averſion of God and men, then their Approbation, they render thoſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties unlawful and criminal. For although all the World by a Univerſal Conſent ſhould be united in believing a Hereſy, or practiſing an Idolatrous Worſhip, That conſent how General ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhould be, would not change the natures of things; Hereſy would be always Hereſy, and Idolatry Idolatry, and in that reſpect the Agreement of all mankind would make up a wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Society. Whence it follows, That a mixt Communion is only lawful in proportion to that which it has of good, and that as its Juſtice is leſſened when its Corruptions increaſe, ſo its Juſtice alſo increaſes when its Corruptions are leſſened. We ought not then to imagine that the Reformation of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants has deprived them of the Right of that Chriſtian Society, but we ought to aſſert on the contrary, That it has put them in that reſpect into a far more advantageous condition then they were in before.</p>
               <p>There is nothing further remaining but that Separation, which was but by accident, as they ſpeak, the Conſequence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: if the whole Latin Church had done her Duty, ſhe would have reformed her ſelf as well as our Fathers. But the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and its Clergy would not, and that Refuſal has cauſed that breach of Communion which is fallen out between
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97749:221"/>
the two Parties. It concerns us to inquire, Whether even upon ſuppoſition that that Reformation was Juſt, and by conſequence that that Refuſal of it which they made was unjuſt, That Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration could lawfully hinder our Fathers from holding a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Society among themſelves. But this is what they cannot maintain with the leaſt colour of Reaſon. For if the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was Juſt, and if the Refuſal which they made was unjuſt, how can the injuſtice of that Party which ſhould have forgot its duty, and which would have conſtrained the other Party to have forgot it too, deprive the other Party of thoſe Rights that Faith, Holineſs, The Fear of God, and the Communion of Jeſus Chriſt, have naturally given it? Muſt Injuſtice needs Triumph over Juſtice, and Error over Truth? Is it that the Rights of that Society were ſo inſeparably joyned to thoſe who oppoſed the Reformation, that that Society could not ſubſiſt without them, and that ſeparating themſelves out of the motives of an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Prejudice, or in giving a Juſt ground to others to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves from them, they ſhould have carried away all that Society with them? This cannot be ſaid, For among all thoſe perſons who compoſe the Body of the Viſible Church, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there are none, to how high Dignities ſoever they may be raiſed, and whatſoever number of them there may be, that are ſuch Eſſential Parts, as without which the Church cannot ſubſiſt, while there are two or three remaining who may aſſemble together in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt. For Jeſus Chriſt himſelf reſtrained himſelf to that Number, <hi>When two or three of you are gathered together in my Name, I will be in the midſt of you.</hi> Jeſus <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</note> Chriſt himſelf alone, his Truth, his Goſpel, his Providence and his Spirit are eſſential to the Church, without which ſhe can never ſubſiſt, but ſhe may without the <hi>Pope,</hi> without the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> without the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> without the Biſhops, and without the people who follow <hi>Rome,</hi> and in a word, without that whole Party which refuſed the Reformation. The Chriſtian Society does not depend on their capricious humours, nor on their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Intereſts. They are not the Soul of that Body, They will be Members of it while they make profeſſion of the True Faith, or at the furtheſt while they do not oppoſe it, but when they ſhall obſtinately remain in Errors incompatible with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Jeſus Chriſt, and when they ſhall break by unjuſt <hi>Anathema</hi>'s the bond of that Society, We may very well ſay that the Body of the Viſible Church is Leſſened, but we can
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97749:221"/>
never ſay that their withdrawing leaves the Faithful under a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion.</p>
               <p>The better to underſtand this Truth, we muſt know, That although that External Society be common to the good and the bad, to the truly Faithful, to Hereticks, and the men of the World, in a word to all thoſe who are found to be externally mingled in the Body of the Church, yet in effect, the Right of that Society will not, to ſpeak properly, belong to any but the truly Faithful. For the wicked, the Hereticks and thoſe Worldly men who fill up their Aſſemblies, are only aſſociated here while they remain ſuch, in diſhonouring God, by the Contempt they have of his word, and the Indignities they offer in receiving his Sacraments. Therefore God ſaid to the wicked in <hi>Iſaiah, When you come to appear-before</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>me, who has required this at your hands to tread my Courts?</hi> And in the Fiftieth Pſalm <hi>David</hi> aſſures us, that God has ſaid to the wicked, <hi>What haſt thou to do to Read my Laws, and to take my Covenant into thy Mouth? Since thou haſt hated inſtruction, and haſt caſt my Words behind thee.</hi> It is certain then that the right of the External Society reſides in the Faithful only, who only are the Church of Jeſus Chriſt, his Myſtical body for which he dyed, the Seed which he ſowed with his own hand againſt his harveſt. As to the reſt, they are in that Communion only by Accident, and are the ſeed of <hi>Tares</hi> which the Enemy riſing at night has thrown into the Field of the Son of God, and which grows with the Wheat until the Time of the Harveſt, and it is alſo only by Accident that they are ſuffered there, to wit, becauſe moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly their wickedneſs is not known, or if it be, their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may yet be Charitably hoped for, or in fine, it may fall out that in going about to pull up the <hi>Tares,</hi> one muſt alſo pluck up the Wheat with it. But being what they are, they have not any part in the rights of that Society and of thoſe Aſſemblies. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus Chriſt has promiſed his preſence to none but ſuch as ſhall be aſſembled together in his Name, And Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">St. <hi>Auguſtine de Bapt. contra. Don.</hi> lib. 7. cap. 51.</note> expreſly Teaches that the Power of the Keys, and that of binding and looſing was given to the Church of the Juſt and true Believers, in oppoſition to the wicked, to Hereticks, and to the men of the World that are mixt with them. And it is ſaid of that Church only ſo conſidered in that ſame oppoſition, what Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid in the Goſpel, <hi>If thy Brother ſin againſt thee, tell it to the Church; and if he refuſe to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a Heathen man and a Publican.</hi> Which lets us ſee that he gave only
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97749:222"/>
the truly Faithful the Right to be in a Society, for there thoſe only have a Right to be in a Religious Society, who have the power of binding and looſing, and of hearing thoſe private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to Judge concerning them. But according to him, the truly Faithful have only that power, and it is only to thoſe that Jeſus Chriſt has given it. They are then none but thoſe, to ſpeak properly, in whom the Right of being in an External Society, and of making thoſe Aſſemblies, reſides.</p>
               <p>That being ſo laid down, who ſees not, that when it falls out that the Body of that mixed Church is divided into divers parties, about thoſe important matters that reſpect either Faith, or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or the General Rules of Manners, all the Rights of that Chriſtian Society remain in that Party which retains true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Piety, becauſe it is on that ſide that the truly Juſt and Faithful place themſelves. There it is that the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt is aſſembled in his Name, to which he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his preſence: for as I have before ſaid, Error, Superſtition and Injuſtice, give none a Right to be in a Society, nor by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence any to make thoſe Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>But, they will ſay, if the Body of the Paſtors be found in the other Party, if External Splendor, Multitude, Extent, Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Authority of Councils are found there, can any one forbear acknowledging it to be the Body of the Church? There are ſeen amongſt them the Pulpits, Schools, Churches, Biſhopricks, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Revenues, Dignities, and in a word, all thoſe advantages that mark out the Body of the Viſible Church. A Party that is in that condition, cannot ſuffer that any ſhould put its Rights in Queſtion, its Aſſemblies paſs for lawful throughout all the World, and the Aſſemblies only of the other Party are here Treated of, who finding themſelves ſpoiled of thoſe advantages, cannot be conſidered otherwiſe then as a Sect divided from the Body, as a Branch ſeparated from the Tree, or as a Ray divided from the Sun, according to the compariſon of the Fathers. I anſwer, That thoſe Diviſions that fall out in a mixed Church may be of two ſorts, for ſometimes they are founded only upon perſonal accuſations, or points of Diſcipline, or light and leſs important Queſtions, the Foundation of the Orthodox Doctrine, and true Worſhip remaining intire in both Parties. Of this ſort were the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> the <hi>Donatists,</hi> the <hi>Luciferians,</hi> as it has been noted in the Third Part. But ſometimes the ground of thoſe Diviſions is taken from Doctrine, or Worſhip, or the general
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97749:222"/>
Rules of Manners, and conſiſts in thoſe things that are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by both ſides to be weighty and eſſential, and in this Rank we may place thoſe Diviſions which aroſe in the Antient Church, by reaſon of the <hi>Samoſatenians,</hi> the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the <hi>Macedonians, Neſtorians</hi> and <hi>Eutychians.</hi> I acknowledge, that when the Queſtion is only about Diviſions of the former ſort, we cannot rationally hinder our ſelves from acknowledging that Party to be the Body of the Church which has the advantages before ſpoken of, and looking by conſequence on the other Party as a Sect cut from it. The one is the Tree, and the other the cut-off Branch, the one is the Sun, and the other a ſeparated Ray. And the Reaſon that makes that Prejudice Juſt, is not that the greater party cannot have done wrong at the bottom, or that it cannot erre. For it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens that Prejudice, Paſſion, Intereſt, Cabals, prevail among thoſe who have the Eccleſiaſtical Authority in their hands, which makes them give unjuſt Judgments, and it may be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Prejudices would not maintain all the deciſions and Excommunications of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Juſt. But the Reaſon of that Prejudice is, that though even the greater Part ſhould have done wrong in the Foundation, yet the matter treated on is not of ſuch importance, as that it can take away from a Society the Quality of the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt, while ſound Doctrine intirely ſubſiſts there, and Worſhip remains pure. From whence it follows, that there being there no ſufficient cauſe of Separation, the leſſer Party can't be looked upon otherwiſe then as Schiſmatical, becauſe it is cut off from the Greater with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſity; and ſuppoſing at the ſame time that it ſhould have Reaſon in the Foundation, yet its Separation would not ceaſe to be criminal. It is in this Caſe that Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> would have thoſe whom violence, or as he ſays, <hi>carnal Sedition,</hi> has driven from the Chriſtian Aſſemblies, to ſuffer patiently the injury done to them without throwing themſelves either into Hereſy or Schiſm, and without ſetting up of Aſſemblies apart, but that they ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and defend even to the death, the Faith which they know Preached in the Church. <hi>Sine ulla,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Conventiculorum ſegregatione uſque ad mortem defendentes &amp; Teſtimonio juvantes eam</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt. de vera. Relig.</hi> cap. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>fidem quam in Eccleſia Catholica praedicari ſciunt.</hi> But it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when the Diviſion is about matters of the Second ſort, thoſe I mean that are founded upon the weighty points of Doctrine or Worſhip. For then the true Church ought alone to be ſought for, where the true Faith is, where it is goes neither by extent of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97749:223"/>
places, nor by number, nor by the Body of Paſtors, or Prelates, nor by the Walls of Temples, nor by Councils that we ought to Judge of it, but by the true Doctrine, and where that is to be found, there without doubt is a Right to be in a Society and to gather Aſſemblies. The Reaſon is evident, becauſe we cannot ſay in that Caſe, that although the more numerous Party, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and which has the Body of Paſtors of its ſide, ſhould be wrong in the Foundation, yet that it would not always keep the quality of a true Church, as it may be ſaid in the former Caſe. For a Society that Teaches Error and practiſes a falſe Worſhip, and that will receive none into its Communion but thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that it believes, and practiſe all that it practiſes, cannot be a True Church, whatſoever advantages it have otherwiſe; ſo that finding it oppoſite to another pure Society, there is no need to heſitate in ones Choice.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Caſe, the leſſer Party cannot be other then Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, becauſe whatſoever Reaſon it may have at the bottom, it would be better to yield then to Separate ones ſelf, but it is not ſo in the Second, for it would be better to ſeparate ones ſelf then to yield, ſince in yielding one ſhould fall into Fundamental Errors and Superſtitions contrary to true Piety. In a word, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Caſe, the Number, Dignity, Extent of place, the Body of the Paſtors, Multitude, ought to prevail over Reaſon in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Injuſtice, becauſe a Church may be in ſome reſpect unjuſt, without hazarding the Salvation of its Children; but in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Reaſon drawn from Injuſtice, Error, falſe Doctrine, falſe Worſhip, is a thouſand times more conſiderable then all thoſe advantages which I have noted, becauſe we cannot renounce the true Doctrine, and the true Worſhip of God in things of great moment, in which our Salvation would not be abſolutely concerned. It is this difference that cauſes us to take notice of two different ways in the Fathers, which appear ſo oppoſite and contrary one to another, that at firſt ſight trouble our minds. For when they wrote againſt the <hi>Novatians</hi> or againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> or againſt the <hi>Luciferians,</hi> who ſeparated themſelves out of frivolous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that is to ſay, upon points of Diſcipline and perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, but who otherwiſe acknowledged the Church they had quitted, to be Orthodox, they ſet before the people, that Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Extenſion, the Body of the Paſtors, Succeſſion and other advantages of that Nature, as things that ſhewed of what ſide the Church was, and then they held that the leſſer Party cut off
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97749:223"/>
from the greater was as a Member divided from the Body, a Branch cut off from the Tree, or as a Ray Separated from the Sun. But when they were engag'd againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who taught falſe Doctrine, they did not care to make uſe of thoſe ſorts of Arguments; on the contrary they reſtrain'd themſelves to look for the Church where the True Doctrine and Faith was, and they had no Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either of the Body of the Paſtors, or of the Multitude, or Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, or Councils, when the <hi>Arrians</hi> made uſe of them to the Prejudice of the true Doctrine, as I have ſhewn in the Third Part. But that very thing evidently diſcovers the Ordinary Cheat that their Miſſionaries are guilty of, and the other petty Writers of Controverſy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and into which the Author of the Prejudices himſelf falls. Which is, that in ſtead of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing with reſpect to us the way of Writing that the Fathers took, when they wrote againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> from whom they differed in points of Doctrine, ſince the Cauſe is like, they follow on the contrary that that the ſame Fathers took againſt the <hi>Novations,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and <hi>Luciferians,</hi> with whom they did not quarrel about matters of Doctrine; which is a meer Sophiſm, where they confound two altogether different Queſtions, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to one Caſe that which cannot have any place but in the other.</p>
               <p>But they will ſay, Are not you your ſelf guilty of Fallacy, in perpetually ſuppoſing, as you do in this diſpute, that you have Right at the Bottom? For that is the thing that is moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, and when we alleadge to you the Body of the Paſtors, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, Multitude, and the other advantages of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we do not pretend to own, that the Doctrine of that Church is falſe, or that its Worſhip is corrupted, or to conclude that thoſe Advantages alone would give it the Quality of a True Church, though it ſhould not be <hi>Orthodox;</hi> but we pretend only, that ſetting aſide the Diſcuſſion of Doctrines, we can Convince you of Schiſm by thoſe Prejudices alone, which without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Examination, mark out which of the two Communions is the True Church, and by Conſequence which is falſe and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical. I have already anſwered Divers Times this Objection; but that it may be reviv'd here further in the Minds of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I ſhall not fail to ſhew yet farther the Vanity of it, and to diſcover more and more on which ſide the Fallacy lies. I ſay then, that when I ſuppoſe in this Diſpute that we have Right at the Bottom, my Suppoſition is juſt and within the Rules of good
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97749:224"/>
Reaſon, for I do not Suppoſe it either as a thing that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, nor as a thing granted to me, but as a Matter which ought to be Examin'd, and on the Examination of which that Queſtion of Schiſm, and the True Church, ought neceſſarily to depend. We would, ſay they, ſhew you, without entring into the Diſcuſſion of the Doctrine, by meer Prejudices that you are guilty of Schiſm, and that you have no Right to be in a Society, nor to gather Aſſemblies. And as for me I pretend to ſhew, that that way is Illuſory and Sophiſtical, and that one ought to examine the Doctrines in order, to know which of the two Communions is Schiſmatical, and which is the True Church. To this effect, I prove that though the Proteſtant Party ſhould be deſpoiled of all thoſe Advantages treated on, Provided it have on its ſide the True Doctrine and Worſhip, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have it not, it has all the Rights of a Chriſtian Society, that its Aſſemblies are Lawful, and that its Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is juſt, from whence it evidently follows, that all thoſe Prejudices are to no purpoſe in the deciding of our Queſtion, and that all depends on the Diſcuſſion of thoſe Points that are in Controverſy between us. See here the uſe of my Suppoſition, The Buſineſs at preſent is not to know whether we have Right in the Foundation or not; if that were all the Buſineſs, I would not ſuppoſe it at all, I would prove it; but the Buſineſs is to know whether they can by thoſe meer Prejudices prove that our Separate Aſſemblies from thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are unlawful. But I ſhew that they cannot, becauſe if we have Reaſon on our ſide in the Matters that are Controverted, our Aſſemblies are Lawfull, notwithſtanding thoſe Prejudices. In a word, we pretend to maintain our Aſſemblies no otherwiſe then by the Right that the Foundation gives us, but by that Right alone, we pretend to maintain them; ſo that when they Conteſt it with us we run back to the Foundation, and we ſhew them that the Foundation is ſufficient to render our Aſſemblies Lawfull, from whence it neceſſarily follows that they can't treat us as unjuſt and Schiſmaticks otherwiſe then in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Diſcuſſion of the Foundation it ſelf. When therefore they tell us, that to Convince us of Schiſm they need but to ſet aſide the Diſcuſſion of Doctrines, it is as much as if they ſhould ſay, that to ſhew us that we have no Reaſon, they need but to lay aſide that Reaſon upon which we ground our ſelves. The Author of the Prejudices has found this ſhift to be ſo Fine and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, that he has Judged it worthy to be Conſecrated to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by one of his Books.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97749:224"/>
In Fine, if we were to clear this Truth by Examples, we need but to repeat here two things which we have juſtified in the Third Part, and which are clear and certain out of the Hiſtory of the Antient Church. The one, That in the Time of the <hi>Arrians</hi> the Body of the Paſtors followed Hereſy; and the other, That a ſmall Number of the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> a ſmall Party ſeparated from the Body of its Paſtors, and ſpoiled of all thoſe kinds of Advantages, did not fail to ſet up its Aſſemblies apart, and to hold the beſt Chriſtian Society that it was poſſible for them to do. Thoſe that were Hereticks filled the Churches, and as for the <hi>Orthodox</hi> they met as they could, ſometimes in the Fields, and ſometimes even in the Churches of the <hi>Novatians.</hi> As theſe Matters of Fact are Indiſputable and Juſtified by Hiſtory, we have nothing elſe to do but to demand of the Author of the Prejudices, Whether he believes that thoſe <hi>Orthodox</hi> were Schiſmaticks for having ſo Separated themſelves from the Body of their Paſtors, not only by a Negative Separation, but even by a Poſitive one? Whether he believes that their Aſſemblies were Unlawfull? Whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that they had done better to have remained in the ſame Communion with Hereticks, then in withdrawing from them? Whether he thinks that the <hi>Arrians</hi> could have ſaid to them with any Reaſon, That without Entring upon any Examination of their Doctrine they could Convince them of Schiſm by that Separation alone? Whether he believes that thoſe <hi>Orthodox</hi> had given a very ill anſwer in ſaying, That ſince their Separation was only found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their Doctrine, it was by that that they ought to judge, and not by thoſe vain and deceitfull Advantages which ſometimes follow the Church, but which oftentimes Abandon it alſo, and upon which nothing of Certainty can be eſtabliſhed? The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Prejudices may anſwer what he pleaſes, but we are at leaſt aſſured that he can neither condemn the <hi>Arrians</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Juſtifying us, nor juſtify the <hi>Orthodox</hi> without Condemning himſelf.</p>
               <p>It is Neceſſary then that we come to agree in this Truth, That the Right to be in an External Society, and by Conſequence to raiſe Aſſemblies, belong to the truly Faithful only; and that if it falls out, that the Body of the Paſtors teaches falſe Doctrine, and corrupts the Miniſtry to that degree that it cannot be allowed to the Faithfull to live in Communion with them, The True Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full remain yet united among themſelves by that External Union out of which their Aſſemblies proceed, and that by Conſequence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97749:225"/>
they have a Right to meet together and to make up a Body in a viſible Communion. But they will ſay, If it falls out that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all the Paſtors forſake thoſe pretended True Faithfull where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you ſpeak, Who is there that ſhall Aſſemble them? they are all but ſo many meer private men, and what Right have thoſe private men to gather Aſſemblies? beſides, Religious Aſſemblies are chiefly Inſtituted for the Preaching of the Word, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sarraments, and can any aſcribe the Right of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Adminiſtring the Sacraments to meer private men Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their Paſtors? When therefore it ſhould be True that the Right of being in an External Society, That of making Aſſemblies, that of Preaching, That of Adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that of Binding and Looſing, and the whole Miniſterial Power ſhould reſide in the Faithfull only, yet it muſt be Confeſs'd notwithſtanding, That all thoſe Rights are to no purpoſe while they are Separated from their Paſtors, becauſe that each perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them being but a meer private man, they could not reduce thoſe Rights into Act, as they ſay, that is to ſay, They could not tell how to make any Actual Function. They have none who could join them together into a viſible Body, none among them can Lawfully Aſſemble them, none can Exerciſe the Functions of the Miniſtry among them, none can either Preach or Adminiſter the Sacraments, or Exerciſe the Power of the Keys. Whence it follows that whatſoever Right they have aſcribed to them, yet they do not ceaſe to be in that Condition in a True Diſperſion, according to what is ſaid in the Scripture, <hi>I will ſmite the Shepherd, and the Sheep ſhall be ſcattered abroad.</hi> And therefore Saint <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>That God has given ſome to be Apoſtles, others to be Prophets, others Evangeliſts, and others Paſtors and Teachers, for the Aſſembling of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> The Church in as much as ſhe is an External Society, is as an Organical Body, which has its noble parts neceſſary for Life, without which it could not ſubſiſt for a moment, and thoſe parts are her Paſtors, who are not it may be abſolutely neceſſary for the Subſiſtence of Faith and Piety in the Souls of particular men, but who are at leaſt abſolutely ſo for the Subſiſtance of that External Society, and the Publick Exerciſe of Religion. If they overthrow this Order, they change the Church into a raſh Aſſembly, made by Chance, and Licentiouſneſs, and of whoſe Convocation there can be no Reaſon given. Even the very name alone of the Church, which ſignifies a called Aſſembly, denotes,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97749:225"/>
that to aſſemble in a Body there ought to be a Lawful Call, which can be in none but the Paſtors. The Paſtors are then neceſſary to Bind an External Society; but they are yet further ſo, for the ſetting it in any Order, for otherwiſe it will depend on the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious humour of each private man to uſurp the Publick Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, each man will Imagine himſelf to have a Right to Preach the word of the Goſpell, to Adminiſter the Sacraments, and to do the other Functions of the Miniſtry, which would turn the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Anarchy. Theſe are to me the moſt ſpecious Objections that they can make againſt what I have ſaid concerning the Right that the Faithfull have to be in a Society, even then when they are Separated from the Body of their Paſtors, and they cannot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that I have weakned them, for they will not find any thing, either in that Book of the Prejudices, or it may be in all their other Controverſial Writings, that will appear to have as much Force and Likelihood of Truth, as that which I have gathered together in theſe few words.</p>
               <p>To Anſwer in ſome Order, I ſhall in the firſt place affirm, That that Objection does not any way touch the Body of the Proteſtants, ſince it is evident not only that all their Paſtors were not contrary to the Reformation, but alſo that in the greateſt part of thoſe places wherein it was made, thoſe who were moſt ardently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it were perſons high in Office and Dignity in the Latin Church, Who had as much a Call as they can reaſonably deſire to preſerve the Bond of Society intire, and to call Aſſemblies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. It is as certain that in divers places the Reformation was made by the conſent of the greateſt part of their Paſtors, as in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>Swedland,</hi> in <hi>Denmark,</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> in <hi>Heſſia</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and in many more Cities and Countrys in <hi>Germany.</hi> So that we may ſay with certainty, That the Reformed People Separated from the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion did not aſſemble of themſelves, but that they kept up an External Society under the lawful Miniſtry of a Conſiderable number of their Paſtors who called them together into a Body, or to ſpeak better, who hindred their diſperſion and preſerved the Bond of their Unity. They had in that Number their Monks, their Preachers, Prieſts, Curates, Canons, Doctors, Profeſſours in Divinity, whole Univerſities, and Abbies, Biſhops, Arch-Biſhops, Cardinals, and if the light of the Goſpel had not been then inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> they had had it may be <hi>Popes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for ſome of them were ſenſible enough of the Neceſſity
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97749:226"/>
of a Reformation. Howſoever it be, we may ſay, That there was yet in the Body of the Paſtors, a Remnant according to the Election of Grace, as there was in the Time of the <hi>Arrians</hi> according to the Remark of St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen.</hi> I confeſs that in ſome places the People of themſelves Aſſembled to Chuſe their Paſtors, but when they ſhould have been guilty of any irregularity in that, beſides that they cannot impute it to all the Body, it would have been rectified by the approbation that all the other Paſtors made of that Election, and by the right hand of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which they gave them, finding themſelves to be in the ſame Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies with them, and acknowledging them for their Brethren and Companions in the Work of Jeſus Chriſt. And by ſo much the more as the Times of Perſecution wherein the Faithful were then, often forced them to paſs over thoſe Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which it was impoſſible for them to obſerve, and as God himſelf ſeemed to have ratified the choice of thoſe perſons by the bleſſing which he ſpread upon their Labours, as he did particularly upon the Miniſtry of <hi>John le Maſon la Riviere,</hi> whom the people choſe at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Year 1555.</p>
               <p>But howſoever we are but a very little concerned in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples upon which that Objection is grounded, yet we ſhall not fail notwithſtanding to Examine them, to know a little more diſtinctly of what neceſſity Paſtors are for the ſubſiſtence of the Society or External Communion of the Church. I ſay then in the firſt place, it muſt not be thought that the Bond of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Society of the Faithful abſolutely depend on their Union, or as Cardinal <hi>du Perron</hi> ſpeaks, on their Adherence to the Body of their Paſtors. It may fall out ſometimes that the Body of the Paſtors, that is to ſay, the greater number of them, fall into Hereſy, and corrupt the Miniſtry in ſuch a manner as the Faithful would be bound to Separate themſelves from them. If there yet remain ſome few Paſtors who maintain the True Doctrine, and oppoſe Error, in that Caſe I ſay that the Faithful may moſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hold a Chriſtian Society with them in the uſing of all their Functions, aſſemble themſelves under their Miniſtry, hear the word of the Goſpel from their Mouths, and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from their hands. They cannot ſay that the Church would then be diſperſed, nor that the greater number of the Paſtors had carried away with them all the Rights of the Society, but they ought on the contrary to ſay that being obſtinate in Error, and abandoning the Purity of the Faith, they themſelves in that reſpect loſt the Right of being in the Society, and making up a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97749:226"/>
Body of an External Communion. For that Principle remains always unſhaken, that Error, Superſtition, and falſhood do not give the leaſt Right to any men to Aſſemble, and that a Society is Juſt only in proportion to that that it has of true Doctrine and Evangelical Worſhip. So that the greater number of the Paſtors is not a Party abſolutely neceſſary to the Body of the Church for its ſubſiſtence, and this appears evidently from the Example of the Orthodox in the Time of the <hi>Arrians;</hi> for as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, their External Communion did not ceaſe to ſubſiſt in divers places ſeparated from the Body of the Paſtors, they met together, they prayed to God in Common, they heard his word, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Sacraments; in a word, they performed all the actions of Religion under the Miniſtry of thoſe few perſons that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. This is preciſely the Caſe wherein our Fore-Fathers found themſelves in the Time of the Reformation, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewn, and it will not ſignify any thing to ſay that that ſmall number of Paſtors that our Fathers followed had themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to us corrupted their Miniſtry by the Errors and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions of the other Paſtors, and that they received their Call from their hands, for I affirm that their return to the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine rectified their Call, and freed it from all the impurity or ill it could have had, after the ſame manner that <hi>Felix</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Meletius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who being ordained by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> rectified their Miniſtry by Preaching the Truth and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Hereſy, and as <hi>Liberius</hi> and a great number of the other Biſhops who had ſubſcribed to <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> purified their Call in returning to the True Faith which they had forſaken. It is certain therefore that the greater number of the Paſtors is not a party of the Body of the Church abſolutely neceſſary for the ſubſiſtence of the External Communion, and that it is an Error to imagine that the bond of the Society depends on them, or that there can be no Aſſemblies made of thoſe who ſhall be ſeparated from them, but ſuch as are Unlawful and Schiſmatical.</p>
               <p>But in the Second place, I affirm that it is not even abſolutely neceſſary, and in all reſpects, to the making that External Society to ſubſiſt among the Faithful, that it ſhould have Paſtors. For as it is nature alone that makes man a Sociable living Creature, that is to ſay, that renders him capable of Civil Society, and gives him alſo a right to it, ſo alſo it is Grace which makes a Chriſtian a ſociable man, which renders him, I would ſay, capable of a Religious Society, and gives him a right to it. Ten Men that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97749:227"/>
ſhould meet one another hy Chance in an uninhabited Deſart, would they not have a Right to joyn themſelves actually together, to aſſemble and to take all the joynt deliberations in publick that they ſhould Judge neceſſary for their own preſervation? And would it not be an extravagance to demand of them what Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate had aſſembled them, what publick Authority had called them together, who had given them a right to ſpeak among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and to conſult for their common intereſts? Then when there are lawful Magiſtrates, their intervention is neceſſary for the calling and Authoriſing of Civil Aſſemblies, and if any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to aſſemble together without their Authority, or without their conſent, their Aſſemblies are raſh and unlawful, but it does not follow from thence that Magiſtrates ſhould be ſo abſolutely neceſſary to a Society, that when there ſhould be none, men could not any more ſpeak or act together, nor aſſemble themſelves, nor take common Conſultations. It is the ſame thing in Religion, if Ten Laymen of the Faithful ſhould meet together caſually, or to ſpeak better, if the ſole Providence of God ſhould make them meet one another in a Deſart Iſland, or in the fartheſt part of <hi>America,</hi> and engage them all their days in a ſtrange Land, and if they ſhould come to acknowledge each other for true Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtians, can any believe that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ought to remain ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed that they could never law<gap reason="illegible" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap> commune together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Chriſtian Faith and Pie<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> nor meet together to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the preſervation of their Religion. This is that which I hold, to be, not only unable to be maintained, but impious. For as Nature alone aſſembles men, when they have no Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and cannot have any; ſo Grace alone aſſembles Chriſtians when they have no Paſtors, and cannot have any. She will not ſuffer them to remain in an intire diſperſion while there remains yet any means to aſſemble them, it is ſhe alone that convokes or calls them together, and her inſtinct forms an unanimous conſent in them, that conſent alone renders their Aſſembly as lawful as it can be made by the Convocation of Paſtors. Thus alſo divers Parties who divided the Latin Church in the Time of the Great Schiſm of the Anti<hi>-Popes,</hi> proteſted, That they met together at the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> when they no more acknowledged the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor by conſequence, held any more a Head that could law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call them together, for they declared that they called one another together, and that they aſſembled themſelves <hi>ſub Capite Chriſto,</hi> under Jeſus Chriſt their common Head, that is to ſay,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97749:227"/>
by his inſtinct, and under his Authority, which ſuplied the want of a <hi>Pope. Quatenus,</hi> ſay they, <hi>in illo quieſt verus Eccleſiae ſponſus, congregati in unum ſimul, matrem Eccleſiam diviſam uniamus.</hi> In reſpect of an Aſſembly in the Body of a Council, each Biſhop, each Prelate was but a meer private man, as much as every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is in reſpect of an Aſſembly in the Body of the Church; and yet notwithſtanding they aſſembled, they reunited themſelves, they depoſed a falſe <hi>Pope</hi> who troubled them even then, and they created another. A mutual Convocation then, which is nothing elſe but an unanimous conſent, is ſufficient to make an Aſſembly lawful, when there is no Publick Authority that can call them together.</p>
               <p>This is that which juſtifies the Conduct of our Fathers in ſome places of this Kingdom at the beginning of the Reformation, for they Aſſembled ſometimes without any Paſtors, to pray to God together and to Read the Holy Scriptures, their Conſciences could not any more allow them to be preſent at the Aſſemblies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, and not having further any Paſtor who might Aſſemble them after the Ordinary manner, the Spirit of Chriſtianity Aſſembled them under the Soveraign Paſtor and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Souls which is Jeſus Chriſt, and their mutual conſent without doubt made their Society and their Aſſemblies moſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. For as to that which is ſaid in the Scripture, <hi>I will ſmite the Shepheard, and the Sheep ſhall be ſcattered abroad;</hi> it would be manifeſtly to abuſe that paſſage, if they would conclude from it an abſolute neceſſity of the Paſtors for the ſubſiſtence of that Society. For that is a Prophecy which notes, not that which the Faithful ought to do when they have no Paſtors, but that which ſhould befal the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt in the Time of his Paſſion, when the fury of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the ſad Condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſhould behold their Divine Maſter, ſhould force them to be ſcattered, which has nothing common to the Queſtion we are now Treating of.</p>
               <p>In the Third place I ſay, that to underſtand well the true uſe, and the Neceſſity of the Actions of the Miniſtry, the Church muſt be conſidered in two Seaſons, in her firſt formation and in her ſubſiſtence. For in her firſt formation it is certain that the Actions of the Miniſtry were neceſſary for the calling of men to the light of the Goſpel, whereof as yet they had no knowledge, and by Conſequence they were neceſſary to the Eſtabliſhment of the Chriſtian Communion or Society amongſt them, which could
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97749:228"/>
not be without that knowledge. To this end Jeſus Chriſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, <hi>Go,</hi> ſays he, and <hi>Teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Son,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.</note> 
                  <hi>and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and it is that to which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> has a chief regard when he ſays, <hi>That Chriſt has given ſome Apoſtles,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſome Prophets, and ſome Exangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors, and Teachers, for the gathering together of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> Thoſe glorious Heralds by the efficacy of their word, accompanied with the power of Jeſus Chriſt, called together the Church, if we muſt ſo ſay, as the Holy Aſſembly of God; they Eſtabliſhed the Chriſtian Religion in the World, and ſo united men among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in an External Society by the profeſſion of one and the ſame Faith, of one and the ſame Hope and Charity which inſpired them, ſo that the Acts of their Miniſtry were abſolutely neceſſary for that firſt Eſtabliſhment, becauſe their Preaching was the only means that God would make uſe of to draw men from the <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatry or the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Obſtinacy, and to give them that Faith without which they could never have had a Chriſtian Society. In this reſpect, there is Reaſon to urge the force of the word Church, which ſignifies not a raſh and tumultuary Aſſembly made by chance or Sedition, but an Aſſembly lawfully called, for it was God himſelf who called it by the voice of his Apoſtle according to the Prophecy of <hi>David. The mighty Lord, the Eternal God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.</note> 
                  <hi>hath ſpoken, and called to all the Earth, from the riſing up of the Son to the going down of the ſame. He has called the Heavens from on high, and the Earth to Judge his People; ſaying, Gather ye my Saints together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this firſt Eſtabliſhment the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts did three things: On one hand they ſpread abroad the Faith every where, and by this means bound men in an External Communion or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; on the other hand, they ſet together the Chriſtian Truths which are the Objects of Faith in the Cannon of the Scriptures; and in fine they eſtabliſhed Ordinary Paſtors for the upholding and Government of the Church. By the firſt of thoſe things, in Eſtabliſhing the Faith in mens hearts, they aſſembled, called them together, and put them into a Society, by the ſecond, they laid, as I may ſo ſpeak, the Fountain; or the External and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Magazine of the Evangelical Doctrine. By the Third, they provided for the Ordinary Diſpenſation of that Fountain, ſetling of Miniſters to diſtribute it by their Preaching, the Sacraments,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97749:228"/>
and the Exerciſe of Diſcipline. Of theſe three things, there is none but the firſt only to which we ought to refer the Convocation of the Church and Eſtabliſhment of the Chriſtian Society. But we muſt ſay that all Three ſerve for its preſervation and increaſe, for they are ſo many ways and means which the Apoſtles left for the preſervation of the Faith, and ſtrengthning of it in thoſe who had before received it, and to propagate it to their Children, and in thoſe who had not as yet received it, in which the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a Society conſiſts. The firſt contributes much, for as Lights or Torches lighted all together preſerve and mutually ſtrengthen their fire, and are capable of lighting others; So many faithful Chriſtians united together, confirm one another in the Faith and Piety, and are fit to Communicate that Faith and Piety to thoſe who have not yet received it. The Second does not contribute leſs, for the Faithful preſerve and increaſe their light, their Faith, Piety, Sanctity, by the immediate Reading of the Holy Scriptures; Infidels themſelves may be converted this way, and thoſe that go aſtray be brought back to the purity of the Goſpel. The Third is alſo of exceeding great Uſe, for the Paſtors by their Preaching, their Direction, and their Writings, by their Examples, by the Sacraments they Adminiſter, and in a word by all the Actions of their Miniſtry, confirm the Faith where it is, and propagate it where it is not. The Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has ſo prepared its divers means for the preſervation of that Society, and the Propagation of his Church, That if the Actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Miniſtry do not produce that effect for which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the other means ſhall, and ſupply that defect. In Effect when the publick Preaching and preſence of the Paſtors fail, the Reading of the Scripture, private Exhortation of the ſimple Chriſtians, the writings of their Paſtors, either dead or abſent, may come to ſuccour, and make the Faith and Charity and Piety ſubſiſt, and by conſequence the External Society of the Church and its Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>How then are the Actions of the Miniſtry neceſſary? They are ſo firſt, By Neceſſity of Precept, as they ſpeak; I mean as it is a means that Jeſus Chriſt has ordained, the Uſe whereof we cannot neglect without ſin. Thoſe who contemn it, reſiſt the Order that God himſelf has eſtabliſhed, and make themſelves unworthy of his Grace; and to this thoſe paſſages in the Scripture refer, which recommend the Paſtors to the Faithful. <hi>He that heareth you heareth me, and he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me. Obey</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:97749:229"/>
                  <hi>them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your Souls.</hi> 2. The Actions of the Miniſtry are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Churches well being, though not abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to its being. It is not abſolutely impoſſible for a Church to ſubſiſt without having actually any Paſtors, not only becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Faith and Piety may ſubſiſt without their heavenly food, which is the Word and Sacraments, as a Body may ſubſiſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without its nouriſhments, but alſo becauſe one part of that food may come to us otherwiſe then from the mouth of the Paſtors, as I have ſhewn. But they are neceſſary to the well being of a Church, but it is the hand of the Paſtors alone that diſpences the Sacraments to us, and their Preaching is a publick inſtruction that more ſtrongly ſets before our Eyes the Truths of the Goſpel, that livelily applies its Precepts, its Promiſes, its Threatnings, and its Exhortations to us, and frequently forces us to make thoſe Reflections on our ſelves which we ſhould not do without their Aid. Their Authority reſtrains us, their light inlightens us, their Direction guides us, their Example excites us, and their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours caſe ours. It is certain that a Flock without a Paſtor cannot but be in a very bad condition, for howſoever each of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Sheep who compoſe it may defend themſelves againſt the aſſaults of the Wolves, yet it is not ordinarily done either with ſuch force, or ſuch ſucceſs as when the defending of them lies in the hands of Faithful Paſtors to whom God communicates a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er meaſure of his Light and Grace; and although the External Society among the ſimple Faithful may not ceaſe to ſubſiſt though they have not actually any Paſtor, ſince they may be joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Jeſus Chriſt by the profeſſion of one ſame Faith, and the ſame Piety which aſſembles them, by vertue of the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation that the Apoſtles made, yet that Society, as far as it is External, would be far better maintained by the Actions of the Miniſtry of the Paſtors, then it would be otherwiſe. 3. I ſhall not fear to ſay that even the Actions of the Miniſtry are neceſſary for the perpetual ſubſiſtence of that External Society, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the meer Reading of the Word of God, Publick Prayers in Common, the mutual Exhortations of the Faithful, and the Writings of the Doctors of the Church, are without doubt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to preſerve the Faith and Piety in the Souls of men, not only during ſome time, but even always, if they do not neglect their duty, yet notwithſtanding it muſt be acknowledged that according to the way that we are made, and to ſpeak as they ſay
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97749:229"/>
after the manner of men, a Flock cannot abide a long Time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Shepherd, ſo as not to fall into Negligence, and by that Negligence into an Oblivion of its duty, and in fine, ſo as the Sheep ſhould not be in a great danger of diſperſion. See here after what manner Paſtors are neceſſary to the Church, but to imagine that it cannot abſolutely have any more a Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, or lawful Aſſemblies among the Faithful, when their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Paſtors forſake them, is that which they can never main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with any Reaſon, For the Faithful are the Sheep of Jeſus Chriſt, and when their Paſtors ſcatter them, the Grace and Name of Jeſus Chriſt calls them together, They are in a Society by the right of the firſt Convocation of the Church, which is a perpetual right, which ſubſiſts every where, where the True Faith and true Chriſtian Piety are found Common among many perſons, and it is from that perpetual and immovable Right that that of the actual Aſſemblies Flowes.</p>
               <p>But what Order can they hold in their Aſſemblies, ſince they have none to direct them Externally? I anſwer, That the ſame Spirit of Grace which inſpired them with Piety and Charity, would it ſelf ſuggeſt an Order and ſubject them one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other by a mutual conſent; for God does not forſake his own Children, though men and the Church may always ſay in the Languague of the Prophet, <hi>When my Father and Mother forſake</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.</note> 
                  <hi>me, the Lord ſhall take me up.</hi> If there be any Magiſtrate to be found among the Faithful, it belongs to him to ſettle an Order among them, for the Civil Society comes in Naturally to the ſuccour of the Religious, when the Religious is caſt into any Extremity. If there be no Magiſtrate they ought to agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Order in private Conferences, before they come to Aſſemble together in a Body, to avoid Confuſion, and every one has a Right to make thoſe private Conferences.</p>
               <p>But what can they do in thoſe Aſſemblies? They may pray to God there, they may implore the ſuccours of his Providence, and put their Truſt in his Promiſes. They muſt begin by that Afterwards they will ſearch out all poſſible means to have Paſtors called to that Office by the Ordinary ways, to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Preaching of the Goſpel from them; but if that is impoſſible, or if they ſee that that would be evidently to Tempt God, and put the Flock in danger of diſſipation, it is Neceſſary in that caſe that the Flock ſhould chuſe a Paſtor for it ſelf, and Conſecrate him to God by ardent Prayers, in committing to his Truſt the Rights of the Miniſtry that reſide in the Body of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97749:230"/>
Faithful, to whom Jeſus Chriſt, according to Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> has given the Power of the Keys. For we ought not to imagine that the Body of the Faithful ſhould be ſtripped of the Right of the Miniſtry as often as they ſhould be actually without Paſtors. That Right is inviolable, it cannot be either loſt or ſeparated from the Body of the Faithful. We will in the Cloſe examine whether an Election made after that manner gives a ſufficient Call; it is ſufficient at preſent to know that neither the Right of a Chriſtian Society, nor that of Chriſtian Aſſemblies, is ſo neceſſarily tied to the Paſtors, That when there ſhould be none of them, the Faithful could not remain united together externally in a Body of a Viſible Church, or make thoſe Aſſemblies law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Prejudices Treating about this matter, diſtinguiſhes between two ſorts of Separations, the one Negative, the other Poſitive. <hi>There is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a meer Negative Separation which conſists more in the denyal of certain Acts of Communion, then in poſitive Actions againſt that Society from which one ſeparates.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prejug.</hi> Chap. 7. Pag. 147.</note> 
                  <hi>And there is another Poſitive Separation which includes the erecting of a Separate Society, the Eſtabliſhment of a new Miniſtry, and the poſitive Condemnation of the former Society to which he was united.</hi> He ſays afterwards, <hi>That we did not content our ſelves with the firſt kind of Separation, that we have gone further, that we have formed a new Society, a new Church, that we have ſet up new Paſtors; That it is that kind of Separation whereof he accuſes us, and that it is this alſo that we ought to Juſtify our ſelves about.</hi> He repeats the ſame things in the end, and concludes, That when the Faithful ſhould believe themſelves obliged out of a good Conſcience to ſeparate themſelves Negatively, they ought not to form a Society, nor have any Paſtors; <hi>But, that they ought to remain in that State without any Paſtors, and without any External Worſhip, in waiting until God extraordinarily raiſe up ſome with viſible Characters of their Miſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I acknowledge that that Diſtinction of two kinds of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is of ſome Uſe, and I have my ſelf made uſe of it for the putting of the matters of this Treatiſe into a more natural Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but I deny that the Conſequences which the Author of the Prejudices pretends to draw from them, are True. We ſhall ſee in the ſequel, whether the Society of the Proteſtants ſeparated from thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> may with any reaſon be called a new Church: We ſhall ſee alſo what Right they had to a Goſpel-Miniſtry,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97749:230"/>
and whether they can ſay that their Miniſtry is new, I conſider only that Principle which he propounds, which is, That when the Faithful ſeparate themſelves Negatively from thoſe with whom they were before united, they ought not to ſet up a Society apart. For he knows not how to ſay any thing that is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Piety and the Spirit of Chriſtianity. I hold then that if that Negative Separation of the Faithful be Juſt, if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, if they made it out of a good Conſcience, not only they can, but they ought to hold a Chriſtian Society among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to make a Viſible Body, to Aſſemble, to pray to God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to Read his Word, to conſult and deliberate for their common Intereſts, even while they ſhould be ſeparated from the greater number of the Ordinary Paſtors, or even when they ſhould have no Paſtors among them. I mean that that is not only a Right but a Duty, an Obligation, and ſuch an Obligation that there is nothing can diſpence with but an abſolute and invincible impoſſibility. The Reaſon upon which I found this Propoſition is taken from the very Nature of the Chriſtian Faith, Piety and Charity. For when God has given us theſe vertues, he has by that very thing indiſpenſably bound us to keep and ſtrengthen them, and by conſequence he has bound us to practiſe thoſe means which he himſelf has eſtabliſhed for that purpoſe. But among thoſe means, That of External Communion with our Brethren to whom he has given the ſame grace, is one of the moſt conſiderable, as I have ſaid before. Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> told the believing <hi>Hebrews, Let us take heed to ſtir up one another to Charity</hi>

               <p>Moreover, according as our Brethren labour on their part in the preſervation and confirmation of our Faith, Piety, Hope, and Charity, by the Society that we hold with them, ſo we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame effect in reſpect of them, for we mutually edify one another. But it is further a Duty to which Chriſtianity engages us. God would not that we ſhould only labour for our own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97749:231"/>
he would have us alſo take care of that of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and it would be a deteſtable word in the mouth of a Chriſtian, if he ſhould ſay with <hi>Cain, Am I my Brothers keeper?</hi> We are further bound to propagate our Faith and Piety in the Souls of our Children, and to labour even to the utmoſt of our power to make it ſpring up in the Souls of Infidels, as one lighted candle may light another; which evidently notes that the Inſtinct of Chriſtianity, is an inſtinct of Society that carries us out not only to own our Brethren, when they are ſo, but to gain more then we had before, and even thoſe which we cannot have.</p>
               <p>In fine, Piety would have us give God the higheſt honour and Worſhip that it is poſſible for us to give him. But it is certain <note place="margin">This paſſage yet cleared in the Orig. Pag. 321.</note> that God is more honoured in a Society, when all in one Body offer up their Prayers to him, their vows and their praiſes, then when each does it apart, more hearts united together pay God a homage more worthy of his Majeſty. They cannot then imagine a State more contrary to the nature of the true Faith, of Chriſtian Piety and Charity, than that of Diſperſion, nor by conſequence any thing that the Faithful ought to have more horror for, and when the miſery of the Age ſhall caſt them into it by an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neceſſity, they ought always to preſerve a Spirit of Society, and to pant after the company of their Brethren. <hi>My Soul,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> then when he was in that Condition, <hi>Thirſteth after God, after the living and true God, O when ſhall I come and appear before</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.</note> 
                  <hi>the preſence of God! My Tears have been my meat Day and Night, while they ſay unto me, Where is now thy God? I remember the Time wherein I went with the multitude, and when I went ſweetly in company with others, with the voice of Triumph, and praiſe, unto the Houſe of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſo certain, that the Actual diſperſion of the Faithful does not break the natural bond of their Society, for they are always Brethren, Children of the ſame Family, it can only ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Acts of it, and when that abſolute neceſſity which forced them into diſperſion is gone, they return of themſelves naturally into an actual Society, by the force of that Unity of Faith and Religion that is among them, without any neceſſity of a new Convocation. It will ſignify nothing to ſay that the Duties which I have noted reſpect the Faithful only then when they are already in an Actual Society, but that they are not bound to remain there, nor to enter into it, when they have no Paſtors to Aſſemble them. For I ſay that thoſe Duties ariſe not from the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97749:231"/>
nature of that Society, but from that of Faith, Piety, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and by conſequence they bind them to preſerve an actual Society, where-ever it is, and even to make one where it is not yet; that is to ſay, they oblige us to United all thoſe to us in whom we ſee the ſame Faith, Piety, and Charity ſhine forth, that we perceive in our ſelves.</p>
               <p>In a word, ſince Faith, Piety, Charity, and the other Chriſtian Vertues, bind us to thoſe Duties, they bind us alſo to an External Society, without which they cannot be performed, whence it comes to paſs, that the Faithful are called in the Scripture Sheep, not in reſpect of their Ordinary Paſtors, but in reſpect of their Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; to note, That it is the Faith and not the Miniſtry which makes the Society, and which renders by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence their Aſſemblies lawful and neceſſary.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Society of the Proteſtants, is not a New Church.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>ONe of the moſt Ordinary and powerful means that they make uſe of to render us odious to the People, and to drive them from our Communion, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent us to them as Innovators, and full of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, who have overthrown all, and made a new Religion, and a new Church; and it is very true that the greateſt part of the World Judges of things no otherwiſe then by what they tell them, and by ſome light appearances, without informing themſelves any further. Nevertheleſs it is certain that there never was a more unjuſt Accuſation then that, nor whoſe injuſtice could be more eaſily ſeen, if they would but open their Eyes a little. For as to that which reſpects that pretended Novelty of Religion which they ſay that we have introduced, I would fain have them mark out ſome poſitive Articles of our Faith, that were not always believed in the Chriſtian Church, and which they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themſelves to this day do not believe in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ways ſcrupling them. I confeſs that they may have among them ſome Queſtions of the School about which our poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Doctrine is different from that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Queſtion of the Nature of Concupiſcence, that of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of the Soul of Jeſus Chriſt, and that of the Definition of the Faith.</p>
               <p>But beſides that thoſe Queſtions are very few in Number, and that they are ſcarce known by the People, we have the Holy Scriptures ſo clearly on our ſide upon all thoſe points, that they cannot lay any Novelty to our Charge, and for the reſt all our great Differences conſiſt in reſpect of us, in Negative Articles, that is to ſay, in thoſe points which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes, and which we do not believe, as the Sacrifice of the Maſs, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, Oral Manducation, Adoration of the Hoſt, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, Invocation of Saints and Angels, Religious Worſhip of Images, that of Relicks, the Divine Service in an unknown Tongue, the Neceſſity of the Caelibacy of the Clergy, the merit
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97749:232"/>
of good works, the Authority of Traditions, the Monarchy of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> her Soveraign power over mens Conſciences, and other ſuch like Doctrines. It is True that we have rejected thoſe Doctrines, but ſince it is alſo true that we have rejected them only becauſe they are Novelties that men have added to God's <hi>Revelation,</hi> beyond which there can be nothing in Religion that ſhould not be new, what ground have any of them to accuſe us as Innovators? They would have far more ground to ſay that we are too rigid Followers of Antiquity, and that we urge our Scruples and our Averſions for theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties further then we ought, or at leaſt that we deceive our ſelves, and take that for new, which indeed is not ſo, If they ſaid no more but that, we ſhould labour to juſtify our ſelves; but to charge us under that pretence with a Spirit of Novelty, is the moſt unreaſonable and groundleſs thing in the World. That which makes the Fallacy is, That the people, whoſe ſight is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſhort, and who Judge of the Novelty and Antiquity of things only by that which appears open to them, imagine that all that which they received from their Fathers, and which they found ſetled when they came into the World, is Antient through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; ſo that a falſe Antiquity which ſhall be only of two or three Ages paſt, paſſes in their Judgments for as good and true a one as if it had been always ſo. Notwithſtanding which, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that in matters of Religion, nothing can be truly Antient but that which was from the beginning, and nothing can be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine but that which is from Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles; for it is a thing very evident and acknowledged on both ſides, that from the Time of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, There has been no immediate <hi>Revelation;</hi> whence it follows, That all that which is ſprung up ſince, is humane, and by conſequence New. This is the True <hi>Idea</hi> that we ought to form of Old and New, and not that popular <hi>Idea,</hi> which cannot but be falſe and deceitful, and yet notwithſtanding it is upon this latter that they ground themſelves when they accuſe us to have been Innovators, and to have made a new Religion: as if Jeſus Chriſt had been an Innovator then, when he would correct the abuſes that the <hi>Jews</hi> committed in their Divorces, by telling them, <hi>In the beginning it was not ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is after the ſame manner that they charge us with having made a new Church, for they play upon the Equivocalneſs of the word, <hi>New.</hi> The People who imagine that all that which appears
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97749:233"/>
to them in another form then that which they have been wont to ſee, is new, believe that our Society is new, becauſe they ſee that we do not Aſſemble our ſelves any more with them as we did before, that we have other places then the uſual, that we do not any more ſay <hi>Maſs</hi> in our Aſſemblies, that we hold another Order, and that we have other Miniſters.</p>
               <p>But there needs here only a Diſtinction: For a thing is called New either with reſpect to its being and its Eſſence, in reſpect of its External State, and its changeable Accidents. When an Infant comes into the World, they ſay a new man is born, when a new Houſe or Town is built where there none before, they ſay it is a new Town, or a new Houſe; and the ſame may be ſaid when one thing is eſſentially changed into another thing, as when God changed <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod <hi>into a Serpent,</hi> or when Jeſus Chriſt changed the water of <hi>Cana</hi> into Wine, it might be ſaid that it was a new thing, becauſe in effect it was not eſſentially the ſame thing that it was before. But when it is only changed in its State or External Form, as when a Man changes his countenance, his Stature or his Inclination, manner of acting, or Cloaths, or when he repairs a Houſe or a Town, if then any ſhould ſay this were a new thing, without doubt he would ſpeak improperly. It is not leſs manifeſt, that it is no more then a ſigurative Expreſſion, which ought not to be taken litterally, nor in a rigorous ſence. So when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls a converted man a new Man, a new Creature, and the Church a new Heaven, a new Earth, a new World, every one ſees that theſe are ways of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ought not to be taken literally, but figuratively; for a Believer is eſſentially the ſame man, and the ſame Creature of God that he was before his Converſion, and Heaven, Earth, and the World are not changed in their Eſſence by the manifeſtation of the Goſpel. Beſides a thing that is changed in its external Form may be called new, either with reſpect to the State wherein it was immediately before its change, or with reſpect to the Juſt and lawful State wherein it ſhould be according to its firſt Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment; ſo when one repairs a ruined Houſe, if it keeps its firſt proportion, We may ſay that it is made new in reſpect of what it was before its Reparation, but if its firſt and natural Faſhion ſhould be changed, it would be new, even in reſpect of what it ſhould have been according to the Model by which it was made at firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:97749:233"/>
Theſe Diſtinctions clear this whole Diſpute, and it is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to apply them to the ſubject we are upon. For if they mean, That the Society or Church of the Proteſtants is new in reſpect of the State wherein it was, or of that external form which it had, immediately before the Reformation; we ſhall voluntarily agree that it is made new in that ſence, after the ſame manner that the Scripture calls the Regenerate a new Man, or as God promiſes to give us a new heart, or as they call a Houſe repaired, and put into its natural State, a new Houſe. That would ſpeak the Favour God ſhew'd to our Fathers, in re-eſtabliſhing the Chriſtian Society in that Juſt and lawful State, wherein it ought to be according to its firſt Eſtabliſhment, and that that State is very much different from that wherein it was immediately before the Reformation: This is that which we do not deny, and are ſo far from it, that on the contrary we praiſe and glorify God for it. But if they mean that we have made a new Church, that is to ſay, one eſſentially differing from that which Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles would eſtabliſh in the World, and which has always ſubſiſted even to our days, or that, in all that, which depends on us, we have not re-eſtabliſhed it in its firſt and lawful State, this is what we deny; and in this ſence, which is the only one that can render the Accuſations of our Adverſaries juſt, we maintain, that we have not in the leaſt made a new Church. In a word, we ſay, that the Church of Jeſus Chriſt has ſubſiſted down from the Apoſtles to us incluſively, in all that which it has Eſſentially, and that ſhe yet ſubſiſts at this day among us, but that having changed her State or External Form in the Ages that preceeded the Reformation, ſhe was re-eſtabliſhed in her juſt and lawful State by the Reformation of our Fathers, which no ways hinders but that ſhe was, and might always be the ſame Church.</p>
               <p>To make this Truth to be the better underſtood, we need only to clear on the one ſide what that Eſſence of the Church is, that ought always to remain immovable, to ſhew that it may be but one and the ſame Church by deſcent and uninturrepted Succeſſion, and on the other ſide what State it is that ſhe has ſuffered change in, and how it could be altered and repaired. The Eſſence of the Church conſiſts in this, That it is a Body of divers perſons united together in the Commnion of one only True God, under one only Jeſus Chriſt their Head and Mediatour; and it is Jeſus Chriſt himſelf that has given us this <hi>Idea</hi> of it, when he ſays that, <hi>This is life Eternal to know the only True God and Jeſus Chriſt whom</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 17.</note>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:97749:234"/>
                  <hi>he has ſent,</hi> That Definition which we give of the Church ſuppoſes, 1. The ſubject, or matter whereof the Church is compoſed, which are divers men, divers perſons united among themſelves, and with God. 2. It ſuppoſes the Neceſſary means, without which that Communion cannot be, which are the word of the Goſpel and the Holy Spirit. 3. It contains not only the True Faith, Charity, Hope, which are the natural bonds of that Communion, but all the other Chriſtian Vertues alſo, as Worſhip, Adoration, Truth, Obedience, Thanksgiving, Juſtice, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the the duties to which that Communion engages us. 4. It comprehends in it further, all the fruits that we gather from that Communion, as Remiſſion of Sins, Peace and Tranquillity of Soul, Conſolation in Afflictions, Succours in Temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. In fine, it includes all the Rights that neceſſarily follow that Communion, as that of being joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an External Society, that of Publick Aſſemblies, that of the Miniſtry, that of the Sacraments, and that of External Government and Diſcipline. See here that which is Eſſential to the Church, for I call that Eſſential, without which the Church cannot ſubſiſt, and which yet is ſufficient to make it ſubſiſt; that which cannot ſubſiſt if that Church fail to ſubſiſt, and that which cannot be wanting if there be a Church.</p>
               <p>As to the State in reſpect of which it ſuffers changes, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in all that that depends on the different diſpoſition of Times, Places, and Perſons. For Example, To have the Bodily preſence of Jeſus Chriſt, to have Apoſtles and Evangeliſts for its Paſtors, to have the Miraculous gifts of healing, that of Tongues, that of the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Faithful by Viſible Symbols, that of Prophecy, and that of an external and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible direction and inſtruction, is a State wherein the Church was in the Time of its Birth, but which was changed in the other Times that followed. To have Paſtors illuſtrious for Zeal, Learning and Piety, as a Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> a Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> a Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> is a State wherein it was not always, nor every where, but in ſome Times and Places only. To be flouriſhing and in Peace, without Perſecution, without Schiſm, without Error, is a State wherein it has neither been always, nor in all Places, nor in reſpect of all thoſe perſons who have compoſed it, but which it has been in, in ſome Times and Places only, and with reſpect to ſome Perſons. We ought then to ſet down in their proper Order thoſe things which belong to the State of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97749:234"/>
Church, and to its Eſſence, and which by Conſequence are liable to change, as to be extended every where, or in the greateſt part of the World, to have a multitude, or the greateſt number, Temporal Splendor or outward Glory, Peace, whether in regard of thoſe without, or in reſpect of thoſe within, Liberty in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Profeſſion, Viſibility of Aſſemblies, Purity of the Miniſtry, Holineſs of External Worſhip, Form of Government, that of Diſcipline, and that of Liturgies, an Actual Bond of the Parts of the Church in one Body of External Communion, and the Actual Exerciſe of the Miniſtry, or if you will, the Actual Preſence of the Paſtors. All thoſe are things that do not abſolutely belong to the Eſſence of the Church, but only to its State or Condition, and of which it may be ſometimes ſpoyled either wholly or in Part, without being abſolutely deſtroyed. It may be reſtrained to a few places, and a few perſons, and therefore it is called in ſome places of Scripture <hi>a little Flock,</hi> ſhe may be ſo, in her low State. <hi>We are,</hi> ſays Saint <hi>Paul, not many wiſe, not many mighty, not many noble, but God has choſen the weak things of this World to confound the ſtrong.</hi> She may be in Trouble and in Affliction through the Perſecution of Infidels, as ſhe was under the Heathen Emperours, or in Fighting againſt Hereticks, as ſhe has been almoſt always; ſhe may loſe the Viſibility of her Aſſemblies, as ſhe did in moſt places in the Time of <hi>Decius,</hi> and <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> ſhe may find her Miniſtry corrupted, as it hapned in the Time of the <hi>Arrians;</hi> ſhe may ſee her external Worſhip ſullied by Actions of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry, as it fell out in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the days of the Prophets. As to the Form of her Government, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny that in that reſpect ſhe has not under-went divers changes; I do not mention the Introduction of the Epiſcopal Order, for that is a Queſtion, but I ſpeak of thoſe changes that have befel her, through the Uſurpations and Conteſts of the firſt See's, and chiefly by the Uſurpations of that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the greateſt part of the World will own to have been very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
               <p>Her Diſcipline and her Liturgies have alſo undergone many Changes, and they cannot in that regard aſcribe any Uniformity to the Church, either in reſpect of Times or Places. In fine, ſhe has ſometimes beheld the Body of her Ordinary Paſtors turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt her ſelf, ſhe has ſeen a great part of her true Children ſcattered, and diſperſed here and there, without being able to perform any Acts of an External Society; and ſhe has ſeen ſome
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97749:235"/>
of her Flocks deprived of their Paſtors, and forced to ſet up ſome among themſelves in the room of thoſe who had abandoned them. For all that fell out in the days of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the Councils deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Hereſy; the greateſt part of the Orthodox, who oppoſed themſelves to their Impiety, were either baniſhed or forced to fly into the Deſarts, and according to the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiphan. Haer.</hi> 73. <hi>comm.</hi> 28.</note> divers People who ſaw that their Biſhops were turned <hi>Arrians</hi> in the Council of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> looked on them as the miſerable Deſertors of their Miniſtry, and ſet up themſelves other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of thoſe Changes that fall out in the Church come from two ſources; the one, That ſhe is mixed with the Worldly and Profane in the band of the ſame External Profeſſion; and the other, That the Truly Faithful themſelves, who only are the Church of Jeſus Chriſt, as truly Faithful as they are, fail not to have a great many other imperfections, their knowledge is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, their Righteouſneſs is accompanied with its faults, their Inclinations are not all right, and even their moſt juſt Inclinations do not fail to have ſome farther irregularity. Theſe two Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains produce an heap of evils and diſorders, the Worldly on their part bring thither Covetouſneſs, Ambition, Pride, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionativeneſs, contempt of God, his Myſteries, and Worſhip, Politick Deſigns, Worldly Intereſts, a Spirit of Grandeur, Luxury, Superſtitions, Hereſies, Love of Dominion, Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Opinion of Infallibility, Forgeries, and all other Perverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the heart of Man. The Faithful they bring thither on their ſide, their Ignorance, their Negligence, their Fearfulneſs, their Simplicity, and ſometimes their Paſſions, their Perſonal Intereſts and Vices. From all which a <hi>Chaos</hi> is made up of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Confuſion, a Myſtery of Iniquity, a Spiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> that perpetually makes war againſt the Church, which reduces her ſometimes into very ſtrange Extreamities, and which would without doubt deſtroy her, if her Eternal Head did not keep her up above all. I acknowledge that the Spirit of God fights againſt that <hi>Babylon</hi> on the Churches ſide, and that he preſides over that <hi>Chaos,</hi> to expel thoſe Confuſions, and to hinder the Churches Periſhing. But it muſt not be imagined under a pretence of that preſence of the Spirit of God, that there never happens any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in it. He indeed always preſerves the Eſſence of the Church, but he frequently permits her State to be altered. This is the Effect that that heap of Crimes, Vices, and Imperfections
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97749:235"/>
may produce which I have mentioned as well on the ſide of the Truly Faithful, as on that of the Worldly. They never go ſo far as to deſtroy her intirely, but they go ſo far ſometimes as to ſpoil her of her Ornaments, of her External Advantages, and even of her very Health, if I may ſo ſpeak; and therefore Jeſus Chriſt told his Diſciples, <hi>In the World you ſhall have Tribulation,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>but be of good cheer I have overcome the World.</hi> God has always preſerved, and he will preſerve to the end of all Ages, a Body of many perſons united together in the Communion of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. This Body can never periſh, it can never ceaſe to be, nor loſe any thing that is abſolutely neceſſary to its ſubſiſtence; but it may be deprived of its large Extent, Temporal Splendor, Worldly Glory, Peace, Reſt, and Viſibility. It may ſee its Miniſtry Corrupted, in as much as it is in the hands of men, it may ſee its External Worſhip diſhonoured, and Error and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition fill its Pulpits, <hi>Poſſeſs its Schooles,</hi> and diffuſe it ſelf over its Councils; its true Members may be hindred from making ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Aſſemblies, and a Body of a Viſible Communion, and it may be abandoned by its Paſtors, and reduced to a Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Creating others. See here what the State of the Church is.</p>
               <p>Upon all theſe Illuſtrations, it will be no difficult matter to decide the Queſtion concerning the Novelty and Antiquity of our Church. For if we have made a Society eſſentially different from that which Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles formed at the firſt, and which has all a long ſubſiſted down from his Birth to this preſent, if we cannot juſtly ſay, That we are a Body of many Perſons united together in the Communion of one only true God, under one only Jeſus Chriſt our Head and Mediatour, if they can with any ground conteſt with us the Unity of the True Chriſtian Faith, Piety and Holineſs; in one word, if we want any thing that is neceſſary to the Conſtitution of the Church and its ſubſiſtence, or if there be any thing in us that hinders that that good which we have does not produce its effect, to give us the Form and Nature of a True Church, it is certain, that we have made a new Church, and by a Conſequence a falſe and an Adulterous Church. But if we can truly and juſtly glorify God for all that which makes up the Eſſence of a True Church, if our Faith is ſound, if our Piety is pure, if our Charity is ſincere, if we can upon good grounds maintain that God preſerves and upholds in the External Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of that Body which we compoſe, the Truly Faithful

and Juſt perſons, who only, as I have ſaid often, are the Church, it is certain alſo that there is nothing more unjuſt then that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of a New Church which they charge us with. There never was in the World any other Church of God then that of his truly juſt and Faithful Ones, that Body only is in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Father and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, that alone is intruſted with the Truth, that alone is animated by the Holy Spirit, that alone is God's Inheritance, his People, his Vine, his encloſed Garden, his Houſe and Myſtical Family, as the Scripture calls it, that alone in fine has all the Rights of the Eccleſiaſtical Society, the Right of External Aſſemblies, that of the Miniſtry, Sacraments, Government, and Diſcipline. Let the Author of the Prejudices and his Brethren ſtir themſelves as much as they pleaſe, let them animate one another, let them cry out, write Prejudices and invectives never ſo much againſt us, let them do all that they pleaſe, we are firm and fixed upon two Principles againſt which we are ſure they cannot do any thing. The one, That if our Communion Teaches the True Doctrine, if it has the True Worſhip, and the True Rules of Chriſtian Sanctity, to a degree ſufficient for Salvation, and if the Cauſes for which we ſeparated our ſelves from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were Juſt, God nouriſhes and preſerves his True Faithful Ones in our Communion, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever mixture there may be of Worldly, Wicked, and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in it. The other, That if God nouriſhes and preſerves his truly Faithful in our Communion, we are the True Church of God, that which has a Right to be in a Society, and to which all the other Rights that follow that of a Society belong, of Aſſemblies, Miniſtry, Sacraments, Government, Diſcipline, and by Conſequence we are the Church which ſucceeds not only <hi>de Jure,</hi> but <hi>de Facto,</hi> the Church of the Apoſtles, that of the Ages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and even that which was immediately before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Propoſitions are framed in clear and diſtinct Terms, they have neither Ambiguity, nor Equivocation, but I hold alſo that they are of a certain and indiſputable Truth. For there neither is, nor ever was there any other True Church then that of the Truly Faithful, and there never will be any other. The Holy Scripture ſets down no other, Reaſon will not ſuffer us to acknowledge any other. The Fathers never owned any other. This is the conſtant and evident Principle of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as may be ſeen in the Fourth Chapter of the Third Part, and it is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97749:236"/>
alſo the Principle of the other Fathers, as may be Juſtified by almoſt an infinite Number of paſſages. <hi>The Antient Catholick Church,</hi> ſays <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, is but one only Church, which</hi>

                  <hi>Saints, the Congregation of the Juſt.</hi> I do not deny, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſometimes give a very large extent to the Church, when they conſider it as mingled with almoſt an infinite number of the wicked, and the Worldly, as we have frequently explained it already, and it is to this <hi>Idea</hi> that they refer their compariſons of a Field, of the Air, and the reſt, which we have often mentioned. But it is certain, That when the Queſtion is to be decided, which of the two Parties that make up that mixed Body, is the Church, that they unanimouſly agree to give that Title to the truly Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and to the Righteous only, and that they deprive the wicked and the worldly of it; and it is for this Reaſon that Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. de Bapt. cont.

It is for the ſame Reaſon that he diſtinguiſhes between being <hi>in</hi> the Church, and being <hi>of</hi> the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97749:237"/>
Church, for he would, that although the wicked might be in the Church yet that nevertheleſs they were not of the Church; that they doe not belong to its Body, but that they are in its Body as ill humours that oppreſſed and diſturbed it; and it is to the Faithful alone, Excluſively to all others, that he aſcribes all the Rights of the Church, although the wicked may ſometimes have the diſpenſing them in quality of Miniſters and Paſtors; for he would in that Caſe, that thoſe might be inhabitants of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> who diſtributed that good which did not belong to them, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. in</hi> Pſal. 61.</note> but to the Truly Faithful only, the only Inhabitants of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is then a certain and manifeſt Truth, That the Truly Faithful only are the Church, and that to them alone belong all the Rights of the Church; but if we would here add another to it, which is not leſs certain, ſince it is founded upon the promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt, to wit, That there always has been a Church in the World; it would evidently follow, That if our Communion has the advantage of the True Faith and Worſhip over the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, in a word, if we have Reaſon at the Foundation, we are not only the True Church, but that we are ſo by a Juſt Succeſſion <hi>de jure</hi> and <hi>de facto</hi> to that Church which preceded us, and which even preceded us immediately before the Reformation. It is no more to be inquired after where it was, or which it was, for the promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt aſſures us, that he had one; his Scripture, Reaſon, the Fathers declare to us that it conſiſted wholly in the Truly Faithful. Put then theſe truly Faithful where you pleaſe, in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the Weſt, in the Eaſt, or in the <hi>Indies</hi> if you will, it is nothing to our Queſtion. If we are truly Faithful as they, we are their lawful Succeſſours in all the Rights of the Chriſtian Society. Whether we received the Faith from their hands, or whether we received it elſewhere, it matters not, we do not fail to be their true Heirs; for God, as Saint <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>may even of theſe Stones raiſe up Children unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> They are our Fathers by the Right of Age, but they are our Brethren alſo by the Unity of the ſame Faith, and one and the ſame Spirit that animates us, and makes us to be one Body with them: When they were in the World, in what condition ſoever they were, the Miniſtry was theirs, the Sacraments were theirs, the Right of Aſſemblies belonged to them, ſince thoſe things can only belong to the Faithful, and when God has ſent them to their reſt, that Myſtical Heritage could be raiſed by none but other true
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97749:238"/>
Believers, for ſuch is the Law of the Family of God, that it is neither fleſh, nor blood, nor Tranſmiſſion of Pulpits and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, that make a Succeſſion, but the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; or as <hi>Tertallian</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>the Conſanguinity of the Faith and Doctrine:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tertul. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. adverſ. Haeret.</hi> cap. 32.</note> If then we have that Spiritual Conſanguinity, we are their true Succeſſours, and we make but one only body, one Church with them.</p>
               <p>But they will ſay, How can it be that you ſhould make but one only Body with the Church which was before the Reformation, ſince that Church lived then in Communion with thoſe from whom you are now Separated? She had an Exterual Worſhip quite differing from yours, ſhe was under quite another Miniſtry then yours, for ſhe was under a Miniſtry that profeſſed to invocate Saints, religiouſly to Worſhip their Images and their Reliques, to Sacrifice really the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, to believe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, the Real Preſence and all the other Articles that you at this day profeſs to reject. How can you be the ſame Church? How can your Miniſters be Succeſſours to thoſe who were at that time Biſhops, Arch-Biſhops, Cardinals, Patriarchs, and Popes? Your Liturgies are different, your Diſcipline is not leſs, you have neither Feaſts, nor Proceſſions, nor any of the Solemnities practiſed openly among us; how can it be otherwiſe then that you ſhould be a new Church?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Firſt, That if that Reaſoning were Juſt, it would conclude that the Church before the Reformation, was not the ſame Church with that which the Apoſtles eſtabliſhed at firſt, for according to the <hi>Idea</hi> that the Holy Scripture gives us of the Apoſtolick Church, we cannot ſee there any thing like to that which was done immediately before the Reformation. We find there neither the ſame Tenets, nor the ſame Worſhip, nor the ſame Solemnities, nor the ſame form of Miniſtry, nor the ſame Government, nor the ſame Diſcipline, nor the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor the ſame Liturgies, nor in fine any thing of that which our Fathers reformed: Let them tell us then after what manner they mean that the Church before the Reformation was not the one and the ſame Church with that of the Apoſtles. For if they were in effect two different Churches, and that we were obliged to chuſe one to have Communion with, or an Identity with, as they ſpeak, we ſhould not heſitate upon the choice. We ſhould have a thouſand times more Conſolation and Aſſurance to find our ſelves conformed to the Apoſtolick Church, then to be in nothing different from that which immediately preceded the Reformation;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97749:238"/>
ſince the Apoſtolick ought to be lookt on as the Mother Church the Original, Exemplar, or Pattern to all the Ages following, from which it is not allowable to recede. Let the Author of the Prejudices then if he pleaſes do one of theſe two things, either ſhew us in the Church of the Apoſtles all thoſe things which we have not in Conformity with the Church that was immediately before the Reformation, and upon which ground he would have us be a new Church, let him ſhew us that there was Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation there, the Real preſence, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the Adoration of the Euchariſt, the Worſhipping of Images, the Invocation of Saints, the Worſhipping of Reliques, the Orders and vows of their Religious, the Caelibacy of Church-men, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in an unknown Tongue, Their Feaſts, Proceſſions, and in general all that, that according to him made us a new Church, differing from that which preceded the Reformation, or if he will not engage himſelf ſo far, let him at leaſt tell us after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he underſtands that the Church before the Reformation was not it ſelf a new Church differing from that which the Apoſtles eſtabliſhed. He cannot tell how to do the firſt of thoſe things becauſe it is abſolutely impoſſible, and he can never do the ſecond, becauſe his principles wholly oppoſe it, and in effect it is true, that thoſe who believed and practiſed all that which I have noted were not one and the ſame Church with that of the Apoſtles. If then he can do neither the one nor the other, he ought to look to it, how he means that his Church ſhould be the True Church of Jeſus Chriſt, for it is enough as to us, to find our ſelves confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Church of the Apoſtles, ſince that being, as we are certain that it is, the ſame Body that God has Eſtabliſhed upon Earth, to which Jeſus Chriſt has promiſed a perpetual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and without which we ſhould very difficultly know pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely how he has Executed his promiſe, we ſhould no ways doubt that we were the ſame Church which has ſubſiſted even down to the Time of the Reformation. For when we ſhould be ignorant of the manner how it has ſubſiſted, when we ſhould not be able to underſtand that, we ſhould be notwithſtanding certain, that it has ſubſiſted, ſince the word of Jeſus Chriſt is inviolable, and none can call it in queſtion without impiety, whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that we are not a new Church, but the ſame which has always abode, and which was immediately before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:97749:239"/>
That way which we hold to aſſure our ſelves of this Truth is not only good, ſolid, and certain, but it is yet further the only one that any Communion can or ought to hold, if it would be certain with a good Conſcience that it was the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt which has always ſubſiſted, and which will always ſubſiſt, I would ſay, it ought to compare it ſelf with the Church of the Apoſtles to know whether it be conformable to that, and as to what reſpects the following Ages, it ought to reſt aſſured upon the word of Jeſus Chriſt who has ſaid that he will be with his until the end of the World, for that certainty ariſes from thence, that being one with the Church of the Apoſtles, it is alſo one with that of all the Ages following. But if he will take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and ſay that Communion is the ſame with the Church of the fifteenth or ſixteenth Age, therefore it is the ſame with that of the Apoſtles, becauſe that Jeſus Chriſt has promiſed that his Church ſhall always ſubſiſt, it is evidently to expoſe himſelf to Error and Illuſion, and to follow a very falſe and deceitful way of Reaſoning; The Reaſon is evident, becauſe by this means one is liable to take that for the Church in the 15 or 16 Age which it may be is not ſo. For in that viſible Body which they call the Church mixed, there are two Parties, the one which is properly the Church, and the other which is not, the one which is the Wheat that the Son of God has ſown, and the other which is the Tares ſown by the hand of the Enemy, the one which is the good ſeed, and the other which is the chaff. But it may ſo fall out that the Tares ſhould exceed the Wheat, and that a heap of chaff ſhould cover the good ſeed, and by conſequence the conformity which they pretend to have with that Church, might be nothing elſe but a conformity with the Chaff and the Tares, and not with the Wheat which would be the greateſt of all Illuſions. But if they took the former way, they would be in no danger of falling into that Error, becauſe we know that in the Church of the Apoſtles the Wheat ſurmounted the Tares, the good grain the Chaff, and that that which appeared to their Eyes was of Jeſus Chriſt, and not of the wicked one, whence it follows that they could not be deceived in taking one Unity for another. This then is the way that we hold, and which by the Grace of God gives us great peace of Conſcience, thoſe who follow the other ought to take heed that they go not from it.</p>
               <p>See here my firſt Anſwer, the ſecond is, That that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the Eſſence of the Church, never ought to be confounded
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97749:239"/>
with that which regards only its Condition. The Church as I have ſo often already ſaid conſiſts only in the truly Juſt and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and not in that confuſed heap of the worldly who Aſſemble with them under the ſame Miniſtry, and who partake of the ſame Sacraments. That therefore which makes the Eſſence of the Church, is the True Faith, Piety, and Charity, and it is moſt true that thoſe Vertues cannot be without the true Doctrine, diſintangled from all thoſe Errors which ſeparate us from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of one only God, and the Mediation of one only Jeſus Chriſt. Whence it follows, That the True and pure Doctrine is the Eſſence of the Church. But it is alſo true, that while the Foundation of the True Doctrine remains in a Communion, and there is yet left there ſome liberty to the Minds and Conſciences of men, for the choice of the Objects of the Faith, and Practice of the Actions of Religion, how impure ſoever that Communion may be, whatſoever Errors may be Taught there, whatſoever falſe Worſhip they may practiſe there, how corrupted ſoever the Publick Miniſtry may be, there is always a means there to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the good from the bad, and to ſecure one's ſelf from this in holding to the other, without falling into Hypocriſy, or acting againſt the Dictates of ones Conſcience by falſe ſhews. But I affirm this to be the Condition of that Viſible Communion that we call the Latin Church immediately before the Reformation. I acknowledge that Tranſubſtantiation was believed there, the Real preſence, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the merit of good Works, Purgatory, human Satisfactions, Indulgences, the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that they religiouſly Worſhipped the Images of God there, and thoſe of the Saints, that in thoſe days they gave a Religious Worſhip to Reliques, that they adored the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt there as being the very perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, that they then Invocated the Saints, and in a Word that they then believed and practiſed all that which they now believe and practiſe in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the foundation of Chriſtianity was as yet there, and we may truly ſay, that in that good which there was there, they had light enough to reject that which was bad. That Commandment alone, Thou ſhalt Worſhip one only God was enough to let a good Soul know that he ought not to adore either Saints or Angels, or to call upon them, or render any Religious Worſhip to their Images and Reliques, nor to take any Creature for the Object of this Devotion. The Doctrine of the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt upon the Croſs, and that of his ſitting on the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97749:240"/>
Right hand of God was ſufficient to make them reject thoſe of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the Real preſence, Tranſubſtantiation, the Adoration of the Hoſt, Haman Satisfactions, Indulgences and Purgatory. For it is true that the Religion then was compoſed of two contradictory Parties that overthrew one another, thoſe who took things on the wrong ſide deſtroyed the good by the bad, for in adoring, for Example, the Saints and Angels they overthrew that good Doctrine, Thou ſhalt worſhip one only God: in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and Tranſubſtantiation, they annihilated in effect, the Sacrifice of the Croſs, and they removed as much as in them lay Jeſus Chriſt from the Right hand of his Father. But thoſe who took things in a good ſence deſtroyed on the contrary the evil by the good: for in adoring one only God, they taught others not to pay any Religious Worſhip to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; in placing their confidence in the Death of Jeſus Chriſt for their ſakes, they taught Learned to reject the Sacrifice of the Maſs, all humane Satisfactions; and in ſeriouſly believing that Jeſus Chriſt was in Heaven, they were diſ-abuſed about his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral preſence on the Altars. In fine, they could each in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular very well do, what our Fathers did altogether when they Reformed themſelves, for their Reformation wrought nothing but what the ſame Doctrine, which they had, Taught them. One only God and one only Jeſus Chriſt made them reject all that they rejected. Beſides it is certain that the greateſt part of thoſe things which we believe contrary to the true Faith, were then Taught and received and practiſed in the Latin Church more by force of Cuſtom, then any publick Authority, that could impoſe any neceſſity on mens Conſciences even according to the principles of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day which leaves private men liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough to reject them. And when they ſhould come to be even publickly determined with all the neceſſary formalities, which they have not been yet, there would always remain to every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man a natural right to examine and reject them, ſince the Authority of Men, how great ſoever it be, can never bind the Conſciences of the Faithful. We do not therefore Queſtion but that God has always preſerved under that Miniſtry, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons who have made that Separation of the good from the ill, and it is in thoſe that the Church may ſubſiſt. But beſides thoſe, how many ſimple people were there, whoſe own ſimplicity and ignorance hid them from thoſe Errors that then reigned in the Miniſtry. They knew enough to believe in one only God the Father
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97749:240"/>
Son and Holy Ghoſt, their Creator and Father, and in one only Jeſus Chriſt their Redeemer, Born Crucified, and raiſed again for them, and to practice without Superſtition all the Actions of Chriſtian Piety that thoſe Doctrines inſpired into them; but they did not know enough to believe the Sacrifice of the Maſs, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, the real preſence, humane Satisfactions, the merit of good Works, and a multitude of other things that did not enter into them. Their knowledge was bounded with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they received with all the ſubmiſſion of their hearts, and which they laboured to practiſe the beſt that they could, and we ought not to doubt that that knowledge alone, plain and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſintangled from all Error, which they had, furniſhed them with a ſufficient direction for their Salvation without their being bound to make a more expreſs rejecting of thoſe Doctrines they did not underſtand. But ſuppoſing that they had a knowledge of them, I ſay that we ought carefully to diſtinguiſh two ſorts of Times, the one in which the falſeneſs of a Doctrine or Worſhip is not ſo palpable diſcovered, and open to mens Eyes, that their ſhould be only a voluntary blindneſs or an ill Prejudice that ſhould hinder us from acknowledging and underſtanding how that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and that Worſhip are contrary to the True Faith and Piety, and the other in which that falſeneſs and contrariety are ſo openly or publickly manifeſted, that one cannot be ignorant of them or not ſee them without ſhutting voluntarily ones Eyes. For in the ſecond of thoſe Times, every one is bound, for the integrity of his Faith and Religion and the preſervation of his Soul, earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and publickly to reject thoſe Errors, to avoid them with an averſion, to withdraw from thoſe Aſſemblies where they are either taught or practiſed, and not to take part, how little ſoever, or if any do they have no excuſe for their crime, and this is the Time wherein we are at this day. But as to the former, it is enough not to be corrupted with them, without any abſolute neceſſity of teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publickly that ſtrong averſion. In the ſecond Time, they ought to look on thoſe kinds of things as they are in Effect, becauſe they are fully diſcovered, and they may be ſeen in all that have them to be oppoſite to the glory of God and Salvation of men. But that Obligation can never be ſo ſtrong in the firſt Time becauſe there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one has neither the ſame light, nor the ſame helps, nor the ſame eaſineſs to own them to be ſuch as they are: not only meer natural Light dictates this Diſtinction, but Jeſus Chriſt himſelf has very

                  <hi>ſpoken unto them, they had not had Sin, but now they have no Cloak for their Sin,</hi> which evidently eſtabliſhes thoſe two ſeaſons, I ſpoke of, the one wherein the Manifeſtation of good and evil is not yet ſo throughly made, that one can acknowledge them in their greateſt Latitude, and the other wherein it is ſo that one cannot without a crime know it confuſedly. But I ſay that before the Reformation they were in that firſt Time in regard of that which we call the Errors and Superſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were neither ſo well Examined, nor ſo clearly diſcovered, as they have been ſince, the Faithful then could not openly believe and practiſe them, for that could not be done according to us in any Time without deſtroying the true Faith and Piety, but they could look upon them with a greater indifference, bear them with far leſs Pain, nor ceaſe for all that from frequenting their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, from holding their peace, and contenting themſelves with keeping their own Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>See here after what manner we believe that the Eſſence of the Church was preſerved before the Reformation. How corrupted ſoever the Miniſtry was, the Foundation of Chriſtianity remained there, and God had yet his remnant there according to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Grace, that is to ſay his Truly Faithful. It was thoſe alone in all that great mixt body, who were the Church, for they only were in Communion with God and his Son, they alone enjoyed the benefits of the Goſpel Covenant; to them only, how ſmall a number ſoever they were pertained all the Rights and advantages of the Church of the External Society, of Aſſemblies, of the Miniſtry, of the Holy Scriptures, of the Sacraments, Government and Diſcipline according to the inviolable Maxim of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> All things are yours, whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or the World, or Life or Death, or things preſent or things to come, all are yours, and ye are Chriſts and Chriſt is Gods. All the reſt then which were without in that mixed Body which they Call the Latin Church and which had any Relation to that Religion, was not of the Eſſence of the Church, but its State, the mixture of Errors and Abuſes with the ſound Doctrine, the Corruptions of Worſhip, the Vices of the Miniſtry, the Superſtitious Ceremonies, the form of Government, the Religious as they ſpeak, that is to ſay, the divers Orders of <hi>Monks,</hi> the different degrees of the Hierarchy, Feaſts, Proceſſions, Faſts; and in a Word all that which has been noted in the Objection, and in which that Church was then different from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97749:241"/>
the Proteſtant, All that I ſay belonged to the condition of the Church then, and could by conſequence be changed without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king either the one or the other a new Church. That the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful found themſelves inſenſibly overpowred by almoſt an infinite number of the Worldly who mingled themſelves with them, <hi>as Tares with the Wheat,</hi> That thoſe worldly made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Pulpits, the Miniſtry, the Councils, that they brought in Errors, Superſtitions, and Abuſes, that they changed the form of the Government of the Church, and that of the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, all that does not reſpect the Eſſence of the Church, which conſiſts only in the True Faith, but its Condition, ſo that when our Fathers Reformed thoſe things, we may well ſay they Changed the State of the Church in their days, but not that they changed the Church, nor that they made a new one, and their Church will not ceaſe notwithſtanding that Change to be joyned by a true Succeſſion of Times and Perſons to that which was before. A Town full of Strangers who make themſelves more powerful there, left deſolate by thoſe popular diſeaſes which thoſe Strangers brought thither, and filled with thoſe diſorders which they cauſed does not ceaſe to be the ſame Town by a True Succeſſion of Times and Perſons, when thoſe Strangers ſhould quit it, and its good Citizens be eſtabliſhed in their Juſt and Lawful State, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rome</hi> ſackt by the <hi>Goths,</hi> did not ceaſe to be the ſame <hi>Rome,</hi> when it was freed from them, and a River ſwelling with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the neighbouring Brooks, that make it overflow the Fields and break over its Banks, is yet the ſame River when thoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters go back, and retire into their Ordinary Channel.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Miniſtry Exerciſed in the Communion of the Proteſtants is Lawful, and that the Call of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters is ſo alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE come now to Juſtify the Right that we have to the Goſpel-Miniſtry, and to defend our Call not only againſt the Ordinary Objections of thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but alſo againſt the Accuſations of the Author of the Prejudices in Particular. For that Author who thinks it merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to go beyond others eſpecially in his Paſſions, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented meerly to ſay, that we are <hi>Paſtors without Miſſion and Miniſters without a Call,</hi> but by a heat of Zeal obſtinately adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, he call us <hi>Thieves and Robbers, Tyrants, Rebells, falſe Paſtors, and Sacrilegious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers of the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Nevertheleſs, as thoſe injuries are nothing elſe but the Effect of his ill humour, it will be no hard matter to ſhew him, that all the Conditions that we can rationally require to make a Miniſtry Juſt and Lawful, are to be found in that of the Proteſtant Miniſters, and that Thanks be to God they can reproach them with nothing on that occaſion. This is that which I deſign to ſhew in this Chapter, and to this Effect I ſhall firſt propound ſome Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations which I Judge neceſſary for the unfolding of that Queſtion.</p>
               <p>I ſay then in the Firſt place, That we do not here diſpute about the Call that our Fathers had for a Reformation, but only of that which they had, and which we have after them for the Ordinary Miniſtry of the Goſpel. For we ought to take great heed leaſt we confound as the Author of the Prejudices has done, thoſe two ſorts of Calls that we acknowledge our Fathers to have had, and which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> diſputes with them. For, That which they had to Reform themſelves, that is to ſay, to reject that which we call their Errors and Superſtitions that were brought into the Latin Church, and that which regards the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Preaching of the word of the Goſpel, the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and the Exerciſe of Diſcipline. Theſe two
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97749:242"/>
Calls are wholly different. The one, which is that of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, is of Right common to all Chriſtians, there being no one who is not Lawfully called by his Baptiſm, to deſtroy Errors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Nature or Purity of the true Faith, and to exhort his Neighbours to do the ſame thing, for the Intereſt of his own Salvation, and that of the Glory of God, as I have already ſhewn in my Second part. From whence it follows, That in that Reſpect they can have nothing to ſay againſt our Fathers, and much leſs <note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> againſt thoſe whom they call the firſt Reformers, ſince being as they were, in publick Offices, they had more of a Call for that then was neceſſary. The other, which is that which reſpects the Ordinary Preaching of the Word of the Goſpel, the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments, and the exerciſe of Diſcipline, is not common to every private man. On the contrary, no one ought on his own head to thruſt himſelf in without being otherwiſe Lawfully called. The Reaſon of this Difference is, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation conſiſted in the meer Acts of Faith and Charity, which are thoſe Particular Acts that none can diſpence with, becauſe no one can ſay that it does not belong to him to be of the true Faith, or to be Charitable; but the Preaching of the Word, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacraments, and the exerciſe of Diſcipline, are thoſe Acts of Authority that no one can do in his own name, but in the name of another, that is to ſay, in the Name of God, or in the Name of the whole Church, ſo that he ought to be Lawfully Authoriz'd to do them. It is then this latter Call that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about in this Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Second place we muſt note, that we do not here any more diſpute about that Extraordinary Miniſtry which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf immediately Communicated to his Apoſtles to give men the firſt Call to the Chriſtian Faith, and to Aſſemble them in a Society. For our Fathers did not make any new Convocation, nor any new Society, nor any new Church, as I have ſhewn in the Two Foregoing Chapters. They did not preach a new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or a new Covenant differing from that which the Apoſtles preached. They were not qualified either as new Apoſtles, or new Prophets, or new Evangeliſts; they did not bring with them any new Revelation to the World, but they Purged and Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Corrupted State of Religion and the Church, by the ſame Scriptures that the Apoſtles left us; they laboured to Reduce things into their Antient and Natural State, and for the reſt, they Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame Gopel and Adminiſtred the ſame Sacraments that the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97749:243"/>
Apoſtles left, and which had alwayes Subſiſted, notwithſtanding the Corruptions wherein they were plunged. In a word, they did not ſet up any thing new, for which they can with any Colour of Reaſon require an immediate Miſſion either from God, or Jeſus Chriſt his Son. We ſpeak therefore here only of the ſame Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Miniſtry that the Apoſtles eſtabliſhed in the Chriſtian Church, as they called or formed it, and which was there appointed, to help its Preſervation and Purgation. This is that Miniſtry which we do not pretend to have a new, but that Antient and perpetual one which Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles left to the Church when they were Converted to the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the Third Place, we muſt know that to Judge well of the Validity or Invalidity of a Miniſtry, we ought to Conſider it in three Reſpects: 1. In Reſpect of the things themſelves that are taught and practiſed in it. 2. In Reſpect of the Body, that is to ſay, the Society where it is exerciſed. 3. In Reſpect of the Perſons who exerciſe it in that Society. In Regard of the firſt, the Miniſtry of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Pagans,</hi> the <hi>Mahometans</hi> is Wicked and Sacrilegious, becauſe the things that are taught there are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious. In the Second, the Miniſtry of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferians,</hi> which was good and Chriſtian in it ſelf, becauſe there was taught and practiſed nothing ill in it, yet it was notwithſtanding Vitious, becauſe it was exerciſed in Schiſmatical Societies, which had no right to have a Miniſtry apart, and to live in aState of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For the Third, the Miniſtry of an Intruder, an Uſurper, a Simoniack, howſoever good it be in it ſelf, however it be ſet up in a Lawfull Society, that is to ſay, in the true Church, yet it is notwithſtanding bad and Unlawfull, through the Defect of his Perſonal Call.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the Fourth Place, we muſt here before we go any further, make Uſe of the ſame Diſtinction, upon this Subject of the Miniſtry, that we have uſed in the Preceding Chapter upon the Subject of the Church, I mean, that we ought to place a great Difference between that which makes the Eſſence of the Miniſtry, and that which belongs only to its State. For that which is Eſſential to the Goſpel Miniſtry cannot be changed ſo as to make another Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and by Conſequence a Falſe, Sacrilegious, and Criminal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, ſince there can be but one alone, good and Lawful; and on the contrary, the Eſſence of a Miniſtry remaining the ſame and Intire, it muſt needs be ſaid that it is the ſame Miniſtry, though as to what Reſpects its State it ſhould have received a Change. The Eſſence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97749:243"/>
of the Goſpel Miniſtry Conſiſts in the teaching the ſaving Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Truth, without excluding any Article that is neceſſary to the Subſiſtance of the True Faith, Piety and Holineſs, in diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the true Sacraments that Jeſus Chriſt has Eſtabliſhed in his Church, and in guiding the People in ſuch a manner as helps to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Religious Society, or which at leaſt does not abſolutely deſtroy it. Its State is either good or bad; the Good State is then when there is ſuch a Purity in the Miniſtry that only Chriſtian Truths are taught there, and wherein thoſe are taught in all their Force and Natural Beauty with all the Diligence and Care that men aſſiſted by the Grace of God are capable of, and when the Sacraments alſo are purely adminiſtred according to the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt without Addition or Diminution, and with all the Decency, Modeſty, Simplicity, Gravity, Circumſpection, that thoſe Myſteries of the Chriſtian Religion require, ſo that God may be Glorified, and his Kingdom more and more eſtabliſhed in the Hearts of men, and when further the Church is Governed by Juſt, Wiſe, Prudent, Charitable and well Executed Laws, after a way that does not deſtroy but Edify. In Fine, that Good Conſiſts alſo in this, that thoſe who Exerciſe this Miniſtry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it by Juſt and Lawful waies, that are proper to draw the Bleſſing of God upon them and their Labours, and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves worthily, quitting themſelves with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the Charge Committed to them. The bad Eſtate of the Church, on the contrary, is then when that Miniſtry is found to be mingled with Errours and Superſtitions, when the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Altered and Corrupted, when the Government of it is worldly, or unjuſt, or Tyrannical, or Confuſed, when thoſe who fill up that Miniſtry, take it by ill, ſcandalous, and unlawfull wayes, and behave themſelves unworthily in it. The Good State of the Miniſtry is a thing that is the moſt to be wiſhed for in the World, and moſt proper to preſerve the Faith, Piety, Holineſs, Peace, Comfort, and Publick Rejoicing in the Church; and the bad State is the moſt to be feared of any thing in the World, and that which we ought to Labour the moſt to Remedy. Nevertheleſs we are not to think that the Miniſtry may not yet Subſiſt in that bad State, as our Bodily Life does not ceaſe to Subſiſt in the midſt of Languiſhing, and heaps of Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the fifth place, we ought Carefully to diſtinguiſh the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry conſidered preciſely in it ſelf, and the ſame Miniſtry in as much as it is Occupied or poſſeſſed by perſons who are Inveſted
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97749:244"/>
in it, or if you will, we ought to diſtinguiſh the Miniſtry and the Miniſters, for there is a very great Difference between the one and the other; as in a civil Society there is a great difference between the Magiſtracy and the Magiſtrate; The Magiſtracy is an Office, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is a Perſon who poſſeſſes that Office, the Office remains all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, the perſons are changed by Death or otherwiſe. This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is not hard to be conceived, but it is nevertheleſs of very great Uſe in the Matter we are upon. For the Miniſtry Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in its ſelf is of an immediatly Divine Eſtabliſhment; Whereas the Perſons that are raiſed to it, are raiſed thither by means of men, and if their Call be divine, as it is in Effect, it is no otherwiſe then mediately ſo; for they are men who call them to it, although they do it by the Authority of God. It is then certain that when God has eſtabliſhed the Miniſtry, he has not only eſtabliſhed all that which it ought to have Eſſential to it, but he has alſo Eſtabliſhed it, <hi>de Jure</hi> and <hi>de facto</hi> in a good State; I mean, he has not only laid an Obligation upon Miniſters faithfully to diſcharge all the Functions of ſo great a Charge, but that he has even choſen Perſons who have moſt faithfully acquitted themſelves of it. But it has not been alwayes the ſame in thoſe who have been called by men, for as humane Judgments are ſo ſhort-ſighted, that they cannot pierce through the Hearts of men, and as they are mixed with a great many Imperfections, the Miniſtry may be Committed to perſons who are Inſenſibly Corrupted, either through their Ignorance or through other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations yet more Criminal then Ignorance, and it is from that humane Intervention that the bad State of the Miniſtry proceeds. If God would alwayes ſend them immediately, as he did his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Evangeliſts, there would be ſome ground to believe, that it would never be remote from its firſt Inſtitution; but ſince they are men that ſend them, no one can deny, that it cannot be Corrupted through that Channel, for God has never promiſed any thing to the contrary in that matter. God has not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he would accompany thoſe Elections and Humane Calls with an Infallible Spirit, that ſhould give them all a happy Succeſs; and beſides that the experience of all the Ages paſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts it, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſeems purpoſely to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden ſuch a raſh Imagination; for although he knew the Heart, and the thoughts of it, yet nevertheleſs he would have a <hi>Judas</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Number of his firſt Diſciples, and he permitted that a <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who was afterwards the Head of the Sect of the <hi>Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:97749:244"/>
ſhould have a part in the Election that the Church made of her firſt Deacons, to give us to underſtand that it was not his intention actually to hinder the Miniſtry from ever falling into very bad hands.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We muſt note in the ſixth place, That although the Church and the Ordinary Miniſtry which we ſpeak of, are two things natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally joyned together,—yet it is not the Church that depend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s upon the Miniſtry, but it is the Miniſtry on the contrary that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Church. For the Ordinary Paſtors were not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed but when the Church was firſt formed, and when care was taken for its Preſervation and Propagation, ſo that naturally it preceded Paſtors. The Church was produc'd at firſt by the Extraordinary Miniſtry of the Apoſtles; the firſt thing which they propounded was not to make Ordinary Paſtors, but true Beleivers. They called men to the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, they aſſembled them together, they united them in a Society, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they provided for the upholding of that Society in ſetting up an Ordinary Miniſtry in the midſt of it. They firſt took care for the birth of the New Creature, and after they procured it Breaſts to nouriſh it: Therefore it is that the Ordinary Miniſters were called Paſtors, in reference to Shepheards who fed and led their Flocks. They were called Presbyters or Elders, with reference to the Senators among the <hi>Jews;</hi> they were called Biſhops, that is Overſeers, or Super-Intendants, by an Alluſion to the Super-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of Victuals among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were called Biſhops alſo. But the Shepheards ſuppoſe their Flocks, the Choſen Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators among the people ſuppoſe the people, the Super-Intendants or Overſeers ſuppoſe thoſe over whom they gave a right of Super-Intendance and Inſpection. The Ordinary Miniſters therefore ſuppoſe the Church, and not the Church the Miniſters; ſhe is not, becauſe they are, but they on the contrary becauſe ſhe is; ſhe does not own her being to them, but they theirs to her. This Truth will yet appear more clearly, if we ſet before their eyes, what I have already ſaid in the firſt Chapter of this Fourth Part, That the Ordinary Miniſtry is not abſolutely neceſſary to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Church, but that it is only neceſſary to its well being, and to hinder it from falling into Ruine. For when the Faithful ſhould have no Paſtors, they would yet be joyned together in a Society, ſince it is Grace and Faith that unite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s them, and not the Miniſtry. And as in the Civil Society it is the Nature and not the Magiſtrate that unites men, and that after men are united in a Society, the Magiſtrate is made, by reaſon of Order, and by the neceſſity of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97749:245"/>
the preſervation of that Society; ſo that it is the Society that makes the Magiſtrate, and not the Magiſtrate the Society: So here it is the ſame; The Faith and Grace Aſſemble men into a Religous Society, they are thoſe things that make the Church, and afterward the Miniſtry ariſes by reaſon of Order, and to help the preſervation of the Church, and ſo naturally it is the Church that produces the Ordinary Miniſtry, and not the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Miniſtry that produces the Church. The Church was the Fruit of the Extraordinary Miniſtry of the Apoſtles and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, that Miniſtry produc'd it at firſt, and not only produc'd it, but it has always ſince made uſe of that means or that ſource for its ſubſiſtence; and we may truly ſay that it yet produces it, and that it will produce it unto the end of the World, for it is the Faith that makes and alwayes will make the Church; and it is the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles which makes and will always make the Faith. It is their voice that calls Chriſtians together at this day, it is their word that Aſſembles them, and their Teaching that unites them. It is certain that the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles was ſingular, that is to ſay, only tyed to their perſons without ſucceſſion, without Communication, without Propagation; but it ought not to be thought that it was alſo as Tranſitory a Miniſtry as that of other men, for it is perpetual in the Church; Death has not ſhut their Mouths as it has the others, they ſpeak, they inſtruct, they inceſſantly ſpread abroad the Faith, Piety and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs among the Souls of Chriſtians; and there is not another Fountain from whence thoſe Vertues can deſcend, but from them. If any demand of us what is that perpetual Voice that we aſcribe to them? We anſwer, That it is the Doctrine of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where they have ſet down all the Efficacy of their Miniſtry, and the whole vertue of that Word which gave a Being to the Church. There it is that their True Chair and their Apoſtolick See is, there is the Center of the Chriſtian Unity, there it is that they inceſſantly call men, and join them into a Society; every other Voice beſides theirs is falſe and ſuppoſititious, it is from theirs alone that the Church proceeds; and becauſe to Aſſemble with thoſe is to Aſſemble with Jeſus Chriſt, we may very well ſay, that not to Aſſemble with them, is to diſperſe inſtead of Aſſembling. But as to the Ordinary Miniſtry of the Paſtors, we cannot ſay the ſame thing, it is not their Voice, as it is diſtinct from that of the Apoſtles, that begets the Faith, that Aſſembles Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Society, or that produces the Church; they are no more but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97749:245"/>
meer diſpenſers of the Word of the Apoſtles, or if you will, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Inſtruments to make us the better underſtand their Voice. They are not, not only, the Ordinary Paſtors who gave a Being to the Church at firſt, but yet further at this day to ſpeak proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is not their word that produces the Faith in thoſe who had it not before; for that which confirms it in thoſe who have it, and that which produces it in thoſe who have it not, is the word of the Apoſtles themſelves, to whom we muſt go for conduct, if we would have good ſucceſs. They are then to ſpeak properly no more than thoſe External Guides that God has Eſtabliſhed in the Church to lead men to the Scripture, and even ſuch Guides as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder us from going thither of our ſelves if we will, and it is the Scripture, the voice of the Apoſtles, or to ſay better the voice of Jeſus Chriſt, that ſpeaks by the Apoſtles, that does all. There is therefore a great difference between thoſe two ſorts of Miniſters, the one preceded the Church, the other follows it; the one is immediately Communicated by God, and the other is Communicated by means of men; the one has an Independent and Soveraign Authority and Infallibility on its ſide, and the other is expoſed to Vices, Diſorders, Errours and humane weakneſſes; Inferior, and depending on the Church; the one is every way Divine, and the other is partly Divine and partly Humane.</p>
               <p n="7">7. From that ſixth Obſervation there ariſes another not leſs important, and that which I have already touched upon in divers places of this Treatiſe, that is, That the Ordinary Miniſtry is a Right that belongs to the True Church, and of which it can never be ſpoiled. The Reaſon of this Truth is taken from the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Church. For the Church being a Society that God has call'd together by the Miniſtry of his Apoſtles, and which he yet every day calls together and upholds by the word of his Scriptures, and the uſe of his Sacraments, we muſt neceſſarily ſay that in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it, he has given it in that very thing that he has formed it a ſufficient, full and entire Right to make uſe of all the means that may help its preſervation and upholding, amongſt which that of the Miniſtry is without doubt moſt conſiderable. That ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that gives men a Natural Life, and appoints them to preſerve their life by that Food it furniſhes them with, gives them by that very thing a right to employ perſons to gather that food together and to prepare it, to the end they may make uſe of it according to what it is deſigned for; and it would be a great Extravagance to demand of a man what Right he has to prepare
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97749:246"/>
himſelf to eat and drink, for he could have nothing more to ſay but that the Nature that gave him life, gave him at the ſame time all the Right that was neceſſary, to provide for the upholding of that life. And, to make uſe of another Example, The ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to ſay better the ſame Providence, that Aſſembles men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Civil Society, and ordains them in their ſo uniting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to uphold that Society by a rational Order, does it not give them at the very ſame time and by the ſame Right that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles them, a Right to have Magiſtrates, to Govern them by, and to make the Laws of that Society to be Executed, to have Judges to decide their differences, to have Remedies for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Diſeaſes, and Tradesmen for the publick good: And would it not be an abſurdity to demand of a people what Right they had to have Magiſtrates, Judges, Phyſicians, Tradeſmen, Teachers of Commerce, Lawyers, ſince they could not have a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and juſter Right than that which is founded upon the reaſon of Order and the Society it ſelf? We need but to apply theſe Examples to the Subject we are upon. The Church is a Body to which God has given a Spiritual Life, and he has ordained it to be preſerved and upheld in the uſe of Myſtical Aliments, of which he himſelf has made a publick Magazine in his Holy Scriptures; it is therefore evident that he has given it by that very thing, a Right to have Miniſters or Paſtors who ſhould prepare thoſe Sacred Aliments, and ſeaſon them for its Spiritual Nouriſhment. The Church is a Religious Society compoſed of divers perſons that God himſelf has Aſſembled to live together, not in Confuſion but in Order, he would have that Society ſubſiſt, he has appointed it to uphold and preſerve it ſelf, he himſelf has ſuggeſted the means; he has then without doubt by that very thing given a Right to have Guides to Govern her, Paſtors to lead them forth into the Heavenly Paſtures of the Scriptures, Miniſters to diſpenſe the Divine Sacraments that he has inſtituted for her, Watch-men and Guides to be careful of her, and to go before her. In a word he who has given Faith, Piety and Chriſtian Holineſs to the Church, has at the ſame time indiſpenſably obliged them to theſe four Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; one is, to perſevere in the Exerciſe of thoſe Vertues unto the end. The other is, to defend themſelves againſt the Aſſaults and wiles of the Enemy of their Salvation; the third is, to increaſe and ſtrengthen themſelves more and more; and laſtly, to propagate them as much as in them lyes from us down to our Children, and even amongſt Strangers, that is to ſay, among thoſe who are not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97749:246"/>
as yet in that Relation. It follows therefore neceſſarily that that has given the Church a ſufficient full and entire Right for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, ſince the Miniſtry is but a fit and lawful means for all that.</p>
               <p>It could not have a Right more lawful than that which is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon thoſe indiſpenſable Duties, for in that caſe, it is not only a Right that makes the thing juſt, but it is an obligation that impoſes a neceſſity of it; as in the State, the Right that every one has to learn the Will of the Prince is indiſputable, becauſe it is built upon the obligation that lies upon every one to conform himſelf to it. It is clear then that there could not have been a Right to have Miniſters more lawful than that of a Faithful People, a True Church, ſince it is founded upon thoſe four Duties which I have noted, that are indiſpenſable, and that give not only a Right but an Obligation to have a Miniſtry. But we ought here to take notice of the Fallacy that their Miſſionaries are wont to make, and that the Authour of the Prejudices who has Adopted their Method would have us make with them. For ſee after what manner they argue. Where there is no lawful Miniſtry, there is no True Church: But among the Proteſtants there is no True Church. I ſet aſide the Queſtion, Whether we have or whether we have not a lawful Miniſtry in the ſame ſence that he intends, I will only at preſent conſider his way of Reaſoning, that makes the True Church depend upon a lawful Miniſtry. Admitting that to be a True Church where the Miniſtry is, and denying that to be a True Church where the Miniſtry is not. I ſay that this is a vain, deceitful and illuſory way of Reaſoning; to which I oppoſe this other Argument: Where there is the True Church, there is a Right to a Lawful Miniſtry; But the True Church is among the Proteſtants; Therefore the Right to a Lawful Miniſtry is among the Proteſtants. Of thoſe two ways of arguing it is certain that this latter is the juſteſt and almoſt only juſt, right and natural. For the True Church naturally goes before the Miniſtry; it does not depend upon the Miniſtry, but the Miniſtry on the contrary depends upon it: as in the Civil Society, the Magiſtracy depends upon the Society, and not the Society upon the Magiſtracy: In the Civil Society the firſt thing that muſt be thought on, is, that Nature made men; afterwards we conceive that ſhe Aſſembled and United them together; and laſtly that from that Union that could not ſubſiſt without Order, Maſtiſtracy proceeded. It is the ſame thing in a Religious Society; the firſt thing that Grace did, was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97749:247"/>
to produce Faith in the Hearts of men; after having made them believe, ſhe United them, and form'd a mutual Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and becauſe their Communion ought not to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Order and without Government, from thence the Miniſtry aroſe. So that a Lawful Miniſtry is after the True Church, and depending upon it. It is not a Lawful Miniſtry that makes it to be the True Church, for it is ſo by the Truth of its Faith, and it would yet be ſo, when it actually had not any Miniſters; but it is the True Church that makes the Miniſtry to be Lawful, ſince it is from the Truth of a Church, that the Juſtice of its Miniſtry proceeds. The Argument therefore of the Author of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices involves the Diſpute in a ridiculous Circle, for when he would prove that we are not the True Church becauſe we have not a Lawful Miniſtry, we maintain on the contrary, That we have a Lawful Miniſtry, becauſe we are the True Church. And he cannot ſay that we are the cauſe of the ridiculous Circle, becauſe our way of Reaſoning follows the Order of Nature, and his does not follow it. I omit that his firſt Propoſition, which is, Where there is no Lawful Miniſtry there is no True Church, is Equivocal. For either he underſtands by that Lawful Miniſtry, Miniſters actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eſtabliſhed, or elſe he means a Right to Eſtabliſh them. If the former, his Propoſition is falſe, for the True Church may be without having actually any Miniſters, that is no ways impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as I have already ſhewn. And if he means the latter, his Propoſition is not to his purpoſe, for it would maintain that the Society of the Proteſtants has a full and entire Right to ſet up Miniſters for its Government, ſuppoſing that it had the True Faith, as it may appear by what I have ſaid, and as it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear yet more clearly by the following Obſervation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I ſay then in the eighth place, That the Body of the Church, that is to ſay, Properly and Chiefly the Society of the truly Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, not only has the Right of the Miniſtry, but that it is alſo that Body that makes a Call Lawful of perſons to that Office. This Truth will be confirmed by what I have already ſhewn, without any further need of new Proofs. But as the Queſtion concerning the true Fountain whence that Call proceeds, is it ſelf alone almoſt all the difference that is between the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and us about this matter, and that moreover it is extreamly Important to the Subject we are upon, It is neceſſary for us to examine it a little more carefully. They cannot then take it ill that I inſiſt a little more largely upon this Obſervation then I have done upon the reſt.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97749:247"/>
To make it as clear as I can poſſibly, I propoſe to Treat of three Queſtions; The firſt ſhall be, To know whether naturally a Call belongs to the Paſtors only, excluding the Laity, or whether it belongs to the whole Body of the Church. The Second, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in caſe it belongs to the whole Body of the Church, it can be ſaid that the Church can of it ſelf ſpoil it ſelf of its right, or whether it has loſt it any way that it could be ſuppoſed to have. And the Third, Whether the Body of the Church may confer Calls immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by it ſelf, or whether the Church is alwayes bound to confer them by means of its Paſtors?</p>
               <p>As to the firſt of theſe Queſtions, All the Difficulty it can have, comes only from the falſe <hi>Idea</hi> of a Call that is ordinarily formed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For firſt, They make it a Sacrament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, and they name it the Sacrament of Orders. From whence the thought readily ariſes that the Body of the People can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not confer a Sacrament. They Imagine next, That that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment impreſſes a certain Character, which they call an <hi>Indelible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> and which they conceive of as a Phyſical Quality, or an Abſolute Accident, as they ſpeak in the School, and as an Inherent Accident in the Soul of the Miniſter. They perſwade themſelves further that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles left that Sacrament and that Phyſical Quality in truſt in the hands of the Biſhops to be communicated by none but them. With that they mix a great many Ceremonies, and External Marks, as Unction, and the Shaving which they call the Prieſty Crown. They add to all that, Prieſtly Habits, the Stole, the Alb, the Cope, the Croſs, the Miter, the Rochet, Hood, Pall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They make My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Allegories upon theſe Ceremonies and thoſe Ornaments, they diſtinguiſh thoſe Dignities into divers Orders, they frame a Hierarchy ſet out by the Pompous Titles of Prelats, Primates, Arch-Biſhops, Patriarchs, Cardinals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They write great Books upon all theſe things, and the half of their Divinity is taken up in explaining their Rights, Authority, Priviledges, Immunities, Apoſtolick Grants, Exceptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What ground is here that all good men ſhould not believe that the Church-men, are at leaſt men of another kind from all others, and that they are no wayes made of the ſame blood, of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that God has made all Mankind? Notwithſtanding when we examine well that Call, what it is, to form a juſt <hi>Idea</hi> of it, we ſhall find that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly it is but a Relation that reſults from the Agreement of three Wills, to wit, that of God, that of the Church, and that of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97749:248"/>
Perſon called; for the conſent of theſe three make all the Eſſence of that Call, and the other things that may be added to it, as Examination, Election, Ordination, are Preambulatory Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Signs, and External Ceremonies, which more reſpect the Manner of that Call then the Call it ſelf. In Effect, in a Call we can remark but three Intereſts that can engage one to it, that of God, ſince he that is called ought to ſpeak and Act in his Name, that of the Church, that ought to be Inſtructed, Served, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; and that of him who is called, who ought to fulfil the Functions of his Charge, and to Conſecrate his Watchful Diligence, Cares, and Labours to it; from whence it follows, That that Call is ſufficiently formed, when God, the Church, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon called, come to agree, and we cannot rationally conceive any thing elſe in it. But as to the Will of the called, it does not fall into the Queſtion, for we all acknowledge that no one can be forced to receive the Office of the Miniſtry; and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribing the qualities of a Biſhop, begins with the deſire to be a Biſhop; <hi>If any man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Deſire the Office of a Biſhop, he Deſireth a good Work.</hi> We are only then concerned about the two others, to wit, that of God, and that of the Church. As for the Will of the Church, they cannot methinks deny, that naturally it ſhould not be that of the whole Body, and not meerly that of the Paſtors that ought to be required to it. For they are not the Paſtors alone who have an Intereſt in the call of a man, it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the whole Body of the Church, it is that which ought to be as I have ſaid, Inſtructed, Served and Governed, it is that that ought to receive the Sacraments from his hands who is called, and that ought to be Comforted and Edified by his Word. Its conſent therefore is neceſſary there, and it is of the Eſſence of the Call that it ſhould intervene. As to the Will of God, both the one and the other of us agree, that it is not any more not made known to men immediately and expreſly, for howſoever we may without doubt referr it to a particular Diſpenſation of his Providence, the qualities, or as they ſpeak, the Extraordinary Talents that ſome perſons have for the exerciſe of that Office, and eſpecially when thoſe Talents are joyned with internal Diſpoſitions, ſecret motions or deſires to employ them in God's Work, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his Glory, we affirm that that cannot be enough ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to conclude a Divine Revelation. God has therefore on this occaſion put his Will as a Truſt into mens hands, and that very thing, that he has Inſtituted the Ordinary Miniſtry in the Church,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97749:248"/>
contains a Promiſe to Authoriſe thoſe lawful Calls that they ſhall give to perſons for that Office. We are agreed upon that Point, it concerns us only to know who are left in Truſt with that Will, the Paſtors alone, or the whole Body of the Church. Thoſe of the Roman Communion pretend the former, and we pretend the latter.</p>
               <p>To decide this difference, I ſay, That we cannot rationally own any other to be left in truſt with the Will of God in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, then the Body to which he himſelf has naturally given the Right of the Miniſtry, for whoſe ſake he has Inſtituted the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and which he has even bound by an indiſpenſable Duty to have Miniſters. That Body I ſay, which has as great an Intereſt in it as that of the Preſervation of its Faith, Piety, and Juſtice, and whoſe conſent ought moreover neceſſarily to Intervene. But that Body is that of the whole Church, and not of the Paſtors only, it is to that, as I have ſhewn before, that the Miniſtry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, it is for the ſake of that that God has eſtabliſhed it, it is Indiſpenſably bound to have Miniſters, it has the greateſt Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts in it, and it ought even naturally to concur. It is that therefore that God has left his Will in Truſt with, as to thoſe Calls, and by Conſequence it is from that that thoſe Calls ought to proceed, and it would be Abſurd to make them flow from any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>We have already frequently ſaid, That the Body of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, as it is upon Earth, is alwayes mingled with the good and bad, with the true Believers, and the Wicked, and that when theſe two Orders of perſons are ſet in Oppoſition, they are the truly Faithful only, that are properly the Church of Jeſus Chriſt; That Church I ſay, which he has appointed to Aſſemble in his Name, to which he has promiſed his Preſence, to which he has given the Keys of his Kingdom, the Power of Binding and Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in a word, to which he has given the Miniſtry and all the Rights that follow upon it, or go before it; ſo that to be of that Church, it is neceſſary to be a True Believer, and no Body without True Faith can have that Advantage, the Prophane and the Wicked, as juſt, being all naturally Excluded. But it is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Paſtors may not be of the Number of thoſe true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; Experience juſtifies that the greateſt Number may forſake the true Faith; and there is no promiſe of God that that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happen in Reſpect of all of them. It would then be a great Raſhneſs to make thoſe Paſtors alone Depoſitaries of that Will
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97749:249"/>
of God whereof we ſpeak, and which is eſſentially neceſſary to the Call of Perſons, ſince not having any Revelation that promiſes that he will alwayes preſerve the Faithful in their Body, none can be aſſured that ſince the firſt riſe of the Goſpel till this preſent time they have alwayes been, none can be aſſured that it never hapned or that it will never fall out, that that Order may not be wholly fill'd up with, and poſſeſs'd by the worldly and Hypocrites. It would be to depoſite the Will of God in a Body that might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not be the true Church, and not have the leaſt part in its Intereſts, it would be to derive that Call from a Source that might be wholly cut off from the Church. It would be to make the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the Sacraments, that are a chief means of the Preſervation and Propagation of the City of God to depend on the Inhabitants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays, is alwayes mixed with the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which would be manifeſtly contrary to the Order of Gods Wiſdom. It is therefore without doubt more conformable to that Wiſdom, to make his Will known, and by Conſequence the Lawful Call of a man, throughout the whole Body of the Church, ſince that howſoever mixed the wicked may be there with the righteous in the ſame External Profeſſion we are notwithſtanding aſſured by the promiſes of God that there will be alwayes ſome true Believers in that External Profeſſion, even until the end of the World, and by Conſequence there will be alwayes the True Church, that very ſame that Jeſus Chriſt has Aſſembled, and to which he has properly given as well the Right of the Miniſtry as all the other Rights of a Religious Society. It is far more juſt, that ſince God has not more immediately by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf declared his Will, upon the occaſion of thoſe perſonal Calls, that we ſhould regard that Body which we are certain of that God loves and looks upon as his Family, and as the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, that we look upon it, I ſay, as his Interpreter in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, then to go to ſeek for his Voice, and as I may ſo ſay his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, in a Body whereof we cannot have the ſame certainty that it cannot be, or that it has not even ſometimes been wholly made up of the unjuſt and worldly.</p>
               <p>They will ſay it may be, that it would not be better if thoſe Calls ſhould proceed from the Body of the Church, although they might be certain that God alwayes preſerves the truly Faithful there; ſince the wicked moſt frequently prevail there over the Good, that they would make themſelves Maſters of thoſe Calls, and that they could neither more nor leſs Communicate them to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97749:249"/>
and the worldly, then if there were no Believers in the Church. I Anſwer, That it is true, that whether thoſe Calls come from the Paſtors only, or whether they proceed from the Body of the Church, we could have no certainty that they ſhould be well made as to the choice of Perſons, for God has not promiſed his Faithful Ones even when they ſhall be a greater number then the worldly, that they ſhall alwayes make good Elections, they may without doubt be deceived in that reſpect, although there may be a greater Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hood that thoſe Elections ſhould be more juſt, when they ſhould be made by a Body in which one is aſſured that there are allwayes True Believers, then when they ſhould be made by a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Body whereof one cannot have the ſame Aſſurance. But not to ſtay upon that, I ſay that my Argument Reſpects not the goodneſs of that Election, but the Validity of the Call in it ſelf whether it be conferred upon a good man, or whether on a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the Call of a wicked man ought not to ceaſe to be good, although the Choice ſhould be illmade. My meaning then is, that if the Call proceed only from the Body of the Paſtors, without the conſent of the whole Church Intervening, after whatſoever man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it may be ſo brought about, as that it may proceed from a Body of impious and Prophane Perſons, who ſhould all be really Separated from the Church, and who would have no part in its Intereſts; ſo that it would be to make the Divine Authority that ought to accompany that Call, and the Validity of the Actions of the Miniſtry, to depend on a Body of wicked men, and to make the Enemies of God the fit Depoſitaries of his Will, which to me ſeems no wayes conformable to the Order of his Wiſdom, eſpecially when there is another Body where we know that he alwayes preſerves and upholds his Faithful.</p>
               <p>But they will ſay yet further, If your arguing took place, it would take away from the Paſtors all the Functions of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry to give them to the Body of the Church. The Paſtors would have no more any Right, either to Preach, or to Adminiſter the Sacraments, or to Govern the Church, or to cenſure, or to ſuſpend, or to Excommunicate. For it we ſay that that Call would not depend upon them, under a pretence that we have not any Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that God preſerves and will alwayes Preſerve True Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers amongſt them, we muſt ſay the ſame, that the Government of the Church, Preaching, the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and the Exerciſe of Diſcipline could not be committed to them, ſince we have not any more Certainty for thoſe things, that there
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97749:250"/>
ſhould be any truly Faithful among them, then we have upon the matter of that Call; ſo that all muſt be overthrown if that Reaſon take place. I anſwer, That the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> heretofore fell into that Extravagance to imagine that the Preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the Sacraments, and the other Actual Functions of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ought to be performed by Holy Paſtors, to become good and valid, and not by the Wicked; ſo that being moreover Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with this thought, that the whole Body of thoſe Paſtors who retained Communion with <hi>Caecilianus</hi> were fallen off from their Righteouſneſs and become Wicked, they held that there was not any more a Church in the World beſides the Party of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus.</hi> But Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſhew'd them that their Principle was falſe; and it is worthy the noting by what Way he made them ſee the falſneſs of their Opinion, for it was neither by telling them that the Body of the Paſtors when they all became Wicked failed not to be the Church of Jeſus Chriſt, nor in holding that Jeſus Chriſt having at firſt put the Miniſtry into the hands of the Paſtors, it muſt neceſſarily follow by that very thing, that he was bound to preſerve their Righteouſneſs, or at leaſt alwayes to preſerve the truly juſt and Faithful Perſons in their Body, and thoſe who ſhould make the Sacraments to all the reſt. He ſays nothing of all that, but he had recourſe to the Body of the Church, and he ſays, that the Sacraments are not the Paſtors, nor the Power of the Keys, nor that of Binding and Looſing, nor any of the Functions of their Miniſtry, but that all that belongs to the Church; that it is that that Baptiſes when the Paſtors Baptiſe, that it is that that binds when the Paſtors bind, and that looſes when they looſe; and that it is to her that Jeſus Chriſt has given all thoſe Rights. But what will you ſay he underſtands by that Church? The Truly Faithful, whatſoever they be, the Wheat of God, the good Seed, the good Fiſh, as they are called; in a word, the Juſt, the Children of God, in Excluſion of the Worldly. It is from that Fountain that the Validity of the Sacraments is drawn, and the other Functions of the Miniſtry, and not from the Body of the Paſtors. I ſay then, the ſame thing. All that which the Body of the Paſtors does, it does in the name of the Church, and by Conſequence in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt is in the Name of the Church, it is the Church that preaches by them, that adminiſter the Sacraments by them, that governs by them, that cenſures, that ſuſpends, that abſolves, that Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates by them, they are only its Miniſters and the Diſpenſers
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97749:250"/>
of its rights. Whether then they be wicked, whether they be Prophane or Impious, that hurts their own Perſons, but it does not hurt their Functions, becauſe their Functions are not their own, but the Churches.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that Hypotheſis of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concerning the ſource from whence the Validity of the Action of the Miniſtry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, furniſhes us with another Argument which to me ſeems Demonſtrative not only from the Authority of that Father, but from the Nature of the thing it ſelf. For it is evident that we ought to refer that Call to the ſame Body to which God originally gave the Power of the Keys, and which is exerciſed by the Paſtors, ſo that the Paſtors are no more but the Diſpenſers of its Rights. As that which makes Baptiſm, the Communion, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Acts of Diſcipline good and valid, is not becauſe they proceed from the Paſtors only, but becauſe they proceed from the Body of the Church. So the ſame muſt be ſaid, that, that which makes a Call good, valid, and lawful, is, becauſe it comes from the Church, that is to ſay, from the truly Faithful. But it is certain that it is properly the Body of the Faithful that has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Originally the Power of the Keys, that is exerciſed by the Paſtors, and upon which the Validity of all the Actions of the Miniſtry depends, as being done in the Name and Authority of the whole Body, and by Conſequence it is to that we muſt refer that Call.</p>
               <p>If I had a mind here to ſet down all the paſſages of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> when he eſtabliſhes this Truth, I ſhould engage my ſelf in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Tediouſneſs. It ſhall ſuffice to ſet down ſome few that may clearly let us ſee what his Doctrine was upon this matter. <hi>Judas</hi> ſays he, <hi>Repreſented the Body of the wicked, and Saint Peter repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Body of the good, the Body of the Church; I ſay The Body of the</hi>

But becauſe in that very way in which they walk they are not free from thoſe Sins that ariſe through the Infirmity of this Life, he has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the ſaving Remedy of Alms, to help their prayers which he has commanded them to make; Forgive our Treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that Treſpaſs againſt us.</hi> After, I ſay, having deſcribed the Church of the Juſt in that manner, he adds, <hi>This is that which makes the Church bleſſed in Hope in this miſerable life, and it is this Church that Saint</hi> Peter <hi>repreſented by the primacy of his Apoſtleſhip,</hi> Nam Eccleſiae gerebat figurata generalitate perſonam. <hi>If you look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Saint</hi> Peter <hi>in himſelf, he was but a man by Nature, a Chriſtian by Grace, and the first of the Apoſtles by the ſuper-abundance of Grace. But when Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to him, I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on Earth ſhall be looſed in Heaven, he Repreſented the whole Body of the Church, that Church I ſay which in that Age was moved with divers Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as by ſo many Storms, Torrents and Tempeſts, and which yet does not fall into ruine, becauſe it is founded upon the Rock, from which Saint</hi> Peter <hi>took his Name. I ſay that Saint</hi> Peter <hi>took his Name from it, for as the Name of Chriſtian is derived from Chriſt, and not that of Chriſt from that of Chriſtian, ſo that of Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>is derived from the Rock, and not that of the Rock from the Name of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and therefore Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to him, Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church. For Saint</hi> Peter <hi>having made this Confeſſion, Thou art the Chriſt the Son of the living God, our Lord told him that he would build his Church upon that Rock which he had confeſſed. For that Rock was Jeſus Chriſt, upon which Saint</hi> Peter <hi>himſelf is built, according to what is ſaid, No man can lay other Foundation then what is already laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt. It is that Church therefore that was founded upon Jeſus Chriſt which received</hi>

One ſort are ſo much in the Houſe of God, that they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that Houſe that is built upon a Rock, and that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the only Dove, the Spouſe without Spot and Wrinkle, the Incloſed Garden, the hidden Fountain, the Wells of Living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Paradiſe where the Fruit of Apples is. It is this Houſe which has received the Keys and the Power to bind and looſe, and it is this to which he ſaid, That if any would not hearken to it when it Reproved and Corrected, that he ſhould be eſteemed <hi>as a Heathen man and a Publican—That Houſe conſiſts in Veſſels of Gold and Silver, in Precious Stones and Incorruptible Wood, and it is to that that Saint</hi> Paul ſays, <hi>Bear with one another in love, keeping the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace; and again, The Temple of God is Holy, which Temple ye are. It Conſiſts in the good, in the Faithful, in the Holy Servants of God ſpread abroad every where, joyned together in a ſpiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity by the Communion of the ſame Sacraments, whether they know one another by ſight, or whether they do not. But as for the others, they are ſo in the Houſe as not at all to belong to the Structure of the Houſe, and they are not in that Society that is Fruitful in Peace and Righteouſneſs. They are as the Chaff amidſt the good Corn, and we cannot deny that they are in the Houſe, ſince the Apoſtle ſays that there are in the Houſe not only Veſſels of Gold and Silver, but Veſſels alſo of Wood and Earth, the one to Honour and the others to Diſhonour.</hi> They muſt wilfully ſhut their Eyes that will not acknowledge by theſe Paſſages that it is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97749:252"/>
only to the Church of the Faithful, and not to the Body of the Prelates that that Father refers all the Efficacy and Force of the Actions of the Miniſtry, and all the Power of the Keys. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if you will, he explains himſelf yet more expreſly in the ſame Book out of which I have taken theſe laſt Words. <hi>Hitherto,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have methinks clearly enough demonſtrated by the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and by the Teſtimony of Saint</hi> Cyprian, <hi>that the Wicked who have</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. de Bap. contr. Donat</hi> lib. 6. cap. 3, &amp; 4.</note> 
                  <hi>undergone no change in their Natural Eſtate, may both give and receive Baptiſm. Notwithſtanding it is manifeſt that thoſe men do not belong to the Church of God, ſince they are Covetous, Extortioners, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers, Envious, Malicious, and Enſlaved by ſuch</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">* Raviſeurs</note> 
                  <hi>like Vices, for the Church is the only Dove that is modeſt and Chaſt; the Spouſe without Spot and Wrinkle, the Incloſed Garden, the Sealed Fountain, the Paradice full of Fruits, and ſuch other Titles that are given it can be underſtood of none but the Good, the Saints, and the Righteous; that is to ſay, thoſe in whom not only the Operations of the Gifts of God are found, that are common to the good and bad, but who have alſo the inward and Supernatural Grace of the Holy Spirit. It is to thoſe that it is ſaid, Whoſoevers Sins you ſhall remit, they ſhall be remitted; and whoſoever Sins you retain they ſhall be retained. I do not then ſee why we may not ſay that a wicked man may Adminiſter Baptiſm, ſince he may have it, and as he has it to his ruine, he may give it to others alſo to their ruine, not becauſe that that which he gives may be a Pernicious thing, but becauſe that he himſelf who receives it is a wicked man. For when a wicked man gives Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to a good man who dwelling in the bond of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is truly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the wickedneſs of him who gives it is overcome by the goodneſs of the Sacrament and the Faith of him who receives it, and when his Sins are pardoned who is truly Converted to God, they are pardoned to him by thoſe with whom he is joyned by a true Converſion. For the ſame Holy Spirit which was given to the Saints with whom he is united by the bond of Love, is he who pardons them, whether he knows that Body, or whether he knows it not. And ſo when the Sins of any are retained, they are retained by thoſe from whom they are ſeparated by the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their Lives and the Malice of their Hearts, whether they know that Body or whether they do not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It could not methinks be ſaid either with greater ſtrength or Clearneſs, that all the Efficacy of the Actions of the Miniſtry that the Paſtors Exerciſe, depends not on the Body of the Paſtors, but on the Body of the truly Faithful, and that in Effect they are thoſe who pardon and retain Sins when the Miniſters pardon or retain them. From whence it neceſſarily follows, That if the ſame Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97749:252"/>
of the Miniſtry belong to the Society of the Faithful, the Call of the Miniſtry, does ſo alſo with a far greater Reaſon; for if the Power of the Keys, the right of Remitting and Retaining Sins, belongs to the body of the Faithful only, it muſt be every way neceſſary that the Paſtors ſhould hold the exerciſe of that Power, from the body of the Faithful; for if they ſhould not hold it from thence, they would have no Right to exerciſe it, nor could have it elſewhere. And if they ſhould have it elſewhere or that it ſhould belong properly to the body of the Paſtors excluſively from the Simple Faithful, it would be not only not true, but it would be further abſurd to ſay that the body of the Faithful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed that Power by the Paſtors, or that they pardoned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Sins, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teaches.</p>
               <p>I cannot avoid taking notice here, by the by, of that Ordinary Error whereinto thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> fall, who do not believe that immediate, abſolute and Independent Authority that the <hi>Pope</hi> aſcribes to himſelf over the whole Church, but who would that the Power of the Keys is given to the whole Body of the Hierarchy, that is to ſay, to thoſe Paſtors who are Prieſts and Biſhops. For to prove their Opinion they do not fail to ſet the Sentiment of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> before us, which plainly, as we have ſeen, ſhews us that the Keys were given to the whole Church; from whence they draw two Concluſions, The one againſt that great Authority that the Pope pretends to, and the other for the Authority of the Biſhops, which they would have to flow imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Jeſus Chriſt. But of theſe two Concluſions it is certain that the Firſt is juſt and wholly conforming with the thoughts of that Father, but it is not leſs certain that the ſecond is not; and that, at leaſt without going about to deceive our ſelves willingly, or to cheat the World, we could not ſay, that That Church figured by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to which God gave the Power of the Keys, which is exerciſed by the Miniſtry of the Paſtors, ſhould be any other according to Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> then the Body of the Truly Faithful and Righteous, in oppoſition to the Worldly and the wicked who are mixed with them in the ſame External Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and this is in my Judgment ſo clear and evident in the Doctrine of that Father, that they muſt needs be ignorant of it who deny it. It is therefore a manifeſt Illuſion to go about to make uſe of thoſe Paſſages in favour of the Biſhops, for that Church is not the Body of the Hierarchy, but that of the Truly Faithful, whether they be Laymen, or Paſtors, and it is to thoſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97749:253"/>
only that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> aſcribes all the Rights and all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Miniſtry, as it may appear by what I have related, and by conſequence it is to thoſe that the lawful Call of the Paſtors belongs, and not to the Body or Order of the Hierarchy. For it would be abſurd to derive that Call from any thing elſe, then from that very Church which has received the Power of the Keys, and which is exerciſed in her Name and her Authority by her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. <hi>Toſta us</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Abyla,</hi> ſeems to have acknowledged this Truth conformably to the Principles of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> for ſee <note place="margin">Toſtat Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens in Numer cap. 15. queſt. 48. &amp; 49.</note> after what manner he explains himſelf in his Commentaries upon <hi>Numbers,</hi> upon the ſtory of the man who was brought before the whole Aſſembly of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe ſome had found him gathering of Sticks upon the Sabbath Day and put him in Priſon for it. Firſt of all he ſays, <hi>That although the Acts of Juriſdiction cannot be exerciſed by the whole Community, yet that Juriſdiction belongs to the whole Community in regard of its Origine and Efficacy, becauſe the Magiſtrates receive their Juriſdiction from it.</hi> He adds afterwards, <hi>That it is the ſame in the Keys of the Church, that Jeſus Chriſt gave them to the whole Church in the perſon of Saint</hi> Peter. <hi>And that it is the Church that Communicates them to the Prelats, but which notwithſtanding Communicates them without depriving it ſelf of them, ſo that</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Church has them and the Prelats have them, but in a different manner; for the Church has them in reſpect of Origine and Vertue, and the Prelats have them only in reſpect of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe; The Church has them vertually, becauſe ſhe can give them to a Prelate by Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhe has them Originally alſo. For the Power of a Prelate does not take its origine from it ſelf, but from the Church, by means of the Eelction that it makes of him. The Church that choſe him gives him that Juriſdiction, but as for the Church it receives it from no Body after its having once received it from Jeſus Chriſt. The Church therefore has the Keys Originally and Virtually, and whenever ſhe gives them to a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, ſhe does not give them to him after the manner that ſhe has them, to wit Originally and Virtually, but ſhe gives them him only as to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this we may add, that ſome Councils of theſe latter Ages, as thoſe of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> ſeem to have acted themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Principle when they gave themſelves the Title of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the whole Univerſal Church. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalem Eccleſiam Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentans.</hi> For to what end did they take that ſpecious Title, if they would not acknowledge that the Origine of the Authority of the Prelats or the Paſtors, is in the Body of the whole Society,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97749:253"/>
and that it is from thence that it is tranſmitted to them to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it in the name of the whole Body?</p>
               <p>But that which is moſt conſiderable is, That it appears from the Teſtimony of the Holy Scripture, that the Body of the Church, that is to ſay, the faithful people, in oppoſition to the Paſtors, has taken part from the beginning in the Acts of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Government, and particularly in the Calls of Miniſters; which evidently notes, that it is a natural Right that belongs to it. For that when after the Apoſtacy and Tragical Death of <hi>Judas,</hi> they were to ſubſtitute another Apoſtle in his place, Jeſus Chriſt not having done it immediately by himſelf before his Aſcention, the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> relates, that the whole Church, which then only Conſiſted in an hundred and twenty Perſons, was Aſſembled, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 1. v. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and that upon the Propoſal that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> made to them, they appointed two, upon whom the Lot having been caſt, and falling upon <hi>Matthias,</hi> with a common conſent he was put into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Apoſtles. They were there about the Call of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, that is to ſay of a Miniſter who ought to come immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, and therefore it was that they caſt the Lot; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church was then formed, and that Jeſus Chriſt being no more corporally preſent upon Earth, thoſe Calls could not be made wholly and immediately by him, men took ſome part in them, for by their Election they limited the Lot to two perſons, and in the end declared by their acquieſence that they look'd upon the Declaration of the Lot, as if it had been the very voice of Jeſus Chriſt. This is all the part that men could take there, but it was not only the Apoſtles who did thoſe two things, it was the whole Body of the Church. The Hiſtory notes that the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was about an hundred and twenty perſons, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> made a Propoſal to them, that upon that Propoſal of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> they preſented Two, <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Matthias,</hi> and that the Lot falling upon <hi>Matthias,</hi> he was numbred with the Eleven A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by common Agreement, that is to ſay, by the common conſent of all. That evidently ſhews us, that the Body of the Faithful, and not meerly the Body of the Paſtors, is the Right ſource of Calls. The ſame things appear in the Call of the Seven Deacons, for the Story expreſly notes, that the murmuring of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Greeks</hi> againſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> falling out, and giving occaſion to the Apoſtles to think of that Call, they called the multitude of the Diſciples, and that when they had made a Propoſal to them, the Aſſembly approved of it, and that in the end they choſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97749:254"/>
perſons, whom they preſented to the Apoſtles, who after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving prayed to God, laid their hands on them. But that further lets us ſee from whence a Lawful Call proceeds, to wit, from the Body of the Faithful, and not meerly from the Body of the Paſtors, for it was the whole Aſſembly that approved of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the Apoſtles, and that choſe, and not the Apoſtles alone, who did nothing elſe but propoſe and lay their hands on them. This is further juſtified by the Practice of the Apoſtles, which would readily admit the people in the moſt weighty Affairs that reſpected the Government of the Church into their deliberations and Acts, when that might be done without Confuſion. So in the Firſt Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Queſtion being ventilated whether the Obſervation of the Ceremonies of the Law was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it is ſaid that it pleaſed the Apoſtles and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 16.</note> Elders or Presbyters (for it is the ſame thing) with the whole Church, to ſend to <hi>Antioch</hi> and write to the Church there. That Letter was in effect written in the name of all, and ſent to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, <hi>The Apoſtles and Elders and Brethren unto the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which are of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>in</hi> Antioch, <hi>and</hi> Cyria <hi>and</hi> Cilicia, and it is expreſlynoted that when <hi>Jude</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> who were the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of that Letter, were arrived at <hi>Antioch,</hi> they Aſſembled the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that is to ſay the people, and there acquitted themſelves of their Commiſſion; which diſtinctly ſhews that the people then took cognizance of the matters of Religion, and that they interven'd in publick Deliberations. So when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would Excommunicate the Inceſtuous perſon of <hi>Corinth,</hi> he calls the Church to that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>In the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when ye are gathered together, and my Spirit, let ſuch a man be delivered unto</hi> Satan <hi>for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the Deſtruction of the Fleſh, that the Body may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> which notes the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have read the writings of Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> cannot be ignorant that that great Saint governed his Church by the common Suffrages not only of his whole Clergy, but of all his people alſo, and that he conſulted with them in the moſt weighty Affairs, ſince he has declared it himſelf in divers places of his writings. <hi>I could not,</hi> ſaies he, in one of his Epiſtles to his Clergy, <hi>anſwer to that which our Brethren</hi> Donatus, Fortunatus, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt</hi> 6.</note> Novatus, <hi>and</hi> Gordius <hi>have wrote to me, becauſe I am alone, for from the firſt entrance into my Biſhoprick, I purpoſed to do nothing of my ſelf without your Counſel and the Conſent of my people. So that when the Favour of God ſhall have joyned me again to you, we</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:97749:254"/>
                  <hi>ſhall treat of all things in common according to what our mutual ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour requires of us.</hi> In his Tenth Epiſtle, he complains of ſome Prieſts who without ever conſulting others had received thoſe into Communion who in time of Perſecution had abjured Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and he order'd that they ſhould be deprived of their Funct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>for</hi> ſays he, <hi>they muſt give an account of their Actions before us and before the Confeſſors, and before all the people, when God ſhall give us the Favour to let us meet together again.</hi> In the Twelfth he writes to the People of his Church, <hi>Fratribus in plebe conſiſtentibus,</hi> he notes concerning thoſe who had fell in time of Perſecution, and who deſired ro be reſtored to the peace of the Church, <hi>That when God ſhould have ſent Peace again to his Flock, and that they ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain recover their Aſſemblies, that Affair ſhould be examined in the preſence of the people, and that they ſhould judge of it among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Tunc,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Examinabuntur ſingula preſentibus &amp; judican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus vobis.</hi> In the 28th Epiſtle, anſwering his Clergy who had conſulted together concerning ſome Prieſts who had abandoned their Flocks, <hi>I could not</hi> ſaies he, <hi>make my ſelf the ſole Judge of buſineſs. Which ought to be exactly managed, not only with my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues but with the whole Body of the people alſo, non tantum cum Collegis meis, ſed et cum plebe univerſa.</hi> In the 68th Epiſtle, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as well in his own name, as in the name of divers other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Affrica</hi> Aſſembled in Council to the Churches of <hi>Leon</hi> and <hi>Aſtorga,</hi> on the matter of <hi>Baſilides</hi> and <hi>Martial,</hi> Biſhops who had been depoſed for their Crimes: <hi>The People,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who obey the Commandments of the Lord, and who fear God, ought to ſeparate themſelves from a wicked Paſtor, and not to take any part in the Sacrifices of a Sacrilegious Prieſt. Since it is the people who have chiefly the power to Elect thoſe who are worthy, and to reject thoſe who are unworthy. The Divine Authority it ſelf has eſtabliſhed this Law, that the Prieſt ſhould be choſen in the Preſence of the People, before the eyes of all, to the end he ſhould be approved as worthy of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry by a publick Judgment and Teſtimony. Therefore it is that God ſaid to</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Book of</hi> Numbers, <hi>Thou ſhalt take</hi> Aaron <hi>thy Brother and his Son</hi> Eleazar, <hi>and thou ſhalt make them come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mountain in the preſence of all the Aſſembly, thou ſhalt take off</hi> Aarons <hi>Veſtment and put it upon</hi> Eleazar, <hi>for</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall dye there. He ordained that the Priest ſhould be eſtabliſhed in the preſence of the whole Aſſembly, to teach us that the Ordination of Prieſts ought not to be performed without the Knowledge of the people aſſiſting, to the end that in their preſence the Crimes of the wicked</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:97749:255"/>
                  <hi>and the Deſerts of the good ſhould be diſcovered, and that ſo the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination ſhould be good and lawful when it ſhould be examined by the Suffrages and Judgments of all. We find in the Book of the Acts that the ſame thing was practiced when they were to ordain another Biſhop in the place of</hi> Judas. Peter <hi>ſtood up in the midſt of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and all the Multitude Aſſembled together into one place. And that was obſerv'd not only in the Ordination of the Biſhops and Prieſts, but it was obſerv'd alſo in that of the Deacons, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the ſame Book of the Acts, where it is ſaid that the Twelve Apoſtles called together the whole multitude of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Therefore according to Divine Tradition, and the obſervation of the Apoſtles, that Order ought to be diligently preſerved and held, which is alſo obſerv'd among us, and almoſt in all Provinces, that in Order to the making of lawful Ordinations, the nearest Biſhops of a Province ſhould Aſſemble with the people, who ought to ordain a Prelate, and the Biſhop ſhould be choſen in the preſence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who may perfectly know the Life and Converſation of every one. And this is what was done amongſt you in the Ordination of</hi> Sabinus <hi>our Colleague, for by the Suffrages of all the Brethren, and by the Judgment of the Biſhops who came themſelves to you, after you had wrote, they conferred the Order of Epiſcopacy on him and laid their hands on him in the Room of</hi> Baſilides.</p>
               <p>See here the firſt Queſtion decided. The ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in knowing whether we can ſay with any Reaſon that altho' <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2.</note> thoſe Calls ought naturally to proceed from the whole Body of the Church, as we have juſt before ſhewn, yet that the Church has loſt that Right, and that it is now lawfully deprived of it. That which gives ground for this Difficulty is, that although in the Civil Society the Right of Creating of Magiſtrates ſeems naturally to belong to the whole Body of the Society; yet it fell out that the Order of Nature has been interrupted, for in Monarchical States it is not the people, but the Prince only that confers Offices, and that Right is ſo lawfully in him, that there is no Office that does not depend upon his Nomination. They may therefore pretend that the ſame thing falls out in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Society; from whence it will follow, That it is no more the whole Body of the Church that ought to confer thoſe Calls, but the Body of the Prelates, or if you will the Soveraign Monarch of the Church, who is as they pretend the Pope. But I maintain that that cannot be any ways ſaid. It is not ſo in reſpect of the Religious Society, as it is in that of the Civil.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97749:255"/>
In the Civil, the people may be lawfully deprived of the Right that Nature has given them to Create their Magiſtrates, and to provide for its Government, whether they be done by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Tranſmiſſion which they themſelves have made to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Family, or to a certain Perſon to whoſe Rule they ſubmit themſelves, or whether it come to paſs by a juſt Conqueſt. But theſe ways have no place in the Church, ſhe can neither create nor acknowledge a Soveraign Monarch, in whoſe favour ſhe ſhould deprive her ſelf of her Rights in that regard, to make him an Abſolute Maſter. For being concerned for her own Salvation, which ſhe finds intereſted in the Functions of the Miniſtry, and moreover having no aſſurance, as I have already noted, that he or thoſe in whoſe Favour ſhe ſhould ſtrip her ſelf of her Rights, ſhould themſelves be faithful, it would be viſibly to expoſe her ſelf, to give her ſelf over into the hands of the Palpably Prophane, the Unbelievers, or Hypocrites, to make her Enemies her Lords, and it would be palpably to hazard her Faith and Conſcience, which ſhe could never do without a Criminal negligence, of which ſhe never ought to incur the Guilt. In the Civil Society, where the matter is only about Intereſts, and not about thoſe that concern ones Salvation, nothing hinders but that a people may wholly reſign themſelves to the Cares of a Soveraign Power to Govern them, and it may be moſt frequently advantageous for them to do ſo alſo, to avoid the Evils that ariſe from the thwarting of divers private Intereſts, which may do a prejudice on the publick. But in the Church, or where ones Salvation is concern'd, the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful can never without a Crime deprive themſelves, to give it into the hands of another, of that Care that God has Commanded them to have over all the external means they may make uſe of for the procuring of that Salvation, for howſoever their Faith and Piety does not abſolutely depend upon their Paſtors, yet the Functions of the Miniſtry, when they are pure and Holy, are a great help to them for that, and the preſervation of their Faith becomes moſt difficult when the Miniſtry is corrupted. The Church therefore in that reſpect can never be lawfully ſpoiled of its Rights, and he who has given them to it, has not given it the power to quit them, nor to tranſport them to another. As to the way of Conqueſt, every one may ſee that has leſs place in the Church then that of Tranſmiſſion. For that which in the Civil Society makes the Dominion of a Conquerer to be juſt, is, that when he enters into a Society with the people which he has
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97749:256"/>
Conquerr'd, he is not bound to repent that he made War with them, nor to ſeek their Favour, or ask their Pardon; ſo that the Fruit of his Conqueſt remains with him, and without renouncing it, he may become the Friend of that People, that is to ſay, be their Lord and their Friend together. But it is otherwiſe in the Church, he who makes War againſt it, cannot enter into its So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to govern it, unleſs he repent of his having treated it as an Enemy, unleſs he Humble himſelf before it, unleſs he beg pardon of God for what he has done, &amp; by conſequence unleſs he renounce all the advantages which he could pretend to by the Right of Arms. If he does not do that, he can never enter into the Church, nor by Conſequence have any part in its Government; and if he does, he has no more Ground to ſay that the Church ſhould belong to him by Conqueſt. It is Evident therefore that the Body of the Faithful can never Lawfully either deprive it ſelf, or be deprived by another, of the Right that naturally belongs to it to provide for its Support, and its own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in calling Perſons to the Miniſtry: From whence it follows, That that Call, in order to its being juſt, ought to proceed from the Body of the Church, and that it ought not to proceed from any elſe.</p>
               <p>There remains therefore now, nothing but the third Queſtion which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Body of the Church be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3.</note> always bound to confer Calls by means of its Paſtors, or whether in ſome Caſe the Body of the Faithful Laity may not confer them immediately? To clear this point, we muſt plainly diſtinguiſh that Call in it ſelf, I would ſay into that which it has of Eſſential, and the way of its being Conferred, that is to ſay the Formalities practiſed in it. That which is Eſſential to it conſiſts in theſe three Conſents which I have noted, that of God, that of the Church, and that of the Perſon called. The way or manner of Conferring conſiſts on one ſide in ſome preambulatory Acts, without which that Call would be very Confuſed and Raſh, and theſe Acts are Inſtruction, Examination, Proof of Doctrine, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, of a good Life and a good Converſation in regard of manners, and on the other ſide in ſome Solemnities or External Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies that ſerve to render that Call more Publick, Majeſtick and more Authentical, as Faſting, Prayer, Exhortation, Benediction, and Impoſition of hands.</p>
               <p>As to the Eſſence of a Call, ſince as I have ſhewn, that in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97749:256"/>
the conſent of the perſon called, the will of God is found included in that of the whole Body of the Church, and that more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it appears that the ſimple Faithful, whom they Term Lay-men, do not ceaſe to be joyned in a lawful Society, and to make a Body of the Church although they ſhould have no Paſtors, it is evident that thoſe Faithful people are alone ſufficient to make Calls Lawful. When they have Paſtors, they ought immediately to concur with them, and to make Elections in Common, if it may be done without Confuſion, and if it cannot, they ought at leaſt to ratify by their Approbation the Elections that the Paſtors ſhall have made, and when they cannot have any without a viſible danger of diſperſion, it is certain that they may alone and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by themſelves confer that Call. For the Call proceeds from the Society, not in as much as it has Paſtors, but in as much as it is a Society, I would ſay, in as much as it is a Body of the Faithful United together in the Communion of Faith, Piety, and Juſtice. It is that Society that naturally makes its Order, it is naturally in as much as it is a Society, put in truſt with the will of God in that reſpect, and the Miſtreſs of its own Conſent. When then it ſhall have no Paſtors the Call it ſhall Communicate will not fail to be full, lawful and ſufficient, and to have all that which is eſſential to it. It is as certain alſo that the Paſtors in the True Church have not naturally any Right to concur to Calls, if they are not Faithful, ſince that if they are not Faithful they are really without that Society, and that the Right of Calls in the True Church can belong only to the Truly Faithful, and not to others. It ought not then to be doubted that a Faithful People alone, and abandoned of all its Miniſters, may make a Call.</p>
               <p>But they will ſay, How can it be that Lay-men ſhould make Eccleſiaſtical perſons, and confer a power and an Authority which they have not themſelves? I anſwer, That this Difficulty is null, for it is true, That no one can lawfully give away that which does not belong to him either <hi>de jure,</hi> or <hi>de facto;</hi> and it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true that the Office of the Miniſtry belongs neither <hi>de facto,</hi> nor <hi>de jure,</hi> to any private man, nor even to divers private men taken out from the Body. And therefore it is, that not only no private man can thruſt himſelf into the Miniſtry of his own head, but even that a part it ſelf of the Society cannot Lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Call, without the conſent of the other, though it have the greateſt number of its ſide. So that we may ſay with Reaſon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97749:257"/>
that there is the Body, in compariſon of the other party. But I ſay that the Miniſtry belongs to the whole Society, not that all the whole Body can Exerciſe immediately all the Acts of it, of it ſelf, but that no one Body can either Preach or Adminiſter the Sacraments, but only becauſe it is its Authority and its conſent which renders thoſe Acts valid, in vertue of the inſtitution that Jeſus Chriſt has made of that Religious Society with all its Rights. From whence it follows, that the Body of the Faithful, howſoever it be compoſed all of Lay-men, does not ceaſe to have the power Lawfully to confer the Miniſtry on a Man, without its being liable to be ſaid, that it confers that on others which it has not it felf; for it is certain that the Miniſtry belongs to it, and that a Call conſiſts but in depoſiting the publick Right into the hands of him who is called, to the end it may be reduced into Act in the Name of the whole Society. But I ſay, that the Faithful people themſelves have a Juſt and lawful Call, to give up that Truſt: For as I have noted already, there is no Call more Lawful then that which is founded not only upon a ſufficient Right, but upon a Duty alſo, and an indiſpenſable Obligation. When the matter is about Societies, there is nothing more abſurd then to imagin, that a whole Body cannot Communicate that which all the parts that compoſe it have not. For if it were ſo, a People could never make a King, which is yet notwithſtanding done in all Elective Kingdoms, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf cannot give a reaſon why ſhe makes her <hi>Popes,</hi> ſince there is not any <hi>Pope</hi> preſent who ſhould make his Succeſſours. They are all Created by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> who are not <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves, ſo that they give that which they have not. They muſt therefore needs ſay, That the Papacy is virtually in the Colledge of the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and that that which each one among them has not, they have all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Body, otherwiſe they could not Create a <hi>Pope</hi> with that fulneſs of Power, and that extent of Juriſdiction, which is not in meer Biſhops.</p>
               <p>As to what regards the manner of conferring thoſe Calls, they will agree with me that there are things there, that the Body of the People may and ought immediately to do by themſelves, as proof of the purity of Doctrine, Information of manners, Faſting and Prayer; and I will acknowledge that there are others there that ought not to be done but by the Paſtors only, when they have them, as Examination in reſpect of Knowledge, Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Publick Prayer, Benediction, and laying on of Hands. But
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97749:257"/>
in Caſes Extraordinary and of abſolute Neceſſity, the Church not having any Paſtors, and notbeing able to have any without a viſible danger of diſperſion, I ſay that they may and ought to appoint ſome perſons to do thoſe things in their Names. And thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ought not to think that which I propound ſtrange, ſeeing that they would readily in a Caſe of abſolute Neceſſity, have any ſimple Lay-men, or a ſimple Woman, have the power of Adminiſtring of Baptiſm: Baptiſm is a Sacrament, it is the publick introduction of a man into the Church of God, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to them, a Sacrament ſo great and auguſt, does not fail of being good and valid, though Adminiſtred by a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who has no particular Commiſſion from the Church, if the Church is eſteemed to Baptize by that Lay-man, how much more good and available ſhould the Prayer, Benediction, and laying on of hands, conferred in a Caſe of abſolute neceſſity by a Lay-man, be, ſince that not only it is not a Sacrament properly ſo called, but that further that Lay-man does not Act in that Solemnity in the quality of a meer private man, but as having received the Office and Commiſſion from the whole Body of the Faithful, the whole Body doing it by him, and Authoriſing it by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> has gone much further then we go upon this matter, For he would, that, where there there ſhould be no Paſtors, every Lay-man ſhould have the power, not only to Baptize, but alſo to Conſecrate the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and to Adminiſter it; and his words ſeem to be grounded upon the very ordinary practice of his Time. Where ſays he, there is no company of Church-men, you offer and Baptize, (he ſpeaks to the Lay-men) and you your ſelves are alone Prieſts to your ſelves. Where there are three perſons, if they ſhould be Lay-men, there is a Church there, for each man lives by his Faith, and God has no reſpect of perſons. I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to approve of that which he ſays concerning the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that he would have a ſimple Lay-men have the power of Celebrating when there ſhould be no Miniſter, and I acknowledge there is an exceſs in that Propoſition. But it may appear from thence at leaſt that the Right of Conſecrating a Paſtor in a Caſe of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity was not then denyed to the whole Body of the Church.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the General Obſervations that I had to make upon this matter. It will be now no hard thing to apply them to the Miniſtry of the Proteſtants, and the Perſonal Call of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97749:258"/>
to make a ſolid Judgment of it. Firſt, then, I ſay, that our Miniſtry conſidered in it ſelf, that is to ſay, with reſpect to the things which we Teach and Practiſe, cannot but be moſt Lawful. For we ſuppoſe here that our Doctrine is the very ſame that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles Taught, we add nothing to it, we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh nothing from it; the Sacraments that we diſpence are the very ſame that Jeſus Chriſt has inſtituted; and the Government that he has ſet up in the midſt of us, is not remote from that of the Primitive Church according to what it is repreſented to us in the Scripture. If the Author of the Prejudices has any thing to ſay to us upon that Subject, he ought to come to it by way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, and not by that of Preſcription. But before he forces us to give a Reaſon of our Miniſtry, he would do Juſtly if he would give us Satisfaction concerning his own, which he well knows we deſire; I would ſay, he would do Juſtly, if he would ſhew us what Call he himſelf had at firſt, by the Juſtification of the things that he Teaches: What Right he had to Teach Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, the Real Preſence, the Adoration of the Hoſt, the Worſhipping of Creatures, Humane Satisfactions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Really to Sacrifice the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. If he cannot make it appear that all thoſe things that are in Diſpute between the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and us, are Goſpel-Truths, he can neither prove his Call, nor hinder us from holding it null and unlawfull. For he cannot have any Lawful Call to Teach Errors, nor to perform thoſe Actions of Religion that Jeſus Chriſt never inſtituted, and by conſequence it is from that that he ought to begin, when he would inform us of the Truth of a Call. In Effect all other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries will ſignify nothing, if that does not go before; ſince Piety, Truth, Sound Doctrine, are the neceſſary Foundations to every Lawful Call; and that on the contrary, no Creature can have any Right either to Teach a Lye, or make the People practiſe, or to practiſe it ſelf, a Worſhip contrary to the true ſervice of God, or to celebrate the Sacraments that Jeſus Chriſt has not inſtituted. It belongs therefore to the Author of the Prejudices to tell us how he pretends to avoid that Diſcuſſion, for it is certain that the firſt Queſtion that muſt be decided to make the Validity of a Call clear, is that of the Juſtice of the Miniſtry in it ſelf, that is to ſay, in regard of thoſe things that are taught and practiſed in it, when that Juſtice is in diſpute, as it is between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us; after which, when that point is once decided, we muſt paſs over to two other Queſtions; the one, whether the body, that is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97749:258"/>
to ſay the Society wherein one is, has it ſelf the Right to have Miniſters, and the other whether the Perſons who exerciſe the Miniſtry therein are well and duly called, as I have ſhewn in my third Obſervation. That firſt Point then being ſuppoſed, to wit, that the things that are taught and practiſed among the Proteſtants are good and Chriſtian, I ſay, that they cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with them the Right of their Miniſtry but by accuſing them of a Schiſm like that of the <hi>Luciferians</hi> or the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> But we have ſo clearly ſhewn that if we have Reaſon at the bottom, our Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is juſt, and that ſhe her ſelf is guilty of chiſm, that there is no further ground for that unjuſt Accuſation. They cannot therefore any further conteſt our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry with us, and in effect if we are true Believers, and if we are juſtly Separated from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is Evident that we are Lawfully United among our ſelves in a Religious Society, as I have ſhewn in the firſt Chapter of the Fourth Part. And if we are Lawfully United in a Religious Society, it is not leſs Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that all the Rights of the Chriſtian Society belong to us, and that in all thoſe Rights that of the Miniſtry is Compriſed, as it appears from my Sixth and Seventh Obſervation. So that our Right to a Miniſtry is indiſputable, ſuppoſing that we have Reaſon in the Foundation, and all that which they propound againſt us will remain null and Fallacious. If we have Reaſon at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, we are the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt; but the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt can never loſe its Rights, ſhe is never deprived of them, and ſhe cannot ſo much as deprive her of them, none can raviſh them from her; they are Rights that cannot be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated, they can neither be loſt by the Inundations or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions of the World, with and by Interruption of Poſſeſſion, or Invaſion of Enemies, as the Inheritances of the World are; and in one word, there where the true Faith and Charity is, there is the true Church, and where there is a true Church, there is the Right to a Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>But ſay they, Is the Miniſtry which you have that Antient and perpetual Miniſtry, that Jeſus Chriſt has eſtabliſhed in his Church, or is it a new one? For if it be a new one, it is a falſe and Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſtry, and if it be the Antient and perpetual Miniſtry of the Church, whence comes it to paſs that we do not ſee among you any of the degrees of that Hierarchy which was eſtabliſhed in the Church before your Reformation? I anſwer that our Miniſtry is that Antient and perpetual one that Jeſus Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97749:259"/>
have ſet up in the Church, and if it were a new one we muſt needs have ſet up a new Goſpel, which is a thing ſo remote from the Truth that our moſt paſſionate Adverſaries, except the Author of the Prejudices, would never in my Judgment have us charged with it. But I ſay that we muſt diſtinguiſh of the Eſſence of a Miniſtry from its State, as I have ſhewn in my Fourth Obſervation. Before the Reformation, we grant that the Miniſtry was preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Latin Church in regard of all that which was Eſſential to it, and it is in that that our Church has Succeeded it, ſo that in that Reſpect they are not two Miniſtries, but only one and the ſame, which we have retained. We preach the ſame Truth that they teach yet, we Adore one and the ſame God the Father Son and Holy-Ghoſt. There is among us a Baptiſm, an Euchariſt, a Government, a Diſcipline, as there was then, but we have not ſucceeded it in that bad and Corrupted State whereinto the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry was then fallen, we have no more either any Sacrificers of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, or a Soveraign Monarch of the Church, or Patriarchs, or Cardinals, or Preachers of Indulgences, or Framers of Legends, all that was not any thing of the Eſſence of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and in having retrenched thoſe kinds of things we have it no more aboliſh'd then a Town is aboliſhed when its exceſſes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched, or then a Houſe is aboliſhed when it is cleanſed, and its ruines repaired.</p>
               <p>As to a Perſonal Call, I ſay that we have that Body of the Church which only upon Earth has a Lawful Right to confer it on us. That which our Reformers had, they had from the Church in their days, which did not conſiſt in that Multitude of Prophane Worldly and Superſtitious Perſons which ſwell'd their Aſſemblies then, but in thoſe truly Faithful Perſons who as yet preſerved themſelves pure in the midſt of that Corruption, in that good Corn which as yet grew amidſt the Tares, although it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Swallowed up by them. It was in thoſe that the Right of the Miniſtry properly and truly reſided, it was thoſe who made as yet that Society any wayes Lawful, and it was from thoſe that the Juſtice of a Call proceeded. I confeſs, that they Communicated it then in a very corrupted State, and after a very impure manner, but God gave our firſt Reformers the Grace to purify theirs by the ſound Doctrine, and to rectify it by a Holy and Lawful Uſe. It is therefore with and by thoſe, that the Body of that Society which is Reformed has conferred that Call upon others, and that the Propagation of the Miniſtry has come down even to us, after
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97749:259"/>
the moſt Evangelical manner in the World, on one ſide with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, Examination, Proof, Inquiry, and Teſtimony of good manners, as exact as could poſſibly be made, and on the other with publick Prayers, Exhortation, Benediction, laying on of hands, Miſſion, and a particular Tye to a Flock. Behold here what our Call is in Regard of the Body of the Proteſtants. I do not deny that in ſome places of this Kingdom at the beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation there was not ſome Calls which were conferred by the People without a Paſtor, as that of <hi>La Riviere</hi> was at <hi>Paris</hi> in the year 1555. Which the Author of the Prejudices has not been wanting to reproach us with. But beſides that theſe are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſes of a very ſmall number, which hath not followed, nor produced any ſetled Cuſtom, and by Conſequence cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the whole Body of the Proteſtants, which has all along elſewhere had Paſtors called by the Ordinary wayes, beſides all that I ſay, I have ſhewn that in a Caſe of Abſolute neceſſity, ſuch as thoſe Flocks were in then, the People may Lawfully make uſe of that Right which God and the Nature of a Chriſtian Society have put into their hands.</p>

                     <hi>Prejud.</hi> Chap. 4. pag. 87.</note> 
                  <hi>ſome have <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited together, to make up a Third Compoſed of thoſe two. Some diſtinctly ſay that the miſſion of their Miniſters is Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, others that it is Ordinary, and others that it is Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and Ordinary both together. But as this laſt Opinion includes the two others, ſo it deſtroys it ſelf in deſtroying them. So that properly it will be only neceſſary to examine in particular the two firſt Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is in the firſt place very remarkable, that the Author of the Prejudices, after having raiſed the Queſtion, as he has done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt Reformers were <hi>Thieves and Robbers, Tyrants, Rebels, Falſe Paſtors and Sacrilegious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers of the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> he has reduced all his proof of it to wrangling about thoſe Qualities, of Ordinary or Extraordinary, that be given to their Call. From thoſe high words it ſeemed to have lain upon him to have ſhewn us that that Call was deſtroyed and annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without any Return, and that he ſhould at leaſt have brought us what would have wholly overthrown the firſt and <note place="margin">Reſource.</note> Natural Foundations upon which we eſtabliſh it. But, Thanks be to God, that is not done, and the choller of the Author of the Prejudices is turned upon thoſe Titles that we give to the Call of the firſt Reformers he does not further concern himſelf to know directly whether it is good and Lawful, but meerly to know
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97749:260"/>
whether it is Ordinary or Extraordinary, or whether it be neither the one nor the other. Moreover it is certain that to decide even this laſt Queſtion, it is very ill done to begin with the ſetting aſide the Sentiment of thoſe who hold that it is Ordinary and Extraordinary both together. For as thoſe Terms of Ordinary and Extraordinary are Ambiguous, and that by reaſon of their Ambiguity, it may be ſo that a Call that is Ordinary in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ſhall be Extraordinary in another, ſo to ſet aſide thoſe who would have that of the firſt Reformers to be Ordinary and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary both together, is to ſet aſide thoſe who would clear that Ambiguity; it is deſignedly to ſhut up the diſpute in Equivocal Propoſitions, to give way to the making a long diſcourſe to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it is in a word to imitate thoſe who propoſe nothing elſe to themſelves but how to caſt duſt in the Eyes, and to ſuſpend the Judgments of their Readers, in removing far from them the clear Knowledge of things. It is therefore neceſſary for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Prejudices to redreſs that, and becauſe that thoſe two Sentiments, one of which carries this with it, that that Call is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and the other that it was Ordinary, do not encounter one another at the bottom, it is neceſſary to ſhew in what reſpects both the one and the other may be ſaid. To this Effect, I ſhall firſt ſay a Word of the Miniſtry of the firſt Reformers, and then afterwards I ſhall ſpeak of their Call.</p>
               <p>As to their Miniſtry, it is true that it is not Extraordinary nor newly Inſtituted, but the ſame that the Apoſtles eſtabliſhed at firſt for the Preſervation and Propagation of the Church, which was preſerved in the Latin Church down to the Age of our Fathers in reſpect of all that was abſolutely Eſſential to it, and which ſhall alſo ſubſiſt unto the end of the World, as I have explained in the foregoing Chapter. We may ſay notwithſtanding, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in which they were employed was an Extraordinary Function of their Office. For however they did not need either a new Right or a new Miniſtry for that, ſince every Paſtor is bound to labour to Reform that which regards his Flock, when it is neceſſary that he ſhould do it, yet ſuch a Reformation as they made, is not a thing that ſhould be done alwayes. So that in that Reſpect their Miniſtry had ſomething Extraordinary, to wit, in as much as their Flocks had an Extraordinary need of their help to drive back thoſe Errors and Superſtitions which had got ground, as a veſſel that is ready to be Shipwrackt has an Extraordinary need of the Aſſiſtance of thoſe who Steer it, to avoid that intire deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97749:261"/>
wherewith it is threatned. But beſides this we may ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that it had this of Extraordinary in it, that though it was yet the ſame Goſpel Miniſtry which had till then ſubſiſted in the Latin Church, in reſpect of all its Eſſentials, yet they put it into another State then that wherein it was for many Ages before, as having purged and freed it from all the Corruptions that diſgraced it, and as thoſe things are called Extraordinary that are not wont to be ſeen, and which are not ſo often done, that Change of the Form or State that happened to the Miniſtry, after its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for ſo long a time appeared to the eyes of the people quite otherwiſe then they ſaw it then, may very well be called Extraordinary.</p>
               <p>As for that which regards their Call, it was not Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if by that Term they mean that it ſhould have come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God, as that of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Antient Prophets, or immediately from Jeſus Chriſt, as that of the Apoſtles, but it was Ordinary, that is to ſay, they received it from God medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by means of men. It is alſo certain that the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their Call, as to the greater part, was the very ſame with that that is moſt Common and uſual in the Church, which is, that they received their Ordination from the hand of thoſe Paſtors who were themſelves in that Office. All that therefore which there was of Extraordinary in their Call, in that reſpect, was, that they rectified it by freeing it from all the Impurity it had, and which came from the Corruption of the men of that Age, and in referring it to its true End, which ſhould be the Purity of Gods Worſhip, and the Salvation of Souls. I acknowledg that in their Adminiſtration they went beyond the intention of thoſe who had conferred their Offices on them, but they did no more in that then they ought; for the Miniſtry which they had received being Gods and the Churches, and not thoſe private mens who Communicated it, they were bound to refer theirs to the greateſt Glory of God and the Edification of his Church, and not to the Wills and Intereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and its Prelates, altho' ir was through their Channel that they had received it. They did well therefore to make uſe of that which they had of good in their Call, to purify that which was bad in it, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did well to make uſe of it againſt the ill intention of thoſe who had given it them for an ill end, even as thoſe who have received Baptiſm from an Heretical or Schiſmatical Society, are bound by that ſame Baptiſm which they have received from them,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97749:261"/>
to oppoſe themſelves as much as poſſibly they can to that Hereſy or Schiſm, and to make uſe of their very Baptiſm for it, altho' it ſhould be againſt the intention of thoſe who gave it to them. I acknowledge alſo that there were ſome few who received their Call immediately from the Churches hand, I would ſay, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the faithful people; and we may ſay of thoſe, that their Call was extraordinary, in the ſenſe that we call unuſual things Extraordinary, which happen very rarely, and which are done againſt Cuſtom and ordinary practice. For howſoever that thoſe Calls were not unlawfully made, and without Right, as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the foregoing Chapter, it is notwithſtanding True that it is not, nor ought to be the Common Practice, and that it has no place but in a caſe of abſolute Neceſſity. So alſo in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Call of <hi>Martin</hi> V. may be ſaid to be Extraordinary, who was called to the Papacy immediately by the whole Body of the Latin Prelates aſſembled in the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and not by the Colledge of Cardinals, as it is ordinarily done.</p>
               <p>As to thoſe Miniſters who ſucceeded them, and who received their Ordination from the hands of the firſt Reformers, their Call was without doubt Ordinary, and conformable to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Antient Church, according to the <hi>Idea</hi> that the Scripture gives us of it, and all that it can have of Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſiſts in this, that in the diſtinction of Biſhops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters they have not followed them, and it is the Presbytery and not the Biſhop who gives the Ordination, but in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing they did nothing remote from that which was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Apoſtolick Church, acording to the <hi>Idea</hi> of it that the Scripture furniſhes us with, ſince Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in expreſs terms concerning <hi>Timothy, That he had received it by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</hi> I do not here enter upon the Queſtion, whether that Diſtinction is of Divine or only of Humane Right, I will ſay ſomething to that in the cloſe. I do not ſo much as blame thoſe who obſerve it, as a thing very Antient, and I would not have it made a matter of difference in thoſe places, wherein it is eſtabliſhed, but I ſay where that Diſtinction is not obſerved, as it is not, nor can be amongſt the Proteſtants of this Kingdom, their Call will not ceaſe to be lawful, ſince beſides the Caſe of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, which ſufficiently diſpences with that Form, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that neither the Biſhop nor the Presbyter are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any more than Executors of the Will of the Church in that Regard, and not the Maſters of that Call, beſides that I ſay, there
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97749:262"/>
is a Formal Text of the Apoſtle that juſtifies the Right that the Church has to give the Impoſition of hands by the Presbytery, which alone is ſufficient to ſtop the mouth of all Contradiction whatſoever.</p>
               <p>That being ſo explained, we may eaſily ſee what we ought to anſwer to all thoſe petty Objections of which the Author of the Prejudices has compoſed his fourth and fifth Chapters. <hi>Some</hi> ſays he, <hi>were called to the Miniſtry and made Paſtors only by Lay-men, others were ordained by Prieſts only, and thoſe who had been</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prejud. chap. 4. page 78.</note> 
                  <hi>Ordained by Biſhops lifted themſelves up against their Ordainers, and that Church which had given them their Miſſion.</hi> I have ſhewn in the foregoing Chapter, that thoſe who were called by Lay-men, that is to ſay, by the whole Body of the Church, had a ſufficient Call. That which I have alſo ſaid concerning thoſe who received their Ordination from the Presbytery, does not leave any more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and as to thoſe who reſiſted their own Ordainers, I have ſhewn that they did nothing in all that whereunto their very Office did not bind them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We may ſee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>yet further, by the thirty firſt Article of their Confeſſion of Faith, that it was upon this ſuppoſition of a power given</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prejud. chap. 5. page 91.</note> 
                  <hi>immediately by God to theſe men Extraordinarily ſent to Order the Church a new, that all their pretended Reformation is founded.</hi> That Article of our Confeſſion of Faith ſays not, that the Church had abſolutely periſhed, nor that the Miniſtry was intirely extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that the Church was fallen into Ruine and Deſolation, and that its State was interrupted, which only ſhews that ſhe as well as the Miniſtry under which ſhe was, were both in the greateſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and this is that which we alſo hold. It ſays not that God had given an immediate Miſſion to the Reformers, but that God had raiſed them up after an extraordinary manner to order the Church a new. That ſignifies that God by his Providence gave them Extaordinary Gifts to undertake ſo great a Work as that of the Reformation was, and that he accompanied them with his Bleſſing. All that includes neither a new Revelation, nor a new immediate Miſſion, and hinders not, that the Right which they had to employ themſelves in it ſhould not be annexed to their Charge, and that it ſhould not be common not only to all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but even to all Chriſtians, as I have ſhewn in my Second part.</p>

                  <hi>the Office of Miniſters ſhould receive a new Impoſition of hands, which ſhews that they ſuppoſe their precedent Miſſion to be Null, and ſo that that which</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Zuinglius <hi>Received from the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ſignify'd nothing, whence it follows, that that which they aſcribe to them can be no other than Extraordinary.</hi> There is a great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Call which was given before the Reformation, and that which is at this day given in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſince thoſe Two Communions are ſeparated. The Former was indeed very much corrupted, but yet nevertheleſs it ſuppoſes the conſent of the whole Latin Church, and it was not given by a Party ſo confirmed in Errour; where the ſecond ſuppoſes no other than the conſent of a Party ſo confirmed in thoſe Errours which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be moſt contrary to the Purity of the Goſpel, which makes the matter ſo that our Society can no more look upon it as a Lawfull Call, in regard of it and its Service. Beſides that when we ſee the Conditions that are neceſſary to a Lawful Call, as Examination, Information of manners, and the like, ſo ill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Chriſtian Prudence will not ſuffer us to Truſt to her and her Elections, which for the moſt part would be Null, if they were Examin'd according to their own Canons.</p>
               <p>Calvin <hi>has wrote that God ſet up Apoſtles in his time, or at leaſt, Evangeliſts to draw men from the Party of Antichriſt.</hi> I anſwer, <note place="margin">Prejug. chap. 5. pag. 92.</note> that <hi>Calvin</hi> only called the Reformers Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, by ſome kind of reſemblance which they had with the firſt Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, in ſome reſpect, not that they brought a new Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them into the World, as the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts did, but becauſe God made uſe of them, to make the light of his Goſpel which was much darkened ſtrike upon the eyes of Men with ſplendor, and they honour thoſe to this day with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Apoſtles who now employ themſelves in making Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity known to the Nations that are Strangers to it, although they are not immediately ſent from God, and though they have not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new Revelation.</p>
               <p>He alleadges in the end, the Diſpute that was between a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant named <hi>Adrian Saravias</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> where <hi>Beza</hi> ſeems to <note place="margin">Prejug. chap. 5. pag. 94.</note> admit of only an Extraordinary Call in the Reformers, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That as well <hi>Saravias</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> are particular Authors, who may have had both the one and the other thoughts a little exceſſive about this matter, and it may be may have even diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the one againſt the other, without well underſtanding one
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97749:263"/>
another. This is that which falls out every day between perſons otherwiſe very learned. <hi>Beza</hi> rejected the Ordinations of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not, that he thought the Miniſtry was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinct there, nor that they had not there any Right to a Call, but becauſe the Calls of perſons there were made after a very confuſed and corrupted manner without Examination either of Doctrine or manners, by reaſon of which they were moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently given to unworthy perſons, and that inſtead of ordaining them to Preach the Goſpel, they ordain them only to Sacrifice. That concludes that the Ordinary Call which the firſt Reformers received was not purer than that of others, if God had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them the Grace to rectify it as they did by a juſt and lawful uſe of it, but that does not conclude that ſuch as it was it did not put them into a Right and Obligation to cleanſe it from that ill which it had by that good which remained in it.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Prejudices oppoſes further an Article of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional <note place="margin">Prejug. chap. 5. pag. 100.</note> Synod held at <hi>Gap, Anno</hi> 1603. which he ſets down in theſe words, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the</hi> 31 <hi>Article of the Confeſſion of Faith, it having been put to the queſtion whether when they came to Treat of the Call of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, they ſhould found the Authority which they had to Reform the Church and to Teach, upon the Call which they had received from the</hi> Roman <hi>Church: The Aſſembly determined that they ought meerly to referr it to the Article of the Extraordinary Call, by which God extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily and inwardly ſtirr'd them up to their Miniſtry, and not in the leaſt to any thing that remained of that Ordinary Corrupted Call.</hi> But ſince he would give himſelf the trouble to look into our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Synods, he ought not to ſtop there, he ought to go on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to that of <hi>Rochel,</hi> which was held immediately after that of <hi>Gap</hi> in the year 1607, and there he would have found that that Article having been ſet down differently in ſeveral Copies, and having been altered by the negligence of the Copiers, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed in that Synod, which was drawn into an Act in theſe words: In the 31 Article of the Confeſſion of Faith of the Synod of <hi>Gap,</hi> wherein mention is made of the firſt Paſtors of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, theſe words <hi>and to [Teach]</hi> which are found in ſome Copies, ſhould be raiſed out, and in the place of <hi>meerly</hi> there ſhould be put, <hi>chiefly;</hi> and that laſt Clauſe, <hi>[And not in the leaſt to any thing that remained of that Ordinary Corrupted Call]</hi> ſhould be alſo mended, <hi>Rather than to that little which remained of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Call.</hi> To have made uſe of that Article ſeriouſly, he ought to have done it not in the State wherein the ignorance of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97749:263"/>
the Copiers had put it, but in that wherein a whole Synod had re-eſtabliſhed it. At the bottom it will appear that they there treated only about a Call for the Reformation, and not for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Ordinary Miniſtry, and the Synod does not, but in ſome reſpects only, deny that that Call for a Reformation, was not founded upon that that the firſt Reformers had received from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> howſoever corrupted it was, but it would that it ſhould be chiefly referred to a particular Providence of God, which by Extraordinary Gifts and Talents had raiſed men up for ſo great a work. In effect, although we ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that in the Church, the rejecting or Reformation of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſhould be the common Right of all Chriſtians, and that that Right would yet more eſpecially belong to the Ordinary Paſtors then to others, by the Obligation of their Charge joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that of their Baptiſm, yet we do not fail to acknowledge alſo, that there was ſomething extraordinary in the perſons of the Reformers, to wit, the Gifts, or the admirable Talents which made them fit for that work, and capable of reducing their Right into Act, without which their Right would have been to no purpoſe, as it did remain in divers others unprofitable, who had not the ſame Gifts. But that very thing might gain them the greateſt Authority, and this is that which the Synod would ſay, and which we ſay alſo with it. For we diſtinguiſh three things in the Reformers, from whence there reſults as full and intire a Call to Reform the Church as they can deſire: the one is, The general and common Right that all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have to Combat Errours, ſince they are all called to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Truth; the other is, a more peculiar Right which they had for the ſame thing in quality of Paſtors, for how impure ſoever their Call was, it would alwayes bind them to have a Care of their Flocks, and to procure Gods Glory; and the third is, the Extraordinary Graces and Light that God had communicated to them, and rendred them thereby fit for that work. But it is this laſt that reduc'd the two others into Act, and therefore they look'd on it there principally when they treated of the Reformation, becauſe if they had never met with this, the two others would have been uſeleſs Rights, and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Obligations.</p>
               <p>After that, it is eaſy to comprehend how the Author of the Prejudices was miſtaken, when under a pretence of that Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Call, that we Attribute to the firſt Reformers, in reſpect
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97749:264"/>
of their Gifts or Talents, he imagines that he can lay it to our charge that we believe that the ordinary Miniſtry was intirely loſt, and that it was renewed by an extraordinary and immediate Call of God. For it is upon that, that with great heat, to very ill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he ſpends his reaſonings throughout his whole fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in Allegations of Fathers, and Obſervations to no purpoſe upon the Rights of that pretended immediate Miniſtry. We An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him in a Word, that he only Combats his own Shadow, for we do not hold that the Ordinary Miniſtry eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles was abſolutely extinct. It is a Good that belongs to the Church, and as the Church has alwayes ſubſiſted by the ſpecial Providence of God, though in a different State, that ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has alſo made that Good to ſubſiſt alwayes. It is True that it was very ill diſpens'd while it was in the hands of bad Stewards, and that where the Inheritage ſhould have been culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and have brought forth without doubt much fruit, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on the contrary abundance of Thorns and Briars. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Inheritance was not loſt. The Miniſtry was alwayes preſerved, not only <hi>de Jure,</hi> in as much as the Church is never loſt, but <hi>de facto</hi> alſo, for it alwayes had Miniſters, ill cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen indeed, ill called, deſigned to bad uſes, called by very confuſed Calls, but called notwithſtanding, and having a Right ſufficient to make them do their Duty if they would, and if they were capable. So that the good State of the Miniſtry might be very well altered, Corrupted, Interrupted, overthrown, but the Miniſtry was not abſolutely loſt</p>
               <p>I will not be afraid even to go further, and to ſay that when it ſhould be true that the Miniſtry ſhould be wholly annihilated, that which notwithſtanding has never hapned, and it may pleaſe God that it never ſhall, it would not be neceſſary that God ſhould renew it by an immediate and every-way Supernatural Miſſion, while there ſhould be two or three of the Faithful in the World, who would be able to Aſſemble together in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt. For the Right of the Miniſtry would alwayes remain in thoſe two or three, and they might confer a Lawful Call upon one of themſelves. If it could even happen that there ſhould not be abſolutely any more Faith upon the Earth, and that Hereſy or Paganiſm or Judaiſm, or Mahumetaniſm ſhould generally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the whole World, without leaving any Truly Faithful in it, which certainly will never come to paſs ſince we have the promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt to the contrary, I ſay in that caſe, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97749:264"/>
that the Book of the Holy Scripture remained, the <note n="*" place="margin">Germe.</note> young Buds of the Church, and that of the Miniſtry, would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt even there. The Apoſtles who left it to the world, would yet further call men from thence a ſecond Time to the true Faith, and by that true Faith to the Re-eſtabliſhing of a Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and by the Re-eſtabliſhing of that Chriſtian Society to that of the Miniſtry, without any abſolute neceſſity of Gods immediately ſending new Apoſtles. One man only who ſhould learn the heavenly Truths contained in that Book, might teach them to others and reduce Chriſtianity to its firſt State, if God would Accompany the word of that man with his Ordinary Bleſſing. Thoſe who are acquainted with Hiſtory are not Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that in the Fourth Century, two young men named the one <hi>Edeſius,</hi> and the other <hi>Frumanius,</hi> having been taken on the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theodoret. hiſt</hi> lib. 1. cap. 23.</note> Sea and carried Captive to the King of the <hi>Indies,</hi> converted many perſons to the Chriſtian-Faith in that Country, and that they might make Aſſemblies there, where they might celebrate the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>This is that which manifeſtly diſcovers the Injuſtice of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Prejudices, and other Writers of Controverſy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they demanded Miracles to prove the Call of the firſt Reformers. For while the Scripture remains in the midſt of men, it is not neceſſary to make new miracles to Authorize Miniſters; that Scripture ſufficiently Authoriſes the Church immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by it ſelf to confer a Call, when its Paſtors forſake it. It would ſufficiently Authoriſe one man alone, whoever he ſhould be, a Lay-man or Clergy-man, to communicate the light of his Faith to others, if he were the only Faithful Perſon that was in the World: it would Authoriſe two or three Faithful, who ſhould find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone, to Aſſemble together and to provide for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Propagation of their Society, and Miracles would not <note place="margin">

Miracles are neceſſary to thoſe who preach new Doctrines, and thoſe which are not of antient Revelation, and which beſides have not in themſelves any Character of Truth ſuch as the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the Corporal Preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, Invocation of Saints, Merit of good Works, Adoration of the Hoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97749:265"/>
It belongs to thoſe who teach thoſe things to tell us whence they hold them, and ſince they give us them as holding them from Gods hand, it belongs to them to prove them by Miracles, for they cannot prove them otherwiſe, and when they ſhould even have wrought Miracles, or things that ſhould paſs for ſuch, it would belong to us to examine them, ſince Jeſus Chriſt has given us warnings upon that point, which we ought not to neglect.</p>
               <p>See here what I had to ſay upon the Fifth Chapter of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Prejudices. The ſixth wherein he treats further of the ſame matter contains nothing which I have not already ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. It pretends that the Call of our Firſt Reformers was not Ordinary, under a pretence that ſome few received their Miniſtry from the people, that others were ordain'd by meer Prieſts, and that thoſe who had been Ordained by Biſhops, have, ſays he, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athematiz'd that Church from which they received their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But as to the firſt, we have ſhewn him that the Calls that are made by a Faithful People, are Juſt and Lawful in a caſe of abſolute neceſſity, that naturally diſpences with Formalities. Beſides that thoſe Calls were very few in number, that they were not followed, that they do not infer any Conſequence againſt the Body of the Paſtors and that even when it ſhould have had any Irregularity, that Irregularity would have been ſufficiently repaired by the hand of Fellowſhip, which the other Paſtors have given thoſe who were ſo called, and by the conſent that the whole Body of that Society gave to their Calls. We ought not for that to leave off holding them for Ordinary, although in that Reſpect they ſhould be remote from the Common Practice, no more or leſs then they in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to leave off holding the Call of Pope <hi>Martin</hi> V. and that of divers other Popes for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, although they were not made according to the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prejug.</hi> chap. 6. pag. 129.</note> Forms. <hi>I demand of their Miniſters,</hi> ſays the Author of the Prejudices, <hi>ſome Paſſages of Scripture that clearly give Lay-men a Right to ordain Miniſters in any caſe.</hi> That demand is but a vain wrangling, for when the Scripture recommends to the Faithful the taking diligent heed to the Preſervation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their Faith, and to propagate it to their Children, it gives them clearly enough by that very thing a ſufficient Right, to make uſe of all the means that are proper for that, and that are naturally appointed to it. But every one knows that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is one of thoſe means, whence it follows that the Obligation
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97749:265"/>
that the Scripture layes upon the Faithful people in that reſpect, includes that of creating it ſelf its Paſtors, when it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they ſhould have them otherwiſe; for that he that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains the end, ordains alſo by conſequence the means that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally appointed for that end. When the Scripture commands that all things be done with Order in the Church, it gives by that very thing clearly enough a ſufficient Right to the Church to make its Paſtors, when it has none, and when it can have none but by that way, ſince it is clear that Paſtors belong to that Order. In fine, when the Scripture teaches that the Faithful people have a Right to chuſe their Paſtors, it teaches clearly enough by that very thing, that they have alſo a Right themſelves to inſtal them in their Office in a caſe of neceſſity, for that Call conſiſting much more Eſſentially in Election than in Inſtallation, which is but a Formality, there is no reaſon to believe that God would have given the people a Right to have choſen their Paſtors, and to have made them be inſtall'd by other Paſtors, and that he has not given them at the ſame time that of inſtalling them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when it cannot be done otherwiſe, ſince naturally that which we have a Right to do by another, we have a Right to do by our ſelves.</p>
               <p>As to thoſe who were ordained by meer Prieſts, can the Author of the Prejudices be ignorant that the Diſtinction of a Biſhop and a Prieſt or Miniſter, as if they had two differing Offices, is not only a thing that they cannot prove out of the Scripture, but that even contradicts the expreſs words of the Scripture, where Biſhops and Prieſts are the names of one and the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, from whence it follows that the Prieſts having by their firſt Inſtitution a Right to confer Ordination, that Right cannot be taken from them by meerly humane Rules. Can the Author of the Prejudices be ignorant that Saint <hi>Jerome, Hilary</hi> the Deacon, and after them <hi>Hincmar,</hi> wrote formarly touching the Unity, or as they ſpeak the Identity of a Prieſt and a Biſhop in the beginning of the Church, and about the firſt riſe of that diſtinction which was afterwards made of them into two different charges? Can he be ignorant that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf, writing to Saint <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> refers that difference not to the firſt Inſtitution of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, but meerly to an Eccleſiaſtical uſe. Although, ſays he, that by different Terms of honour the cuſtom of the Church has now brought in the Epiſcopacy to be above the Prieſthood, yet <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> is in many things beneath <hi>Jerome?</hi> Can he be ignorant that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97749:266"/>
ſome Fathers Teach us that the Ordination of a Prieſt and a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop are but one and the ſame Ordination, and not two, which diſtinctly ſhews that they are but one and the ſame Office? And as to the right of making Ordinations, can the Author of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices deny that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery? Can he deny that the Prieſts did not hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordain, as well as the Biſhops? Does not <hi>Eutychius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> relate that Saint <hi>Mark</hi> ſetting up <hi>Ananias</hi> to be Patriarch of that ſame Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> eſtabliſhed alſo twelve Prieſts with him, to the end ſays he, that when the See ſhould be vacant, it ſhould be filled by one of them, and that the Eleven that remain'd ſhould lay their hands on him and bleſs and create the Patriarch; and that afterwards they ſhould chuſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man and make him a Prieſt in the place of him who ſhould be choſen Patriarch, and that by that means the number of Twelve might remain always compleat? And does not Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> more Antient then <hi>Eutychius</hi> ſay to the ſame ſence, that at <hi>Alexandria</hi> down from Saint <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangeliſt unto <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclius</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhops, the Prieſts alwayes took out one from among themſelves whom they ſet in the higheſt Seat and called him Biſhop, after the ſame manner, ſays he as an Army makes an Emperour, or as if the Deacons ſhould chuſe one out of themſelves and call him their Arch-Deacon? Does not <hi>Caſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> relate the ſtory of a certain young man named <hi>Daniel,</hi> who liv'd among the Monks of <hi>Egypt</hi> about the year 420. and who was firſt made Deacon, and in the end Prieſt by his Abbot cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> who was himſelf but a Prieſt? Does not <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf ſay after <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> that after the Death of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> in the year 555. <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Succeſſor received his Ordination at the hands of two Biſhops and a Prieſt of <hi>Oſtia</hi> named <hi>Andrew?</hi> Which ſhews that even then the Prieſts were not wholly excluded the Right of Ordination. They were not yet abſolutely ſo in the ſeventh Century, ſince we learn from <hi>Bede's</hi> Hiſtory, That the Monks and Prieſts of the Iſle of <hi>Jovan</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> not only ordained Prieſts among them, but even Biſhops alſo, and that they ſent them into <hi>England,</hi> and that thoſe Biſhops were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Abbot, who was himſelf but a meer Prieſt.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a Right that is naturally belonging to the Prieſts and of which they cannot be deprived by humane Conſtitution, and Orders, which cannot hinder that Right from alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining annexed to their Office, and that they may not reducs it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97749:266"/>
into Act when the neceſſity of the Church requires it. In effect, <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> has made no ſcruple to ſay according to his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> That if there were no more but three meer Prieſts in the World, one of them muſt needs conſecrate the other to be a Biſhop and the other to be an Arch-Biſhop. And to ſpeak my own Thoughts freely, it ſeems to me, that that firm opinion of the abſolute neceſſity of Epiſcopacy, that goes ſo high as to own no Church, or Call, or Miniſtry, or Sacraments, or Salvation in the World, where there are no Epiſcopal Ordinations, although there ſhould be the True Faith, the True Doctrine and Piety there, and which would that all Religion ſhould depend on a Formality, and even on a Formality that we have ſhewn to be of no other than Humane Inſtitution, that Opinion I ſay cannot be lookt on otherwiſe then as the very worſt character and mark of the higheſt Hypocricy, a piece of Phariſaiſm throughout, that ſtrains at a Gnat when it ſwallows a Camel, and I cannot avoid having at leaſt a contempt of thoſe kind of thoughts, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for thoſe who fill their heads with them.</p>
               <p>I come now to that which the Author of the Prejudices pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, That if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were ſo corrupted as we hold, its Calls could not be lawful, from whence it follows that our Firſt Reformers, who had received their Ordination from the Hands of the Biſhops of that Church, had received no other Call than what was Null, and Unlawful. But we have anſwered him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that although the Latin Church before the Reformation was very much corrupted, the Eſſence of the Miniſtry did not fail to be preſerved in it, and that though its Calls were very [rude] and confuſed, yet they did not ceaſe to be Calls and to be lawful ones, in proportion to that Good which remain'd in that Society wherein God yet kept the Truly Faithful. The Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian Doctrine yet remaining there with its Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, which was found in ſome perſons, the Miniſtry, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence their Calls, were yet lawful in that reſpect, and the firſt Reformers, who referred thoſe which they received to their right and lawful uſe, in freeing them from that impurity which they had they were by that means rectifyed, purifyed, and freed from that ill which they had. It is to no purpoſe that he alleadges the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſome Antients who ſeem to have held Ordinations made by Hereticks Null, for he cannot deny that the common Opinion of the Church was not contrary to it, that all that ought to be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97749:267"/>
held for good and lawful, that was good and lawful in it ſelf, vvhich the Heretical or Schiſmatical Society held, and to be approved rather than denyed. This is vvhat Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expreſly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt. de Bapt. contr. Donat.</hi> lib. 3 ſub finem.</note> teaches. Not only, ſays he, our Fathers vvho lived before <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Agrippin,</hi> but thoſe alſo vvho lived ſince, have obſerved that vvholſome Cuſtom of approving and not denying all that vvhich they have found to be Divine and Lavvful that Hereticks and Schiſmaticks preſerv'd intire, and of rejecting that vvhich they beheld to be forreign and erroneous among them. Let the Author of the Prejudices read what that Father has vvrote not only in his ovvn name, but in the Name of the vvhole Church, againſt <hi>Parmenio</hi> and the other <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> vvho ſaid that Baptiſm truly remained among Hereticks, but not the Right to Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Baptiſm, and he will find that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſtrongly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that the Right of Ordination, upon which that of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Baptiſm depends, remains even among Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, in reſpect of all that good that remains there. I have ſaid elſewhere, that in the Confuſions of <hi>Arianiſm</hi> divers Ordinations made by <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops were not held to be Null. In effect that of <hi>Meletius</hi> ordained by the <hi>Eudoxians,</hi> who had it diſputed for ſome time, by ſome few, vvas at laſt generally acknovvledged to be lavvful, and that of <hi>Faelix</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> vvhich vvas alſo made by the <hi>Arians</hi> vvas never called in queſtion, both the one and the other puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their Miniſtry by returning to the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>I ſhould have ſhut up this Chapter, and vvith it this vvork, if I did not further think my ſelf bound to anſvver that great and ſolemn defiance of the Author of the Prejudices about the validity of my Baptiſm, not that I pretend to vie vvith him in his manner of diſputing, but meerly becauſe I believe that I have been very vvell baptiſed. <hi>I do not fear,</hi> ſays he, <hi>openly to maintain to Monſieur</hi> Claude, <hi>That remaining in the Principles of his ſect, he neither has nor can have any rational aſſurance of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prejug. chap.</hi> 17. pag. 422.</note> 
                  <hi>validity of the Baptiſm which is adminiſtred and approved in their Communion. That by conſequence he does not know whether he is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, or whether any Calviniſt ever was. That all the certainty he can pretend to have is raſh and ill grounded: That it can be no other than a certainty of Fancy and Humour and not of Knowledge and Truth, and that he can never have a rational one but in ſincerely acknowledging the falſeneſs of the Principles of his Religion, and in rendring that</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:97749:267"/>
                  <hi>deference and ſubmiſſion to the Catholick Church which he ows it. I ſpeak to him purpoſely after this manner to engage him the more to clear out this matter to us.</hi> It was not neceſſary for that to ſpeak to me after that manner, for he very well knows that I have all the readineſs in the World to content him. A word is enough without any heat and Elevation of voice to make me o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. What does he then deſire I ſhould do? <hi>To ſhew him,</hi> he adds, <hi>what he has to do, and what that proof ought neceſſarily to include, I</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 4 24.</note> 
                  <hi>beſeech him to note that the validity of the Baptiſm of the</hi> Calviniſts <hi>depends upon four Principles.</hi> Let him blot out the word <hi>Beſeech,</hi> which agrees neither with the manner in which he ſpeaks to me, nor with that wherewith I deſire to obey him. <hi>Firſt, as they were all Baptiſed in their Infancy, they muſt, to the end they may be certain that their Baptiſm was good, be aſſured, that the Baptiſm of Infants be good, and that the</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>who deny it are in an Errour. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as they were all Baptiſed by Sprinkling &amp; not by Immerſion, they cannot further be aſſured of the validity of their Baptiſm, unleſs they know certainly that Baptiſm by ſprinkling is good, and that Immerſion is not neceſſary, In the third place, as they all proceeded either me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately or immediately from the Catholick Church, which they ſo loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſe of Hereſy and Idolatry, it neceſſarily follows, that they were all Baptiſed either mediately or immediately by</hi> Hereticks. <hi>They cannot therefore have rational Certainty of their being Baptiſed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at leaſt they are aſſured, That the Baptiſm which they received in an Heretical Communion is good, or that that which is adminiſtred by a man not Baptiſed, does not fail to be good. In fine, the</hi> Calveniſts <hi>being perſwaded on one ſide that Baptiſm adminiſtred by Lay-men is Null and of no effect, and on the other, that the Catholick Prieſts and Biſhops are falſe Prieſts and falſe Biſhops, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as they derive their Baptiſm from thoſe falſe Prieſts and falſe Biſhops, they muſt needs ſhew us by the Scripture the agreement of theſe opinions, and that they can prove by clear and expreſs paſſages out of it, that although the Call of the Catholick Prieſts ſhould be Null and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful, they have yet nevertheleſs that Power of Baptiſing which the Laity has not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See here therefore what I have to do; but I need to ſay but a word to each point. I ſay then as to the firſt, That when the Scripture has ſaid, <hi>Be Baptiſed every one of you in the Name of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, for the Promiſe is to you, and to your Children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call, it</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:97749:268"/>
                  <hi>has clearly eſtabliſhed Infant Baptiſm.</hi> For ſince Baptiſm ought to be given to them to whom the promiſe is made, and that that is made to our Children as well as to us, it ought to be given not only to us, but to our Children. So that without going any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have in that reſpect all the Certainty that I can reaſonably deſire.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond, I ſay that the Word Baptiſe, equally ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying in the Original Tongue to plunge and to waſh, and being uſed divers times in this latter ſence, as it may appear in the Tranſlation of <hi>Mons</hi> in the ſeventh of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> and eleventh of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and there being moreover nothing in the Scripture that preciſely enjoins Immerſion or forbids Aſperſion, it is my part to believe that in the Thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt thoſe two wayes of Baptizing are indifferent, and that ſo much the more as I know the Spirit of the Goſpel is not ſo nice and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual about forms, or the manners of External Actions, which is proper to Superſtition. So that I have further for that all the Aſſurance that I ought to have.</p>
               <p>For the third, being certain as I am by the Promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt, that God has alwayes Preſerved a True Church in the World, that is to ſay, the Truly Faithful howſoever mixt they may have been with the Worldly, I am aſſured alſo that the Baptiſm which was Adminiſtred not only before the Reformation, but ſince, in the Latin Church, and in other Chriſtian-Societies where the Eſſence of Baptiſm remains, is good becauſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made in the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, it is the Baptiſm of the True Church, although it be adminiſtred by Perſons filled with Errors and Superſtitions. Baptiſm is not theirs, they are only the Miniſters of it. That Sacrament belongs to God and his Truly Faithful ones, in what Quarter of the World ſoever they be. That ſame Scripture that ſayes, <hi>That the Promiſe is made to us and to our Children, and to all that are a far of, even as many as the Lord ſhall call,</hi> ſays by a neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that the Seal of that Promiſe, which is Baptiſm, and all the other Rights of the Covenant of Jeſus Chriſt, belongs to us and to our Children, that is to ſay, to the Truly Faithful. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks who Adminiſter it, do not do it, as a good that belongs to them under that Quality, for in that reſpect nothing belongs to them, but as a good that belongs to the True Church, the Diſpenſation whereof they have, by the part which they have
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97749:268"/>
yet with her. For they Baptiſe not by that which divides them from the truly Faithful, but by that which after ſome manner Aſſociates and unites them with them. It is therefore the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the True Church which they give and not that of Hereſy, it is the Church that Baptiſes by them, and in that reſpect they are yet, as I have ſaid, the Diſpenſers of its goods. If the Author of the Prejudices deſires yet further to ſee a greater Number ot proofs drawn from the ſame Scripture that ſhould Eſtabliſh this Truth, he needs but to read what Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has wrote in his Treatiſe againſt the Epiſtle of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and that of Baptiſm againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and he will learn there not to make any more Queſtions of that Nature.</p>
               <p>I know not for the reſt, whether he as well as the others of his Communion who ſhall take the pains to read this work, will be ſatisfied. But I dare ſay at leaſt that I have done all that was poſſible for me to do, to ſet before them, without Offence, the Truths that are moſt Important for them to know. It belongs to them to make a ſerious Reflection upon that which I have repreſented to them, and upon the preſent State of Chriſtianity, which the prophaneneſs, Impiety, and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of mens Minds do every day reduce into an Evident danger of ruine, if we do not bring a Remedy, both on the one and the other ſide. Nevertheleſs inſtead of having in view that grand Intereſt upon which the Glory of God wholly depends, and the Salvation of men, they apply themſelves only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us, and their Paſſion prevails to that height, that they do not take heed of making irreparable Breaches in Religion, as that is, of bringing the Uſe and Authority of the Holy Scripture to nothing, provided they can but do us any Miſchief. But although they ſhould do whatſoever they pleas'd, God would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be a Witneſs on our Side that in the Foundation of the Cauſe, that upon which we have Separated from them, is the Love which we have for the Truth, and the Deſire that we have to Work out our own Salvation. And to let them ſee that it is not a falſe Prejudice that Corrupts us, let them go through all the Chriſtian Communions that are in the world, Let them Judg in cold blood, and I am aſſured that they will come to a ſerious Agreement that ours is the pureſt Church, nd the moſt approaching to the Primitive one. Our Opinions are the Fundamental Opinions of Religion, which are great, Solid
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97749:269"/>
and Convincing; our Worſhip has nothing that is not Evangelical, for it conſiſts in Prayers to God, in Thanksgivings, in Singing of Pſalms, in Celebration of Faſts, in Humiliation, in Acts of Repentance, in tears and groans, when we are preſt with the thoughts of our Sins and the Wrath of God; our Morals conſiſt more in Exhortations, in Cenſures, in Corrections, in Threatnings on Gods ſide, in Repreſentations of the Motives that bind us to do good Works, then in unprofitable deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Caſes of Conſcience. Our Government is plain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Formalities of the <note n="*" place="margin">Barreau.</note> Bar, founded as much as can be upon good Reaſon, Juſtice and Charity, but very oppoſite to the Maximes of Humane Policy, and eſpecially to Ambition, Covetouſneſs, and Vanity, which we believe to be the Mortal Enemies of Religion. Every one in the World knows that, and yet notwithſtanding the Author of the Prejudices, and all thoſe who with him take falſe lights, have not fail'd to cry out againſt us not only after a very uncharitable but an unchriſtian manner. As for us, we ſhall alwayes pray to God for thoſe who will not Love us, we ſhall bleſs them that Curſe us, but we ſhall alſo with <hi>Gamaliel</hi> give them this Advice, Take heed that in Tormenting us, you do not fight againſt God, inſtead of fighting with him. Let us pray on both ſides that he would give us his Bleſſing and his Peace, and that he would make us to do his Will.</p>
