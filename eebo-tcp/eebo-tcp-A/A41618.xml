            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PAPISTS PROTESTING AGAINST <hi>Proteſtant-Popery.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MY <hi>Replier</hi> begins with Complements; and I cannot but admire his art of weaving raillery into them ſo neatly, that every Eye will not diſcern which is which. But of all his Complements I take the <hi>Reply</hi> it ſelf to be the greateſt. Now in good manners I ſhould take my turn with my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments: but am forc'd to drop theſe, and ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my guard; for the <hi>Replier,</hi> while he Compliments me with one hand, is giving me a box with the other; in his very next lines calling in queſtion my <hi>honeſty,</hi> without any mincing it at all. In the Miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Papiſt, he ſays, <hi>I have ſhew'd ſome Art, but very little Honeſty.</hi> The <hi>Replier</hi> ſaid juſt before that he would <hi>compliment no more,</hi> and is as good as <note place="margin">p. 1.</note> his word. As for me, I am much miſtaken, if I find not upon occaſion, more vouchers for my honeſty, then Art: If I did by chance ſtumble into it, 'twas againſt my inclination, and I am ſure I fell up-hill.</p>
            <p>But he would have my Art lye in this; that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I was told in the <hi>Anſwer, that ſome of thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations, which I had made of a Papiſt, and</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56115:3"/>
               <hi>given out for the Proteſtant Character of Popery, were my own ignorant, or childiſh, or willful Miſtakes, I craftily inſinuate, that they grant all my Miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of a Papiſt, to be ignorant, childiſh, or will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miſtakes.</hi> Which is in ſhort the <hi>Anſwer</hi> gives <hi>ſome,</hi> and I take <hi>all.</hi> And yet thoſe two little words, upon which the whole Streſs and Truth of his charge lie, are neither in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> nor <hi>Reflections;</hi> but are providentially juggled in here by himſelf, to give the Reader an early taſt of his own Honeſty, while he challenges mine. The <hi>Anſwerer</hi> had ſaid, <hi>muſt the Character now ſuppos'd to be common to Proteſtants,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 10.</note> 
               <hi>be taken from his ignorant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Miſtakes?</hi> The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecter</hi> ſays, <hi>Becauſe you ſay my Character is made up of falſe apprehenſions, ignorant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Miſtakes.</hi> What difference is here in ſenſe at all? And what difference even in words; ſave that I add <hi>falſe apprehenſions,</hi> which the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> likewiſe has in the very next page? Neither of us mention <hi>all</hi> or <hi>ſome,</hi> which the <hi>Replyer,</hi> not without reaſon, ſuſpects of craft. As the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> thereof meant, I aſſure him, I meant; the whole Character, if he meant ſo; and part only, if he meant no more: Nor did I ever think of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his Authority farther than he extended it himſelf. If the <hi>Replyer</hi> find any Art in this, I for my part, find no diſhoneſty; and think I have ill luck to fall into his bad opinion, for keeping preciſely to my Adverſaries ſenſe, and almoſt preciſely to his words.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Replyer</hi> comes after this with full Cry, and asks, what is <hi>the meaning of all this pother and noiſe about this double Character of a Papiſt Miſ-repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and Repreſented?</hi> Truely I cannot tell, and think he would do well to ask thoſe who make it; for they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56115:3"/>
in all likely-hood know beſt. I for my part thought it a very inoffenſive thing, to let people know what <hi>Papiſts</hi> are, and pray God there be not a fear they ſhould appear what they are, leaſt they be found to be unlike what they are made appear. They have been cry'd out upon, for keeping the people in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their Doctrines; and when they expoſe them to open view, 'tis ſtrange there ſhould be a noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Truly I did not expect it, and I could not imagine a bare Narrative of matter of Fact ſhould fructifie into <hi>Anſwers,</hi> and <hi>Reflections,</hi> and <hi>Replies.</hi> I did but relate, playing the Hiſtorian, not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertiſt: Not but that, with the liberty of Hiſtorians, who deliver their own judgment of the matters they relate, and their reaſons for it, I diſcover'd what I thought, and ſometimes ſaid briefly why: But every Body will ſee, I made not Diſputing my buſineſs. And yet, I know not how, it is taken it ſeems, for a piece of Controverſie, and which is more unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, againſt the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and defences made for her, as if my <hi>Miſ-repreſented Papiſt,</hi> were a <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Church of England Proteſtant:</hi> Whenas I never gave that Character out for a <hi>Church of England</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Popery,</hi> thought nothing of her Rule or Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor dreamt of concerning her, or any Body in my Miſ-repreſentation, whoſe Conſcience do's not of it ſelf concern them. All thoſe, who have ſuch Idea's of us, as I there draw, I ſaid Miſ-repreſent us; and to thoſe who have not, I ſaid nothing. He that would know whether he be concern'd or no, has but to ask his own Heart, to which I did then, and do ſtill leave him.</p>
            <p>And yet notwithſtanding this harmleſs juſtifying our ſelves, there is a <hi>pother</hi> and <hi>noiſe</hi> it ſeems about
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56115:4"/>
the <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented and Repreſented,</hi> and it is as fiercely aſſaulted on every ſide, as if it came to declare open war, and bid defiance to the world. The <hi>Anſwerer</hi> ſet upon it in the <hi>Miſ-repeſenting</hi> part, and will have that to be <hi>falſe apprehenſions</hi> of the Author, to be <hi>taken from his ignorant, Childiſh or Wilful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes:</hi> And then the <hi>Papiſt Repreſented</hi> he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to overthrow with whole vollies of Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now comes the <hi>Replier,</hi> and tho he makes it wonderful hard <hi>(p.</hi> 40.) to know what the Faith of a Papiſt is; yet he acknowledges it in the ſame page to be true, as the Repreſenter has declar'd it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſome few points; and therefore paſſing by the <hi>Papiſt Repreſented</hi> with ſome light touches only, his main attack is againſt the <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented:</hi> and not being willing this ſhould be underſtood, as if made up of Childiſh, Ignorant or Wilful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, he will have it to be the very avow'd Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine <note place="margin">p. 3.</note> and Practice of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> He will have the <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented and Repreſented</hi> to be all the ſame, excepting ſome very few caſes.</p>
            <p>And this he has urg'd ſo far, that I think, 'tis not now ſo much my Perſonal concern, to make an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> as the concern of as many as throughout the whole World profeſs themſelves <hi>Catholicks,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the truth of what is here charg'd againſt them. The Salvation of their Souls, their Eternity is at ſtake. If what is here poſitively aſſerted againſt them be true, 'tis high time for them to reform, and to leave off the Doctrine and Practice of ſo much Heatheniſm, under a Chriſtian Name. <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in hopes of a mutual condeſcendence, may flatter them as they pleaſe, and tell them, they have Charity enough to think they may be ſaved; for my part I declare, if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56115:4"/>
               <hi>Popery</hi> be guilty of what he ſays, it cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my thoughts, there's any room for it in Heaven: and that there's any more poſſibility of a paſſage for its monſtrous extravagancies through the <hi>Narrow way,</hi> then for thoſe of <hi>Barbary</hi> and <hi>Turky.</hi> The <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> this Author deſcribes, ſeems to me a flat Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Commandments and the Goſpel; and the Profeſſors of it can have no other portion then with Idolaters, Murderers and Adulterers, whoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity is to be in utter darkneſs.</p>
            <p>He declares plainly that <hi>Popery</hi> is really that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Religion,</hi> which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay it is; that it teaches and practices all thoſe Fopperies, Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Non-ſence, which have been at any time charg'd againſt it by <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> His very Title of <hi>A Papiſt not Miſ-repreſented by Proteſtants,</hi> is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Religion to all thoſe horrid ſhapes and monſtrous forms, it has been at any time expos'd in by Members of the Reformation. He tells his Reader in the name of all his Brethren, <hi>We charge them</hi> (the Papiſts) <hi>with nothing, but what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>profeſs to believe, and what they practice:</hi> And in this one Aſſertion vouches for the Truth of all that Infamy, and prophaneſs which is laid at their doors. And ſo gives aſſurance, that their complaint of being Miſ-repreſented is but vain and idle; for that, what they call a <hi>Miſ-repreſentation,</hi> is in reality a <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation in all the material Points, of the avow'd Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine and Practice of the Church of Rome.</hi> That the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Repreſented</hi> (excepting ſome very few caſes) profeſſes to believe all that the <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented</hi> is charg'd with. This <hi>the beſt and wiſeſt Men,</hi> he ſays <hi>(viz.</hi> of the Reformation) <hi>have believ'd of them.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 2.</note> And <hi>in</hi> Fox's <hi>book of Martyrs we read how many were</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56115:5"/>
               <hi>burnt for not believing, as the Papiſt Miſ-repreſented believes.</hi> This is the General Character of a <hi>Papiſt</hi> according to the freſheſt and moſt Modern draught of our <hi>Adverſary;</hi> So that now to receive a true infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the <hi>Papiſt's Creed,</hi> we are not to conſult the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or the Catechiſm <hi>ad Parochos,</hi> but the writings and Sermons of <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> For however <hi>Papiſts</hi> may not know what they believe themſelves; yet <hi>Proteſtants</hi> give a true and exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, and are ſo far Infallible, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> certainly are, what they ſay they are; believe what they ſay they believe, ſince <hi>they charge them with nothing, but what they expreſly profeſs to believe, and what they practice.</hi> Upon the aſſurance of this <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavit,</hi> me-thinks, 'twill not be amiſs here to receive the ſatisfaction of knowing, what a <hi>Papiſt</hi> really is, and what he certainly believes, beyond the poſſibility of all exception. For ſince all that proceeds from a Popiſh hand of this nature, is ſuſpected and challeng'd, and the <hi>double Character of a Papiſt Miſ-repreſented and Repreſented</hi> (about which, as the <hi>Repliers</hi> ſays, there is ſo <hi>much pother and noiſe)</hi> is queſtioned as to its Method, its Sincerity and exactneſs, we'l now follow our Authors call, and learn what <hi>Popery</hi> is, from the Pens of <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> and eſpecially from ſome of thoſe, who are ſupposed to know what <hi>Popery</hi> is; but for the <hi>bad man,</hi> which the <hi>Replier</hi> excepts againſt, we'l make no advantage of him, but let a better <note place="margin">P. 3.</note> Man take his room.</p>

                        <p>That to become a Monk or a Nun, is as good as the Sacrament of Baptiſm.</p>
                        <p>That Whoredom is allowed all the Year long, and another ſin for <hi>June, July, Auguſt,</hi> which you muſt not know: Allowed for this time by <hi>Sixtus Quartus</hi> to all the Family of the Cardinals of St. <hi>Lucie.</hi>

They place divers counterfeit Books, diſguiſed under the Name of ſome of the Apoſtles, or their Diſciples, full of Fables, Blaſphemies, and Contrarieties, and yet commend them to the World as parcels of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word of God, and Believe in them as Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf, as the Goſpels of St. <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas, &amp;c.</hi>

They teach novelties and falſe Doctrines concerning the very grounds of Faith; for they believe the Church to be built upon the Pope.</p>

                        <p>They give the Office of Chriſt's mediation to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> to Angels and to Saints, they make alſo Saints our Redeemers <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For God they Worſhip Creatures, not only giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour to the Sacrament, but alſo to Crucifixes and Images of the Trinity made of Wood <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they do adore not only Saints, but rotten bones and rags, they know not of whom.</p>
                        <p>They overthrow grace and aſcribe the merit of our ſalvation, not to God's mercy through Chriſt, nor to the merit of his paſſion, but <hi>properly</hi> to our own works and merits.</p>
                        <p>They cut out the Second commandment, becauſe it cannot ſtand with the Popiſh worſhip of Images.</p>
                        <p>They pray before Stocks and Stones, nay they put <hi>their truſt</hi> in them.</p>
                        <p>They make no conſcience to cut Chriſtian mens throats for not yielding to all their abominations, and think it conſcience to obey the Popes decrees, tho very unlawful.</p>
                        <p>The Fourth commandment concerneth the ſanctifying the Sabbath, but the Papiſts profane it by Worſhiping Idols, and frequenting the Idolatrous Maſs.</p>
                        <p>Papiſts think they do God good ſervice when they murder true Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>Amongſt Papiſts, Adultery and Fornication are reckoned among leſſer ſins.</p>

                        <p>Papiſts blaſphemouſly make Chriſt not only a deſperate Man without hope, but alſo an infidel without Faith.</p>

                        <p>Papiſts do diminiſh the merit of Chriſt's ſatisfaction; and enervate, as much as in them lieth, the Croſs of Chriſt, and the effect of his death and paſſion—They are teachers of Antichriſt, oppoſite to Chriſt, and enemies of his Croſs.</p>
                        <p>That Chriſt is not the redeemer of all Man-kind.</p>
                        <p>They make Chriſt inferiour to Saints and Angels, and prefer the Pope before Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Papiſts make St. <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Dominick,</hi> equal to Chriſt in divers things, and in ſome things Superiour.</p>
                        <p>They give equal honour to a Croſs of Wood and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and to Chriſt, and looking on a Wooden crucifix they ſay, thou haſt redeem'd us.</p>

                        <p>Papiſts believe divers were by their Saints fetch'd out of Hell.</p>
                        <p>Papiſts by their irregular Doctrines and Traditions, have not only corrupted, but alſo diſanul'd, for the moſt part, the law of God.</p>
                        <p>They deny the Goſpel to be a rule of perfection, but they doubt not to give that honour to the rules of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, &amp;c.</hi> they ſpeak more Blaſphemouſly of the Holy Scriptures, then the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Saracens.</hi>

To the Images of the Croſs and crucifix, they give as much honour as they do to God.</p>

                        <p>Papiſts ſay they put no truſt in Images, but never did the Gentiles truſt ſo much in the Images of <hi>Juno</hi> or <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as the Papiſts truſt in the Images of our Lady of <hi>Loretto, James</hi> of <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>They give divine honour to Images, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot deny to be Idolatrous.</p>
                        <p>They aſcribe mans juſtification to his Works, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude juſtification, both by Chriſt's iuſtice, and by Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Papiſts teach their diſciples to diſtruſt Gods grace—and to truſt rather in their own Works and Merits.</p>
                        <p>Popery is nothing elſe, but a pack of old and new Hereſies.</p>
                        <p>Papiſts deſpiſe marriage as Pollutions and fleſhly life.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bennet, Dominick, Francis</hi> and other authors of feigned religions took not their Rules from the Goſpel, but thought they could frame a more perfect religion then the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>As the Gentiles had one principal God, and divers demy and inferior Gods, ſo have the Papiſts.</p>
                        <p>As the Gentiles believed that every one had his good and bad Genius, ſo the Papiſts aſſign to every Chriſtian a good and bad Angel.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Council of <hi>Arles cap. 23.</hi> ſheweth it to be a cuſtom of Pagans, to worſhip Trees or Stones, or

                        <p>The Papiſt Preachers ſeldom teach the people, and when they do it, they preach their own inventions, and tell idle tales without edification.</p>
                        <p>Both Prieſts and People are moſt ignorant of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, where Popery is profes'd.</p>

                        <p>In a member of the Catholick Church, (they ſay) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inward Faith nor other vertue is requir'd, but only that he profeſs outwardly the Romiſh Religion, and be ſubject to the Pope.</p>
                        <p>The Papiſts promiſe Heaven to their followers, ſo they profeſs and ſet forward the Popes cauſe, whether they be Murderers of Kings, or Maſſacrers, or Robels, or filthy Whoremongers, or Sodomites.</p>
                        <p>They make more conſcience to abſtain from fleſh on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> then to murder Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>Divers points of Popiſh doctrine are ſpecially ſaid to proceed from the Devil.</p>
                        <p>It is a common practice amongſt Papiſts to give divine Worſhip to dead men.</p>

What neceſſity of keeping up Names of Diviſion? <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> may now ſhake hands, and by one Subſcription cloſe into a Body, and joyn in a fair and amicable correſpondence. <hi>Popery</hi> has been hitherto the only
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56115:10"/>
cauſe of Separation; one part ſeeming to avow and ſupport it, the other as Zealouſly endeavouring its overthrow. And all the ſtrife it ſeems has been about a <hi>Word.</hi> For now we have been inform'd from <hi>Great and Good Authorities,</hi> what this <hi>Popery</hi> is; what Papiſt in the World is there, that will not ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> as to give his hand for the utter ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing <hi>this kind</hi> of <hi>Popery?</hi> And when <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> concur for the rooting out of <hi>Popery,</hi> what poſſibility of Farther Diviſions?</p>
            <p>But if on the other ſide, <hi>this Character</hi> of a <hi>Papiſt</hi> be intended, for the ſetting forth the Doctrines and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> if this be deſign'd as a <hi>True Repreſentation</hi> of the Faith and Religion of <hi>Roman Catholicks:</hi> Then returns afreſh my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of their being <hi>Miſ-repreſented;</hi> that they ſuffer under the greateſt injuſtice imaginable; that they are expos'd in <hi>Bears</hi> and <hi>Tigers</hi> Skins, ſo to become a Bugbear to the Multitude: That they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign'd and render'd odious for the maintaining ſuch Doctrines, which they as heartily Deteſt, as thoſe that urge the charge; and that 'tis no wonder that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> are put in the Liſt with <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> ſince their Religion is thus injuriouſly loaded with Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and they made the Profeſſors of ſuch Tenets, which bid open defiance to Truth, Honeſty, and Chriſtianity, which ſtrike at the Worlds Redeemer, and are impoſſible to be entertain'd by any Creature, that is one degree above a Beaſt.</p>
            <p>I will not deny, but whoſoever will look into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the <hi>Scavanger</hi> does into the City, who ſtops no where but at a Dunghil, may rake to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo much as to defame her with the Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and Unwary; alas the Vices of Men in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56115:10"/>
their abuſes of the moſt Sacred things, too abundantly furniſh matter of this kind. But yet whoſoever ſhall expoſe this for the Doctrine and Practiſe of their Church, and deſcribe her, and all in her Communion by theſe Rubbiſh Collections, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly avoid the ſcandal of being unjuſt, and might with as good reaſon decipher <hi>London</hi> by thoſe loathſome heaps where all her filth is emptied. And now ſince 'tis evident, the Adverſaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do generally thus deal by her, ſcraping out of every corner of that vaſt Communion and in every Age, whatſoever can poſſibly contribute to make her infamous; there is too too much reaſon to complain of her being <hi>Miſ-repreſented,</hi> and no juſt exception can be made againſt the Character of the <hi>Papiſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented,</hi> which lays open to the World the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of theſe unwarrantable proceedings.</p>
            <p>But here now ſtrikes in the <hi>Replyer,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to explain a Myſtery in this Character; and the <hi>Reflecter,</hi> he ſays, <hi>will have no reaſon to glory, that he gave the occaſion of it.</hi> And this Myſtery it ſeems, <note place="margin">P. 3.</note> are ſome faults he has diſcover'd in the <hi>Miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> He ſays ſuch things are put into this Character of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as <hi>no Man in his wits ever charg'd them with:</hi> And yet thoſe very things almoſt in expreſs terms, and others far more abſur'd, we ſee charg'd (as is ſhew'd above) <hi>by the Beſt and Wiſeſt of Men, of great and good Authority</hi> with the <hi>Replyer,</hi> as he confeſſes himſelf. <hi>(p.</hi> 2.) And this too is to me a Myſtery as well as to him; that what no Man in his wits ever urg'd, and what the former <hi>Anſwerer</hi> calls <hi>Childiſh,</hi> and <hi>Ignorant,</hi> or <hi>Willful miſtakes</hi> ſhould be now ſeen Father'd upon Men of ſo high a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:56115:11"/>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> and <hi>3ly.</hi> He complains, that the Opinions of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the conſequences they draw from <note place="margin">P. 4, 5.</note> Popiſh Doctrines, are put into the Character of a <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented,</hi> as if they were his avow'd Doctrine and Belief. This is a pretty ſpeculative quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, I confeſs, and might deſervedly find room here, were it our buſineſs to conſider the due method of <hi>Miſ-repreſentation</hi> in the <hi>abſtract:</hi> But as our preſent concern ſtands, here's a quaint conceit loſt, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a wrong place. For what had the Author of the <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented</hi> to do with theſe Rules? He did not intend to Miſ-repreſent any body. His Province was only to draw forth the Character of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as 'tis commonly apprehended by the Vulgar, or the Multitude, with the common prejudices and miſtakes that generally attend ſuch a notion. Now I would fain know, whether this Character, as it lies in the peoples heads, is diſtinguiſh'd into <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents</hi> and <hi>Conſequents:</hi> Whether they, when they hear one declaiming againſt Popery, <hi>for committing Idolatry, as bad or worſe than that of the groſſeſt Heathens, Worſhipping Stocks and Stones for God,</hi> diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and theſe <hi>Interpretations</hi> and <hi>Conſequences</hi> charg'd againſt it. Alas they ſwallow all down greedily and in the lump; <hi>Antecedents</hi> and <hi>Conſequents</hi> go down with them all at once. Neither do I find much care us'd to prevent this miſunderſtanding in the People. For who is there in laying open the folly, as they will have it of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and poſitively charging them, that <hi>They make Gods of Stocks and Stones,</hi> that <hi>They make Gods of dead Men, and raiſe the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>to be co-partner with Chriſt in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Does af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards tell his Auditory, that This is not what the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56115:11"/>
Papiſts themſelves <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Teach;</hi> but only what himſelf <hi>Believes</hi> and <hi>Infers</hi> from their Doctrine, as the <hi>Conſequence</hi> or <hi>Interpretation</hi> of it, but they deny.</p>
            <p>Truly were our Adverſaries ſo ſincere as to tell their hearers, that all their charge againſt <hi>Popery</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than what they <hi>think</hi> of our Faith and Doctrine; I would ſo far agree with the <hi>Replier,</hi> that this ought not be call'd Miſ-repreſenting, but only ſaying of us, what is not true. But they go beyond this, and inſtead of ſaying <hi>we think ſo,</hi> they poſitively ſay <hi>ſo it is:</hi> And poſſeſs as many as take Ideas from their words, not barely that they think we Teach and Practice Idolatry, <hi>v.g.</hi> but abſolutely, that we do. Nay our Image-worſhip, is Worſhiping Stocks and Stones for Gods, ſays the <hi>Replier</hi> in his very next leaf without remembring his <hi>thinking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when the People read Books, intended as <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives</hi> againſt the danger of <hi>Popery,</hi> they are ſtill expos'd to the like deceit. For what ordinary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is there, that finds it poſitively aſſerted as above by the Arch-biſhop of <hi>York. Papiſts Believe the Church of Rome, whether it teach true or falſe. And if the Pope Believes there is no Life to come, they muſt Believe it, as an Article of their Faith.</hi> What or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Reader, I ſay, is there, that will not ſwallow this preſently as the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> when at latter end 'tis only what he <hi>thinks,</hi> and a <hi>Conſequence</hi> far fetch'd to diſcredit <hi>Popery</hi> with the Vulgar? And when he's told by another hand, that the Common Anſwer of <hi>Catholicks to excuſe themſelves from Idolatry in their adoration of the Euchariſt, is becauſe they Believe the Bread to be God:</hi> Has not he here a fair occaſion again of taking this for the <hi>Belief</hi> of a Papiſt; and that he Worſhips, what he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56115:12"/>
               <hi>Believes</hi> to be a <hi>Breaden God?</hi> Certainly he muſt be no ſmall <hi>Logician</hi> that can diſcover, whether this be an <hi>Antecedent</hi> or <hi>Conſequent,</hi> whether it be the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or only a <hi>Conſequence</hi> of it. For my part, when I ſee <hi>Popery</hi> deſcrib'd, as if none could be of that Communion, but he <hi>that can bring his mind to Believe the Word of God to be writ but for a few Years only, and afterwards to be abrogated and annull'd. That whatſoever God ſays, ſhall be null and void, unleſs the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>will and command the ſame.</hi> When I hear that the <hi>Pope</hi> is Antichriſt, and <hi>Rome</hi> the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that <hi>the Papiſts have taken away from the People the Holy Communion, the Word of God, the true Worſhip of the Deity, the right uſe of the Sacraments and Prayers, and inſtead of them, have given to pleaſe them, Salt, water, Oyl, Spittle, Bulls, Jubilees, Indulgences, Croſſes, Incenſe and an infinite number of meer Toys and Baubles, and that in theſe they have placed all Religion;</hi> when I hear, I ſay, <hi>Popery</hi> thus deſcrib'd to the People by eminent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logizers for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I cannot conceive, but 'tis to let them know, what notion to frame of it. And yet whoſoever ſhall ſuppoſe, that after ſuch directions, they'l conceive a regular Idea of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a confuſion of <hi>Faith</hi> with its <hi>Interpretations,</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> with its <hi>charges,</hi> muſt conclude them to be better at <hi>Separating</hi> than the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> and that in ſubtle <hi>diſtinctions</hi> they are able to outdo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf. But 'tis too much to be fear'd, that thoſe who expoſe <hi>Popery</hi> to the People after this way, are not willing they ſhould apprehend it in its genuine Purity, and as free from this diſingenuous mixture: 'Tis ſo like thoſe who impoſe upon the Multitude with artificial Monſters, by putting the wrong end for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56115:12"/>
and ſhewing the Tail for the Head; that if they are not deluded into a miſtake, 'tis becauſe they are not ſo credulous as they ſhould be, and ſuſpect ſomething of a Trick in him that makes the ſhew.</p>
            <p>And has not the <hi>Reflecter</hi> now reaſon to repent after all, that he gave occaſion to the <hi>Replier</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the Myſteries, he has diſcover'd in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented;</hi> ſince the faults he endeavours to lay open, are not in the Miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, but in thoſe, who by Miſ-repreſenting the Papiſt, rais'd a falſe Idea of Popery in the Peoples heads? The Character of the <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented,</hi> was intended only, as the Author expreſſes himſelf in his Introduction, for a <hi>Copy</hi> of Popery as Painted in the Imagination of the Vulgar: And being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to that, 'tis exact and perfect: And if there be any faults in it, the blame muſt fall on thoſe who drew the <hi>Original.</hi> But however we'l compound here again for this; if the <hi>Replier</hi> will but undertake to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the People, and give them a more exact Notion of Popery, the <hi>Reflecter</hi> will undertake to reform the Character accordingly. But till then the Character of the <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented</hi> ſtands good; and till the abus'd people are taught to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Antecedents</hi> and <hi>Conſequents,</hi> between the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Conſequences</hi> charg'd againſt it; the Character muſt remain as it is; and any Reformation in it would but make it irregular, and unlike that from whence it was taken. The <hi>Replier</hi> therefore might very well have ſpar'd the almoſt Forty pages he has ſpent on this Subject; in which, tho he has learnedly diſtinguiſh'd between matters of Diſpute and of Repreſentation: Yet this diſtinction being not to be found in the Notion the People have of Popery,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56115:13"/>
'tis nothing to our purpoſe. And the only end it can poſſibly ſerve for, is to let the World underſtand, how much the Papiſts are generally wrong'd in their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; whilſt ſo many groſſe abſurdities, which are often poſitively expos'd for Articles of their Faith, are here acknowledg'd by the <hi>Replier</hi> himſelf, not to be their <hi>Faith,</hi> but only the Interpretations and <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential charges</hi> of their Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the <hi>Miſ-repreſenting</hi> Arts and Faults he mentions. For the <hi>Repreſenting</hi> Faults he alledges. 1. <hi>That I deny the Belief of their Interpretations.</hi> And the reaſon is, it may be, becauſe he thinks, no body charges us with <hi>that Belief:</hi> Which if it be but true, then I have not ſo much as contradicted any body, and there is no fault, I hope, in that. 2. <hi>I generally own the Doctrines and Practices, which they charge us with.</hi> And how could this poſſibly be otherwiſe, if they charge us with none, but what we expreſly profeſs to own? 3. <hi>That in ſome caſes I diſown that to be the Doctrine and Belief of our Church, which manifeſtly is ſo and has been prov'd on them.</hi> Then for all his word to the contrary, we are in ſome caſes charg'd with more than we expreſly profeſs to Believe. As for his <hi>manifeſtly,</hi> and his <hi>proving,</hi> let that go for no more than what it is, his Opinion: 'Tis none of mine, and I think 'twill be no bodies elſe, when the matter comes to a Trial.</p>
            <p>And here now we muſt turn over ſo many Leaves, till we meet with ſome other matter in the <hi>Reply.</hi> And the firſt that occurs, are ſome exceptions againſt the Rule obſerv'd by the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> in declaring the Faith of a Papiſt, who to clear himſelf from the Scandal of Interpreting the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> by his own private ſenſe and opinion, alledges the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56115:13"/>
               <hi>Catechiſm ad Parochos,</hi> which he had follow'd in delivering the ſenſe of the <hi>Council.</hi> This the <hi>Replier</hi> could not paſs by without an Anſwer, and therefore gives a ſatisfactory one. <hi>And is he ſure,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that all his Repreſentations are conformable to the ſenſe of this Catechiſm? May he not play tricks with the Catechiſm, and expound that by a private Spirit, as well as the Council?</hi> Thus a Queſtion or two is a full Confutation of the <hi>Reflecter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alledg'd again the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Doctrine of the Catholick Church,</hi> which being approv'd and atteſted by the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, by ſeveral Cardinals and Biſhops, brought along with it the Authority of the <hi>See Apoſtolick.</hi> But this it ſeems, works nothing upon the <hi>Replier: Canus</hi> has put a ſcruple in his head; and becauſe he finds in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that <hi>That is not to be accounted the judgment of the Apoſtolick See, which is given only by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>privately, maliciouſly,</hi> (a word ſlipt over by the <hi>Replier) and inconſiderately, or with the advice only of ſome few of his own mind;</hi> he cannot therefore think, but that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s <hi>Expoſition</hi> comes ſhort of the Authority of the <hi>Apoſtolick See;</hi> and that the <hi>Reflecter</hi> is out, in taking ſhelter under one, whoſe <hi>Authority is nothing,</hi> as he ſays down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, <hi>pag.</hi> 46.</p>
            <p>This is Anſwering I confeſs with a witneſs, thus to endeavour to overthrow ſo conſiderable and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend an Authority, without any Authority at all, beſides that of an ungrounded and ill-turn'd conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe that is not to be accounted the Judgment of the Apoſtolick See, which is given only by the Pope, <hi>privately, maliciouſly, and inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or with the advice only of ſome few of his own mind;</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:56115:14"/>
therefore this Learned Prelate's <hi>Expoſition of the Catholick Faith</hi> is to be thrown by, as of no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. So that our <hi>Replier,</hi> has here concluded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more adoe, that the approbation of this Book was only given <hi>privately, maliciouſly, inconſiderately,</hi> or elſe with the advice only of ſome few of the Popes own mind, otherwiſe the Conſequence will not hold. But to ſhew how little the <hi>Replier</hi> has weighed this matter, and with how little pains he can undervalue any thing when he pleaſes: I need only remit the Reader to the peruſal of the Book it ſelf, which is lately publiſhed in Engliſh; the <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements</hi> affixt to it will ſatisfie him, that there has not a Book appear'd in this Age ſupported by greater Authority than This. He'l find it examin'd with all due deliberation, approv'd with all ſolennity imaginable, by Men of known Integrity, Piety and Learning, by Abbots, Cardinals, Biſhops, and by this preſent Pope himſelf, and recommended by his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> to be Read by all the Faithful. He'l find it not only thus approv'd, but even twice Printed at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, and in the Preſs of the Congregation <hi>de Propaganda Fide,</hi> Tranſlated out of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal French, into divers Languages, as <hi>Latin, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Engliſh, Iriſh, Flemiſh, High-Dutch,</hi> and this done by eminent Men of theſe Nations: So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Atteſtations of thoſe great Men there ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, it may be ſaid to have the General Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all theſe Catholick Prelates, who in propoſing it to their Flock, ſufficiently recommend it for a True Expoſition of the Doctrine of the Catholick Church. And yet notwithſtanding all this, with the <hi>Replier,</hi> it has not the Authority of the <hi>Apoſtolick See;</hi> nay its <hi>Authority is</hi> juſt <hi>nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:56115:14"/>
Now methinks, I would willingly here know of the <hi>Replier,</hi> whether Thoſe <hi>Great and Good Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities</hi> above mention'd, who pretend to make a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the Faith and Doctrines of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> have better Authority and Grounds for what they aſſert and charge, than this Reverend Prelate for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which he gives. And whether it be not a great Myſtery, that every <hi>Divine</hi> of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be thought to have Authority ſufficient, for defaming the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with whatſoever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Opinions he can but find in one or two Writers of what condition ſoever: And yet a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Prelate,</hi> Eminent in the Church for his great Vertue and Learning, in expounding the Faith of his Church, with the Conſent, Approbation, and Authority of the Greateſt Men of his Communion, and even of his Supream Paſtor, ſhall be ſlighted, and thrown by as of <hi>no Authority</hi> at all. For my part I cannot underſtand this uneven kind of juſtice, and reaſoning: Or why thoſe who profeſs a Religion, and depend on it as to their Salvation, ſhall be thought leſs to underſtand it, than others who proteſt againſt it, and look no farther into't, than to render it Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. But it muſt be ſo in an Age, in which a <hi>Papiſt</hi> is not to paſs for a Chriſtian, and muſt not be believ'd; we'l therefore go on to the other points.</p>
            <p>And for the clearing the moſt material of them, we need not look beyond the Expoſition deliver'd by this <hi>Prelate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> As to the <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> he declares ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that They have no other capacity of aſſiſting us, <hi>but only by their Prayers.</hi> And tho the <hi>Replier</hi> pretends, there's no ſuch limitation found in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; yet methinks he ſhould not have been ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56115:15"/>
in a caſe, in which he's ſo eaſily diſprov'd. The French Edition Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> 1681. has it expreſly, <hi>pag.</hi> 32. The Firſt Engliſh Edition Printed likewiſe in <hi>Paris</hi> 1672. <hi>pag.</hi> 29. And now this laſt Correct Edition, which came forth the laſt Week, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. So that, tho the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> has made ſome little objection; yet the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> is ſufficiently vindicated, in thus declaring the Faith of a Papiſt: ſince what he ſaid, is founded not upon his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſenſe, but upon an Authority beyond all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beſides that of meer <hi>Cavil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> And <hi>3ly.</hi> As to the <hi>Popes perſonal Infallibility,</hi> and the <hi>Depoſing Power,</hi> the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> declar'd, that, tho there were Men of his Communion maintaining theſe Points by way of <hi>Opinion,</hi> yet that they were no part of the <hi>Catholick Faith;</hi> and that <hi>Papiſts</hi> had no obligation from their <hi>Church</hi> of aſſenting to ſuch Doctrines. And for thus delivering a matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> he has the Authority again of this Great <hi>Prelate,</hi> who having declar'd the <hi>Primacy</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and acknowledg'd the ſame in his Succeſſors in the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> immediately adds: <hi>As for thoſe things, which we know are diſputed of in the Schools, tho the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">New Edit. p. 50.</note> 
               <hi>Miniſters continually alledge them to render this Power odious, it is not neceſſary we ſpeak of them here, ſeeing they are not Articles of the Catholick Faith. It is ſufficient we acknowledge a Head eſtabliſh'd by God to conduct his whole Flock in his Paths, which thoſe, who love Concord amongſt Brethren, and Eccleſiaſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanimity, will moſt willingly acknowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is not this a ſufficient diſcharge of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenter</hi> from all the exceptions of his Adverſaries? For if this learned Author, having propos'd the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of St. <hi>Peters Chair</hi> to be acknowledg'd as the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56115:15"/>
common Center of all Catholick Union, do's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely wave all other Points relating to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that <hi>Chair,</hi> as being <hi>no part of the Catholick Faith:</hi> And his Book in this form is own'd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, by the moſt eminent of the Cardinals, and other great Prelates of the Churh after a moſt ſtrict examination, what ground of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> in his following this ſo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick a Rule? 'Twas the main deſign of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> in that Treatiſe to ſeparate the opinions of Divines and School Debates, from the Doctrine of the Catholick Faith. And ſince he omitted to expound thoſe Points of the Popes <hi>Perſonal Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> and the <hi>Depoſing Power</hi> as not belonging to the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> with ſo full and Authentick an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, as has been declared; where is the crime of the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> in not allowing them a place in that Liſt?</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but run the venture of another ſmile from the <hi>Replier,</hi> upon the reinforcement of my former Propoſal. I deſir'd that the deciſion of the quarrel with the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> might depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the experiment of any ones being judg'd capable of being receiv'd into the Catholick Church, upon his aſſenting to matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> in that form as deliver'd by the <hi>Repreſenter.</hi> The <hi>Replier,</hi> having ſmil'd firſt, thought it not fit to put it to that iſſue; but choſe rather to own that the Faith, as declar'd by the <hi>Repreſenter,</hi> was really the Faith of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting <note place="margin">p. 40.</note> the <hi>Depoſing Doctrine,</hi> and ſome other few Points. Here then let him make the Propoſed Trial, if he pleaſes, or any friend for him; and if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his refuſal to admit the <hi>Depoſing Doctrine</hi> and the <hi>Popes Infallibility,</hi> but as Stated by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenter</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56115:16"/>
(that is, not as Articles of Catholick Faith) he be not judg'd ſufficiently qualified as to thoſe points, to be receiv'd into the Communion of the Roman Catholicks, I will grant he has reaſon to charge the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> not to have done his part in thoſe Particulars. This will be a much ſhorter and ſurer Conviction then twenty <hi>Anſwers</hi> and <hi>Replies,</hi> fit only to caſt a miſt before the Readers eyes, and which ſuch a tryal as this will quickly diſſipate.</p>
            <p>And this now is all that is requiſite for a full Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the <hi>Repreſenter.</hi> For it being franckly own'd by the <hi>Replier</hi> himſelf, that he has made a <note place="margin">p. 40.</note> 
               <hi>true Repreſentation</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> of a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> with the exception only of ſome few Points. And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here made evident, that what the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd as to thoſe very Points, is according to the ſenſe of the <hi>See Apoſtolick,</hi> of the greateſt Prelates, nay, I may ſay of the whole Church: <hi>The Papiſt Miſ-repreſented and Repreſented,</hi> ſtands untouch'd. And all that has been ſaid againſt it, have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then ſo many artificial endeavours to perſwade the World, that the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> underſtands better, what the <hi>Faith</hi> of a <hi>Papiſt</hi> is, then the <hi>Papiſt</hi> do's himſelf; which will be eaſily anſwer'd after his manner, with a ſmile.</p>
            <p>What the <hi>Replier</hi> adds after this, belongs not to the <hi>Repreſenter,</hi> who being to <hi>Repreſent,</hi> and not to <hi>Diſpute,</hi> is not concern'd with thoſe tedious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; however, not to be uncivil, we'l go ſo far with him, tho it be out of our way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He proves at large that all <hi>Definitions of Faith,</hi> declar'd in General Councils are not concluded with <hi>Anathema's;</hi> and in this we willingly agree with him: <note place="margin">p. 51.</note> But this do's not at all prove, that whatſoever is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56115:16"/>
declar'd in ſuch a Council without an <hi>Anathema,</hi> is an Article of Faith; and therefore nothing againſt us deſerving any farther anſwer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He endeavours to prove the <hi>Depoſing Power</hi> not to be a matter of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> but to <note place="margin">p. 53.</note> be a Point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and this from a Principle lately publiſhed in the vindication of Dr. <hi>Sherlock's</hi> Sermon, viz. that <hi>To decree what ſhall be done, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluds a virtual definition of that Doctrine on which that Decree is founded.</hi> And this he ſays, <hi>as we have been lately told.</hi> But what reſpect can I poſſibly have for what has been lately told us by another hand, ſince the <hi>Replier</hi> himſelf, however he urges it in one page, plainly undervalues it and contradicts it in his very next; where he tells us, that in the Council of <note place="margin">p. 55.</note> the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there was a <hi>Decree of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> yet <hi>it contain'd no Definition of Faith.</hi> And for my part I think the <hi>Replier</hi> in the right, and muſt needs ſtand with him againſt the <hi>Vindicator</hi> of the Sermon; that <hi>to decree what ſhall be done, do's not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a virtual Definition of Doctrine.</hi> And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample produc'd by the <hi>Replier</hi> evidently ſhews it: For tho the Apoſtles in their Council (Acts 15.) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed <hi>abſtinence from blood and ſtrangl'd meats:</hi> Yet this Decree of <hi>what was to be done,</hi> did not include a <hi>virtual Definition of that Doctrine, on which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was founded:</hi> For if it had, then the <hi>Doctrine of abſtaining from blood and ſtrangled meats,</hi> had been an <hi>Article of Faith;</hi> which I am ſure is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able either to the Principles or Practices of either of our Churches. And the reaſon of this may be, becauſe Decrees of <hi>what ſhall be done,</hi> are often made with relation to particular circumſtances, of <hi>time, perſons, place,</hi> &amp;c. and not built upon Definitions
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56115:17"/>
of <hi>Faith,</hi> but upon Prudential Motives, upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Opinions, upon the Teſtimonies and Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men; and ſo may be ſuſpended or quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated, as alſo confirm'd a new, or wholly chang'd, according to the alteration of Circumſtances: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all which can ſtand with Articles of <hi>Faith,</hi> which being the indiſpenſable Doctrine of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are not ſubject to change or alteration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſe this Decree to be rank'd only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Decreta Morum,</hi> which concern only the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline <note place="margin">p. 54.</note> and Government of the Church, yet our Adverſary here urges out of <hi>Canus</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that General Councils cannot err even in ſuch Decrees, when they relate to things neceſſary to Salvation, and concern the whole Church. And when the <hi>Replier</hi> has prov'd the <hi>Depoſing Decree</hi> to be of this Nature, and eſteem'd as ſuch by our Church, he may then deſerve a farther conſideration.</p>
            <p>What the Replier adds of this Subject <hi>(p.</hi> 57.) That the <hi>Pope</hi> permits the poſitive Aſſertors of the <hi>no-Depoſing Power</hi> to paſs without any Cenſure of Hereſie, becauſe he <hi>wants Power to do it,</hi> is ſpoke like an <hi>Oracle</hi> I confeſs; but becauſe theſe are ceas'd now a days, we may very well ſuſpend our aſſent, till we have ſome better Argument, than his bare aſſurance of what the Pope <hi>would do</hi> if he had Power.</p>
            <p>The Laſt Argument, is concerning the <hi>veneration</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 63.</note> 
               <hi>of Images.</hi> And tho the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> was willing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more ado, to condemn the Papiſts of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Idolatry</hi> from ſome external Acts of Adoration us'd before Images: Yet our <hi>Replier</hi> readily grants, that thoſe Actions are in themſelves <hi>indifferent and capable of being paid to God and Men,</hi> and to be us'd as the expreſſions either of a <hi>Civil</hi> or a <hi>Religious</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56115:17"/>
Honour. But he has given us an infallible Mark, by which to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> Honour, notwithſtanding the very <hi>ſame External</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 66.</note> 
               <hi>Actions</hi> being us'd in both; and 'tis, that <hi>Civil relates to this World,</hi> and <hi>Religious to the Inviſible Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the next.</hi> This he ſays is a diſtinction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by all the reſt of Mankind; and though <hi>by all the reſt</hi> he ſeems willing to exclude me, yet ſince he has given his word for it, I'le come in for one of that number, at leſt ſo far as to ſuppoſe it. So that here we have it now laid down as a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple by common agreement, that <hi>External Actions of Honour</hi> paid to things relating to this World, is a <hi>Civil Honour, Reſpect, Veneration or Worſhip.</hi> And when they are paid to things relating to the inviſible Inhabitants of the next, 'tis a <hi>Religious Honour, Reſpect, Veneration, or Worſhip.</hi> And hence 'tis concluded by him, that theſe <hi>External Acts</hi> of Honour expreſs'd to any <hi>Image,</hi> that has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ſome Inviſible Being muſt of neceſſity be a <hi>Religious</hi> Honour. This is what the <hi>Replier</hi> proves, and we at preſent agree to. But if he thinks, as he ſays, that this <hi>puts an end to the Diſpute,</hi> I think him miſtaken, we being as yet only in the beginning. For tho it hence follows that Papiſts give a <hi>Religious</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Holy Images, yet till it be proved that <hi>all Religious</hi> Reſpect and Honour, is <hi>ſo a Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> as to make a <hi>God</hi> of the thing to which it is paid, at leſt <hi>conſtructively;</hi> he has not concluded Papiſts to be Idolaters, or guilty of conſtructive Idolatry; which is the thing he intended and undertook. And that he cannot poſſibly prove it from theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, without proving <hi>too much,</hi> and bringing himſelf in for a ſhare, I think may eaſily be made appear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56115:18"/>
For if Papiſts muſt be condemn'd of this conſtructive Idolatry, becauſe they uſe <hi>External Acts of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to an Image, which has a Relation to ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Being: muſt not all thoſe come into the ſame Liſt, who uſe the like <hi>External Acts of Adoration</hi> to other things, which have a like Relation to the ſame inviſible Being? What excuſe ſhall there be for him, who <hi>Bows</hi> to the <hi>Altar,</hi> or <hi>Communion Table,</hi> to the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. All theſe things Relate to the inviſible Inhabitants of the next World, and all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Acts expreſs'd to them muſt by conſequence be a <hi>Religious Worſhip:</hi> then, in the words of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier, If to Worſhip any Inviſible Being, be to give Divine Honours to it; then to be ſure, to Worſhip the thing Relating to ſuch an Inviſible Being, muſt be</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 67.</note> 
               <hi>Religious Worſhip alſo. For if the Worſhip be refer'd to that Inviſible Being, which the thing relates to, it cannot be Civil but Religious Honour;</hi> and whoſoever gives <hi>Religious Honour</hi> to a thing, do's immediately aſcribe Divinity to the object of that Worſhip, and in our <hi>Repliers</hi> Phraſe, by <hi>conſtruction of Fact</hi> is an Idolater.</p>
            <p>And now how many here are included in this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? Certainly as many as admit of any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reſpect beſides to God: Which yet the <hi>Replier</hi> himſelf was not unwilling <hi>(p.</hi> 60.) to give to Reliques, allowing a <hi>due Veneration and Religious Decency to the Bodies of Saints and Martyrs:</hi> And the Learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> is well enough diſpos'd to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">Def. p. 862. 603.</note> a <hi>Reverence and Religious Reſpect</hi> due to Sacred Places and Things. So that I believe the <hi>Replier</hi> has overſhot himſelf in this Argument: And that upon conſideration, he will admit of ſome <hi>Degrees</hi> in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,</hi> as well as in <hi>Civil</hi> Honour: And that every
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56115:18"/>
thing is not immediately ſet up for a <hi>God,</hi> which is Honoured with a Religious Reſpect, however this Honour may be ultimately terminated in God.</p>
            <p>And this thought now brings into my mind, a cloſe piece of Arguing us'd by the <hi>Replier,</hi> in urging this matter; and it lies thus: <hi>(p.</hi> 66.) <hi>Civil Reſpects are confin'd to this World;</hi> But <hi>we have no intercourſe with the other World, but what is Religious:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>as the different kinds and degrees of Civil Honour are diſtinguiſht by the ſight of the Object, to which they are paid, tho the External Acts are the ſame:</hi> So (ſays he) <hi>the moſt certain mark of diſtinction between Civil and Religious Worſhip is this, that the one relates to this World, the other to the inviſible Inhabitants of the next.</hi> Here we have a <hi>Conſequence</hi> and a <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,</hi> and both ſo excellent in their kinds, that if any better connexion can be found in them, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Monument</hi> and the <hi>May-pole,</hi> it muſt be by one, who has found one trick more in <hi>Logick,</hi> then ever <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> knew. If inſtead of his <hi>So</hi> in the end of his <hi>Concluſion,</hi> he had made this application, <hi>So are the different kinds and degrees of Religious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour diſtinguiſht by the Intention of the Givers, or by ſome viſible repreſentation, or determination of other circumſtances.</hi> This might have been infer'd with ſome dependance on the Premiſes: And by it we might have compounded for the matter in hand: but as the <hi>Replier</hi> has it, it neither proves, nor is any thing.</p>
            <p>Another Argument we have juſt before this, which proves again <hi>too much,</hi> and is ſo unlucky as not to harm us, without cutting the Throat of his own Cauſe: The ſorce of it may be thus expreſs'd: <hi>No intention can alter the nature of Actions, which are</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:56115:19"/>
               <hi>determin'd by a Divine or Humane Law;</hi> Therefore <hi>ſince the External Acts of kneeling or bowing to or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Image, are determinately forbidden by the Divine Law, the intention of doing no evil in them, cannot excuſe them from Sin.</hi> For do's not this as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely ſtrike at the <hi>Bowing down</hi> to the <hi>Altar,</hi> and <hi>Kneeling</hi> to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> as at us? For thoſe very <hi>Actions</hi> are part of the <hi>Divine Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Bowing down</hi> is the very <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Action exprefly forbid in the Commandment: And then, <hi>If there be any ſuch thing,</hi> (as the Replier ſays here) <hi>as External and Viſible Idolatry, it muſt conſiſt in External and Viſible Actions; for we can never know what Mens intentions are, but by their Actions; and then</hi> (ſays he) <hi>if Men do ſuch Actions as are Idolatrous, how can the intention excuſe them from Idolatry?</hi> So that by this way of reaſoning he can never throw us down, but we muſt fall <hi>both together.</hi> For tho the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or the <hi>Altar</hi> are not expreſs'd in the Commandment; yet ſince the <hi>External Action of Adoration</hi> is a <hi>Religious and Divine Worſhip</hi> (according to the Repliers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple before eſtabliſh'd) the <hi>Bowing down</hi> and <hi>Kneeling to them</hi> cannot be excus'd from the guilt of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Idolatry.</hi> And whatſoever hole the <hi>Replier</hi> can poſſibly find, to get out at with his <hi>Altar,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenter</hi> will eaſily follow him at the ſame with his <hi>Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that the <hi>Replier</hi> may ſee, how far his Argument concludes, I would fain know whether a <hi>Quaker</hi> might not as reaſonably make uſe of the ſame, for the juſtifying his <hi>Yea's</hi> and his <hi>Nay's,</hi> and his other points of <hi>Quakeriſm?</hi> For if he ſhould ſay; <hi>No intention can alter the Nature of Actions, which are determin'd by a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Divine or Humane Law:</hi> But <hi>Swear not at all, Neither</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 10.</note>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:56115:19"/>
               <hi>be ye called Maſters,</hi> and <hi>let your Communication be Yea, Yea, Nay, Nay,</hi> are Actions or things determined <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 37.</note> by the Divine Law: Therefore the <hi>Intention of doing no Evil in them</hi> cannot excuſe the doing otherwiſe then is there determin'd, from the guilt of ſin. This has equal force from a <hi>Quaker</hi> as from a <hi>Replier,</hi> and makes evident, that the ſame Arguments which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade to a <hi>Reformation</hi> from <hi>Popery,</hi> do upon the ſame grounds plead ſtill for a <hi>farther Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far have I follow'd the <hi>Replier</hi> beyond my buſineſs of <hi>Repreſenting,</hi> and I hope I have ſo far oblig'd him in it, that however he has Queſtion'd my <hi>Honeſty,</hi> he will not at leſt, now call me <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncivil.</hi> Before I take my leave, I will be ſo free as to offer him a Requeſt or two, which will not be thought unreaſonable, I hope, ſince he himſelf has put them into my Mouth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he will uſe his intereſt with <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to hold to what he ſays they do, and charge us with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what we expreſly Profeſs to Believe and Practice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they pick not up the Abuſes of ſome, the Vices and Cruelties of others, the odd Opinions of particular Authors, and hold theſe forth for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of our Church. And that in charging any Practices, they charge them upon no more then are concern'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That as often as they tell what they think of our <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> They would likewiſe at the ſame time inform their Hearers, that thoſe Thoughts are, as the Replier ſays, <hi>Opinions, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations</hi> and <hi>Conſequences,</hi> of their own, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Doctrine, and not our <hi>avow'd Doctrine:</hi> But that we think as ill of thoſe Crimes which they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56115:20"/>
charge, as they themſelves do; and that We, our Doctrine and Practices, are as free from them, as They think of their own; and that in <hi>this</hi> conſiſts the Difference betwixt us.</p>
            <p>Theſe are but very Reaſonable Requeſts, I think, and what every Man may very well expect from his Chriſtian Neighbour; they being not ſo much Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as Duties: And what every one, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands that Golden Rule, of <hi>Doing as they would be done by,</hi> will comply with without long entreaties. This is deſir'd by thoſe of the Reformation too, who require in their Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> that <hi>None judge of the Faith of their Churches, from Calumnies pick'd up here and there, or paſſages of Particular Authors, which are often falſly cited, or wreſted to a ſence contrary to their Intention: But from the Confeſſions of Faith of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Conel. Syn.</note> 
               <hi>their Churches, and from the Declarataion of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Doctrine unanimouſly made in that Synod.</hi> And this is a caution of ſo great importance, that where 'tis not obſerv'd, 'tis no wonder to ſee Men contending for the Truth of Chriſtianity, and to loſe it amidſt their Uncharitable Diſſentions.</p>
            <p>'Twas my intention not to increaſe, but to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh theſe heats, and for this end I put forth the double Character of a <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented and Repreſented.</hi> 'Twas this was the deſign of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> in his <hi>Expoſition of the Faith of the Catholick Church,</hi> and of the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> in the <hi>Acts of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly</hi> lately publiſh'd. The method is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive, and free from provoking Reflections; and if by this I have let the World know what our <hi>Church Believes</hi> and <hi>Teaches,</hi> 'tis what I intended: And as for Diſputing I leave that to ſuch, who think it worth their while.</p>
