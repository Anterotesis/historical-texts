            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DESCRIPTION OF the Life and Death of <hi>Iohn Lambe,</hi> otherwise called Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor LAMBE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His <hi>Lambe</hi> commonly called Doctor <hi>Lambe,</hi> whose Scandalous life hath beene a long subiect of discourse in this Kingdome, and whose tragicall and vnexpected death of late happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hath giuen cause of a sadde Example to all such wicked persons.</p>
            <p>To passe by his Childehood, and to come to the beginning of his life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after he was at mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, was for the most part spent in the houses of diuers Gentlemen, whose Children he taught to write and reade the English tongue. The first steppe that euer hee made towards that wicked course, which hee was afterwards accused for, was the profession of that noble and deepe Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Physicke, (a colour which many base Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postours haue vsed to lewde and iuggling practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as the best things are subiect to the greatest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses.)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20703:3"/>
Whether this Doctor <hi>Lambe,</hi> for so wee will now call him, had any abilitie of learning in him or no, I will relate the iudgements of some honest and able men, which haue talked with him. he seemed to them (how euer hee would talke highly to ignorant people) to be altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, and silly of discourse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else to affect that way of speaking as a colour of his mischeuous pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/> ctises<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rather to be thought by them an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postour, whom the credulous ignorance of the common people had raysed to that Fame, then to be truely and guiltily learned in those wicked My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steryes. But whether hee were truely the man, which the people conceiued him to bee, or not, I referre you to the proofes vpon Inditement at Assises against him and those other stories of him iustified by men and women of credit. He began within short time after he professed Physick in the Country, to fall to other mysteries, as telling of Fortunes, helping of diuerse to lost goods, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to young people the faces of their Husbans or Wiues, that should be, in a Christall glasse: reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to wiues the escapes and faults of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and to husbands of their wiues. By which meanes, whether truly or falsely told, he wrought so much vpon their credulitie, that many mischiefs and diuisions were wrought betweene marryed people. But his fame was neuer truely great, till he came to bee questioned by the Lawes of the Kingdome at Assises and Sessions. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of his lewdnesse in those ass<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mblies of Iustice, did raise an opinion of his abilitie among
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20703:3"/>
people, no lesse then some vnlearned and foolish Bookes in our time haue gotten credit among the people, onely because Authoritie hath censured them bad, which in steede of hurting the Authors, hath blowne them vp with a vaine pride, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured them in the iudgement of their ignorant admirers. The first tryall in a Court of Iustice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Doctor <hi>Lambe,</hi> of any note, was at the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes at Worcester, In which he was found guilty of two seuerall Inditements; one for vnchristian and damnable practises against the person of an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourble Peere of this Realme; and the other for damnable inuocation and worship of euill Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as will in the following discourse more at large ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
            <p>And because I would not trouble euery vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned person to finde out such as are learned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Indictements. Therefore for the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of all persons, I haue herein set downe the true effects of the said Indictments in English.</p>

            <p>Doctor <hi>Lambe</hi> being at a gentlemans house in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20703:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the County of <hi>Worcester</hi> playing of Iugling tricks, and diuers persons being with him: he fell into discourse with some of them, and left his christall ball vpon a table; a gentleman called Mr. <hi>Anthony Birch</hi> tooke vp the same, and the shape of a hand appeared in it; and looking still on the said ball, he see a shepheard with a sheepehooke and tarbox on his backe, whereat Master <hi>Birch</hi> being amazed did presently aske what that was he did see in the christall, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Lambe</hi> seeing him haue the same in his hand, snatched it away in great discontent, and put it vp in his pocket.</p>
            <p>This was proued by the same gentleman, by all which it manifestly appeareth that the said Doctor <hi>Lambe</hi> was an absolute Witch, a Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and Iugling person absolutely giuen ouer to lewd wicked and diabolicall courses, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocator and adorer of impious and wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>By his Art and skill in coniuration or rather by the information and instigation of his dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall spirits, he would vndertake any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing, and did very often discouer and bring to light goods and chattels although they had for a long time beene lost.</p>
            <p>Hee could also tell by the view of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son suspected for witchcraft, whether hee, or shee were a witch or not.</p>
            <p>Hee could tell the disease of any although hee neuer see the partie, and this was discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a Seruingman who comming amongst

diuers others to see Doctor <hi>Lambe,</hi> tould him, that his Maisters Daughter, did then lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of a certaine disease which hee then pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually related, and tould him her complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which gentlewoman hee did neuer see; neither was he asked any question concerning her disease.

            <p>There was amongst diuers other Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that resorted to Doctor <hi>Lambe</hi> whilest hee was a Prisoner, one Gentlewoman, that was very earnest with him to know who should bee her husband, and Doctor <hi>Lambe</hi> after hee had delayed her diuers times with promises to shew her what shee desired, appointed her a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie day to come to him, on which day shee accordingly came, and enquired of the keeper for him; and hee directed her to the chamber where hee lay, where when shee came, she called Doctor <hi>Lambe?</hi> who answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her, and bid her draw neere to his bed (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he was with his wearing apparell on) when shee was neere him, hee bid her looke in his Chrystall which hee laid on the ground; and asked her if shee did see any that shee did know: shee answered that shee did see diuers of her acquaintance there (there beeing then none in the Chamber but them two) who vanished away and the Chrystall beeing cleere from any further obiect shee turned her face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Doctor <hi>Lambe,</hi> and tould him that then there were no other sight shee could see in it:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20703:7"/>
wherevpon hee bid her pervse the Chrystall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and thereupon shee casting her eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the same, shee said to him, now I see a Gentleman all in greene, he bid her marke him well, for that same party within a short while would come to her Fathers house, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his comming thither should not bee with any intent to become a suiter vnto her, yet there so it would fall out that before his departure hee would haue cause to expresse himselfe, and that he in the end should bee her husband: shee therevpon answered that she did not know the Gentleman, nor did euer see any such man, before that apparition in the Chrystall; hee answered, that it was not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; it would come so to passe as hee had said. Wherevpon shee at that time departed reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably well satisfied; and comming home some of the Gentlewomen knowing of her beeing with Doctor <hi>Lambe</hi>) enquired the newes, and (as Gentlewomen are often inquisitiue and very earnest especially to know such rarieties) shee therevpon did make all knowne what had passed, and did describe to them what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell and of what stature and complexion the partie was that she had seene and was informed by Doctor <hi>Lambe</hi> should bee her husband: and not many dayes passed after this discouery but the Gentleman whom shee had so descry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, came to the Gentlewomans Fathers House, being a Counsellour at Law as a Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and hauing had his advise, and taking
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20703:7"/>
his horse at the doore, something did affright the horse as the Gentleman was getting vppe, which caused the horse to reare and kicke in that sort as the Gentleman was taken vp for dead, and there being no Inne neare that place he was conueyed into the Lawyers house, where hee continued vntill hee recouered his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer health, in which time hee fell in loue with the Gentlewoman: and shee with him, and in the end they were married together.</p>

But Doctor <hi>Lambe</hi> asked them what wine they would chuse to drinke; and when one of them answered Sacke, hee called for a Wine-glasse, and immediatly a pottle of Sacke

The Gentlemen afterwards parting from Doctor <hi>Lambe,</hi> and going to their lodgings in the Towne, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Tauerne-keeper whether any body had lately fetched a pottle of wine from thence, or no.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20703:10"/>
said, her husband was very ill and lay very hardly; but that was not that matter of her griefe as then, for it was a worse sorrow then that! O Lord said I, what more sorrowes then these you haue already, yet whatsoeuer they bee; desire God to giue you patience, for nothing can happen to you, but by Gods fore knowledge: but I pray sayd I, tell me what sorrowes these are that thus distract you, she still continued as before wringing her hands, and sayd, shee was not able to tell me, for shee was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, at last with my importance shee sayd <hi>Ioane</hi> was vndone, and shee sayd shee could tell me no more shee was not able, but prayed me to come home: so foorth-with I shut my doore and went with her, and by the way I demaunded the cause of her, shee told me it was that villaine Doctor <hi>Lambe</hi> had vndone her childe, and sayd shee could say no more her griefe was so great, but aske the girle said shee and she will tell you: so comming to the childe, I questioned with her, but shee being much abashed and ashamed, was long before shee would tell me: but at the last shee told me, that on Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sun-Euen, <hi>Lambes</hi> women being all very busie at her mothers house, there was no body to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie a basket of hearbes ouer to the Bench: but shee, who when shee came to Doctor <hi>Lamb,</hi> his man was in the chamber with him scraping of tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and Doctor <hi>Lamb</hi> tooke her hearbs of her and set her to play on the Virginals, and then hee sent out his man on a message and lockt the doore, and then tooke her and ledde her into his Closet and made fast that doore, and tooke her vppon a

Ioynt-stoole, and put his tongue in her mouth to kisse her, but shee was wonderous fearefull of him, and striued with him as much as she could, but hee would not let her alone, but stroue with her.</p>

                        <hi>Seager,</hi> I went ouer to Doctor <hi>Lamb</hi> to shew him what indeede hee knew before which was on the morrow after we knew of it: which when I came, I saw the chamber well fraught with women, and not past three men in all, and I saw the Doctor (not indeed knowing what he was) very busie foulding of linnen, shaking of them bettwixt him and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a white cloath pinde about him, and white sleeues vp to his elbowes, and as nimble as a Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners boy setting euery one in order. I demanded of his woman to speake with the Doctor, they told me, that was he in the white aperne: so at last hee went into his closet and called to me, and asked me if I would speake with him, I asked if his name were Doctor <hi>Lamb?</hi> That is it said he, marry said I, I am come to doe a message vnto you, that I am both sorry and ashamed to doe, sorrie said I in respect of the child, and sorrie for you, that you should offer to doe such a thing, for you haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done an honest mans child, for well shee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer her health of body againe, but neuer her credit, for it will bee a staine to her reputation whil'st shee liues: so many strumpets in the towne and to seeke the ruine of a poore child, I would to God said I you had not done it: With that he rail'd vppon my Lord of <hi>Winszor</hi> grieuously, with many base words, and said, hee did more good deedes in a weeke, then my Lord of <hi>Winszor</hi> did in a yeare: I grant you may doe so; but this one ill deede hath quite put out the light of all them good deedes, and still hee railed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on my Lord of <hi>Winszor:</hi> but I made answer, I did not know my

                     <p>And this is the truth, concerning this businesse with many appurtenances besides apertinant to the matter.</p>
                     <p>After his repriue vppon the rape, hee hired a house neere the Parliament house, where hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued about the space of a yeare and a quarter, in such a course of life, as differed not at all from his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer practices.

He in affright made toward the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as fast as he could out of the fields, and hired a

company of Sailors, who were there present to be his guard. But so great was the surie of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who pelted him with stones, and other things which came next to hand, that the Sailors (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did their endeauour for him) had much adoe to bring him in safetie as farre as <hi>Moore-gate.</hi> The rage of the people about that place increased so much, that the Sailors for their owne safetie, were forced to leaue the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him; and then the multitude pursued him through <hi>Coleman-street</hi> to the old <hi>Iurie,</hi> no house being able, nor daring to giue him protection, though hee had attempted many.
