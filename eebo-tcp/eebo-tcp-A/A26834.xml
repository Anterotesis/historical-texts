            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DECLARATION
OF
Sir WILLIAM BATTEN
late Vice-Admirall for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Concerning his Departure from
London, to His Highneſſe the Prince of Wales.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Suppoſe it is not unknown to the greater
part of this Kingdome, how for 7 yeares
I have ſerved the Parliament; with what
zeale and fidelity I obeyed their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
(while I was their <hi>Vice-Admirall,</hi>
and held their Commiſſion) God the
ſearcher of all hearts and themſelves can beſt teſtifie.
What benefit they received by my endevours becomes
not me to mention, and (to doe them right) themſelves
were ſtill prompt enough to ſend their voted Thanks for
my reducing the <hi>Fleet</hi> in the <hi>Downes,</hi> fetching in the
<hi>Swallow</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> for regaining <hi>Weymouth,</hi> for
ſecuring <hi>Lyme</hi> and <hi>Plymouth,</hi> for taking <hi>Hartford-weſt,
Portland, Pendennis,</hi> and <hi>Silly,</hi> for aſſiſting Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56477:3"/>
               <hi>Laughorne</hi> to rout the Forces in <hi>Pembroke-ſhire,</hi>
for relieving the <hi>L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Inchiquin</hi> when <hi>Youghall</hi> was beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
for repairing <hi>Deale</hi>-Caſtle with 600 <hi rend="sup">l</hi>. of my owne
money, for building a Fort at <hi>Plymouth</hi> with lime and
ſtone, which coſt me 500 <hi rend="sup">l</hi>. whereof I never received but
200 <hi rend="sup">l</hi>. and that (as the cuſtome was) not without a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Bribe; with many other ſervices, all which they
cannot be more willing to forget then now I would
have them.</p>
            <p>But why after all this (when their work was done and
without any cauſe ſhewed) I was diſplaced by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
at the Head-quarters at <hi>Putney</hi> with the advice of
their <hi>Adjutators,</hi> I could never underſtand; nor why I
was ſent for up by land, as not to be honoured to come in
with the Ship, threatned (by that falſe man Mr. <hi>Smith)</hi>
to have a Charge drawn up againſt me unleſſe I would
inſtantly lay down my Commiſſion, though nothing
was objected, but my ſuffering ſome of the 11 Members
to go beyond the Seas, when all of them had the <hi>Speakers
Paſſe;</hi> this, and becauſe I was not of the temper of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
were judged ſufficient to have me <hi>diſmiſſed,</hi> &amp; another
(ſuch another) thruſt in to be my Succeſſour as till then I
never imagin'd would be <hi>Vice-Admirall</hi> of a Navy.</p>
            <p>My Commiſſion thus ſurrendred, I was preſently
turn'd out of <hi>Deale</hi>-Caſtle, and could not obtain leave
for two nights longer, though my Wife was then ſick,
and forc'd from her Bed to lie at an Ale-houſe. But
how this wrought upon my Brethren the <hi>Sea-men,</hi> I
hope all my life I ſhall thankfully remember; they beſt
knew what ſervice I had done, and now beheld mine and
their own reward; whereof they expreſſed ſo juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
when all thoſe injuries offered to me were repayed
to my new Succeſſour, whom they refuſed to come on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56477:3"/>
Board, ſent him back to the Shoare, and bid him return-to
the place from whence he came; it being moſt reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
that that man ſhould hold no <hi>command</hi> who open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profeſſed himſelf to be a <hi>Leveller.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This new <hi>Vice-Admirall</hi> was no ſooner rejected, but
Letters came to me from ſeverall friends, that I would
return to the Ships; and the City of <hi>London</hi> (I heartily
thank them) petitioned the Parliament to reſtore me to
my place; ſo that ſome who had been moſt keen againſt
me, did now make freſh Overtures of a Commiſſion (if I
would embrace it) but I had reſolved no longer to ſerve
thoſe perſons, who (as HIS MAJESTY Himſelf told them)
<hi>Doe change their Principles with their Succeſſes;</hi> and (to
deale clearly with the world) I had engaged my ſelf to
His Highneſſe the Prince of WALES, to accept no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
but ſuch as His HIGHNESSE ſhould pleaſe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me, though this I preſume was then unknown, both
to <hi>Derby-houſe</hi> and the <hi>Head-quarters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now (according to their cuſtome) they began to make
me a <hi>Delinquent;</hi> and that moſt unworthy man, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Mildmay,</hi> accuſed me <hi>for aſsiſting the Earle of</hi> NOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WICH
at <hi>Stratford-bridge,</hi> and (as the L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>Say</hi> told me)
<hi>for ſending Horſes to Sir</hi> CHARLES LUCAS <hi>at Chelmeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
which whether true or falſe, was to them indifferent;
ſince now they reſolved to find me a <hi>Malignant,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they have given their uſuall Teſtimony by violent
breaking into my Houſe. Plundring my Goods, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtring
my Eſtate, with no ſmall incivilities to my
Wife and Family, whereat I nothing wonder ſince I hear
Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay's</hi> hand was to the Warrant.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould I complain when I ſee how they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
perſons of the greateſt eminency, that had done
them beſt ſervice, as the L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> WILLOUGHBY of <hi>Parham,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56477:4"/>
the L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> INCHIQUIN, Sir WILLIAM WALLER, Major
Generall LAUGHORNE, Maj. Gen: MASSEY, Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
BROWNE, Maj. Gen: POYNES, Colonel GRAVES,
Col. WEST, Col. BLAKE, Col. FORTESCUE, and many
others yet living, beſides thoſe already dead; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the City of LONDON, whoſe lives &amp; purſe were ſo
frankly expoſed, that above fourſcore times they had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<hi>Thanks for their great affection to the Parliament;</hi>
yet as a Reward for all their bloud and coine) an <hi>Army</hi>
was brought in upon them, the <hi>Tower,</hi> Forts, and Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines
ſeized, their <hi>Militia</hi> and Officers tane from them,
their Lord Major and Aldermen impriſon'd, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
marks of ſlavery from this ingratefull Faction, who
take no conſideration but of their advantage, the world
not having ſo ill Subjects, nor worſe Maſters.</p>
            <p>I had not ſaid this, if theſe injuries concerned only me
in particular; but ſuch injuſtice hath been exerciſed on
my profeſſion, as if the Sea-men were none of the
KING'S Subjects, and were to expect no benefit by the
<hi>Lawes of England:</hi> inſomuch, that lately when we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
our deſires for Peace, the Lord <hi>Say</hi> told us (in
too much ſcorn) <hi>he would have us know, the Parliament
ſhould not be Governed by a company of Saylors.</hi> To ſay
nothing of that malicious deſigne of bringing Land-Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
on board, to awe and enſlave the Sea-men, which
to all ſober men is the moſt ridiculous Tyranny ever yet
imagined; and which they I finde will not haſtily be
forgotten.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſſe, after the Vacating my <hi>Commiſsion;</hi>
I began more ſeriouſly to examine whom I had ſerved,
for till then, I was ſo diligent in performing their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
that I took ſmall leiſure to examine their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but when I remember we fought all this while
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56477:4"/>
               <hi>to fetch the</hi> KING <hi>to His Parliament,</hi> and yet now tis
made <hi>Treaſon</hi> to offer to bring Him thither; that ſome
<hi>Members</hi> were Voted Malignants <hi>for deſerting the Houſe,</hi>
and others made Delinquents <hi>for ſtaying in it,</hi> that we
took Oathes <hi>to defend the Kings Perſon and Authority;</hi>
and now muſt have a Government ſetled <hi>without Him,</hi>
and <hi>no Addreſſes made to Him,</hi> but Plots and Deſignes
to poyſon and deſtroy Him: Theſe and many other
ſuch horrible contradictions cauſe me to abandon theſe
enemies of Peace, and to make my humble addreſſes to
his Highneſſe the <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> whom (God is my
witneſſe) I come to ſerve faithfully as becomes an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
man &amp; a Loyall Subject; not drawn by hopes either
of honour or profit, as my friends &amp; acquaitance (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Capt. <hi>Jordan,</hi> a perſon of known integrity, &amp; great
skill in his profeſſion, who alſo comes along with me
upon the ſame reſolutions) can ſufficiently teſtifie. And
I humbly conceive (were nothing of Conſcience in it,
yet in common prudence) others are obliged to runne
the ſame courſe, it being impoſſible (conſidering His
Majeſties perſonall Vertues now evident to all the
world; the large poſſeſſion He hath in the hearts of His
people, of all His 3 Kingdomes, His numorous Progeny
and Allies) that ever Peace ſhould be obtained till our
KING <hi>be reſtored.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I would not be miſtaken, as if I were now turned
an enemy to Parliaments; for I profeſſe, I ſhall with the
hazard of my life and fortunes, endeavour the welfare
and being of free Parliaments; provided it be with the
juſt Rights of the KING <hi>and His Subjects,</hi> that by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
Treaty, or what other way it ſhall pleaſe God; the
good known Lawes of <hi>England</hi> may be revived, by a
firme and laſting Peace.</p>
