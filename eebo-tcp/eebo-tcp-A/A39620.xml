         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Summary of the whole Diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>S. 1. THe Text explain'd, and divided into three
parts, and thence three Doctrines rais'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> 2. <hi>The firſt Doctrine handled,</hi> That fearing God and
the King are inſeperable Duties: <hi>and there it is ſhew'd,</hi>
That though there be a connexion between all the Commands,
yet that there ſeems to be a cloſer Union between <hi>Fearing God
and the King;</hi> ſo that the <hi>One</hi> cannot be found without the
<hi>Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> 3. <hi>Second Doctrine,</hi> As a manifeſtation of our fearing
God and the King, we ought not to meddle with them who are
given to change: <hi>wherein is treated, §.</hi> 1. That we may
meddle with them who are given to change, either by conſenting
to them, or by aſſiſting them; and the medling either way
prov'd to be Unlawful. <hi>§.</hi> 2. <hi>By theſe Arguments,</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
contrary to the Duties of Subjection to Governours, and
praying for them. <hi>§.</hi> 3. 2<hi>dly,</hi> To the tenor of the Goſpel, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c. §,</hi> 4. 3<hi>dly,</hi>
The methods for bringing it about extreme ill; <hi>as,</hi> 1. by Lies.
2. by hypocritical pretences. 3. by violation of poſitive Oaths,
Natural Obligations, and entring into illegal Covenants. <hi>§.</hi> 5.
4<hi>ly.</hi> The means by which it's executed are baſe Treachery, or
open Violence. <hi>§.</hi> 6. 5<hi>ly,</hi> The Concomitants and Conſequences
of it are ſad and diſmal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> 4. <hi>The third Doctrine,</hi> That the endeavouring a
Change is very deſtructive to thoſe who engage in it: <hi>The
Danger of this remonſtrated in ſeveral reſpects:</hi> 1. There
is danger it may be diſcovered while it's carrying on, 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Deſign muſt be entruſted to many. 2. becauſe ſome
<pb facs="tcp:51740:4"/>
unforeſeen accident may adminiſter occaſion to the Diſcovery.
3. there is danger it may miſcarry at the point of execution.
4. it's in danger that it may not thrive through this World,
even after it hath ſucceeded, but that the Authors may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken,
and puniſh'd here. 5. however, they run a certain
danger of being mightily tormented in the other World.</p>
            <p>S. 5. §. 1. The firſt Uſe is of Reproof, directed againſt
thoſe who in their Practice diſſever the <hi>Fear of God</hi> and
<hi>the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 2. The ſeccond a Reprehenſion of thoſe who affect
a Change.</p>
            <p>§. 3. The third is Exhortatory, to perſuade not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
a Change, or meddle with them who do.</p>
            <p>§. 4. The fourth is Hortatory, to return Thanks and
Praiſe unto God, for his Goodneſs in preventing the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of thoſe who deſign'd to have work'd a Change here;
and to pray unto him that he would ſtill bring to nought
ſuch <hi>Counſels.</hi>

So in like manner, a man cannot be piouſly affected towards
God, without being honeſtly diſpoſed towards men; cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
his love towards the One, in the inſtances belonging to
him, without ſhewing it towards the Other in all points which
concern them; and he who pretends to the Former, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
the Latter,<note place="margin">1 St. John 3. 21, 22.</note> proclaims himſelf a Lyar.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this is plain and obvious, becauſe if I perform
the <hi>First</hi> from a right Principle, out of conſcience of my Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God requiring it: the ſame Principle will engage me to
do the <hi>Second,</hi> becauſe he demands that likewiſe. And on the
other ſide, if the motive of my Love and Reſpect to my fellow-Creature
Man, be his bearing the Image of God, I cannot but
love and reverence Him who faſhion'd him after his own likeneſs.</p>
            <p>And as there is no dividing, ſo there is no commuting of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
Our Zeal in <hi>one kind,</hi> will not make attonement for our

there is a cloſer and more indiſſoluble Union (if I may be permit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
to ſay ſo) between theſe two particular ones of <hi>fearing God,
and the King,</hi> by how much Kings are more lively expreſſions of
God's Majeſty and Power, than ordinary Images, other men, are.

King is the ſame Act as Fearing of Him, or expreſſive of it.</p>
            <p>And Kings, for their nearer and exacter reſemblance of Him,
are adorn'd with His Title, wear His Name, and have His Stile

Him, an Apoſtacy from God; a reſiſting Him, an oppoſing God;
rebelling againſt Him, fighting with God; the ſetting up the
Title of a counterfeit Prince againſt the true One, an introducing
a Plurality of God-heads; the obeying of a Uſurper, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;
the ſlandering his Anointed and his Foot-ſteps, a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming

ſo we cannot <hi>Honour</hi> this Laſt as we ſhould, without
<hi>Fearing</hi> the Former as we ought. We cannot revere the Copy
of Divinity tranſcribed in the King, without revering the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
the Deity, from whom his Power came, any more than we
can have a veneration for the Picture of a man, and none for his
Perſon; We cannot be for the Monarchy, and ſupporting it,
while we dethrone God, by a denying him either in Words or
Actions; not for upholding the Government, while by impious
Diſputes, or wicked Lives, we exclude his Regiment out of the
World; not for maintaining the Prerogative, while we are for
clipping the Wings of his Power, and confining it to ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

            <p>There is no bearing true Faith and Allegiance to our King,
when we do it not to our God; no being Loyal Subjects to the
One, while we are down-right Traytors to the Other.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this is clear, becauſe the honouring and obeying

theſe; which if they do not, they are falſe and ſpurious, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the true and genuine Parent, a right Principle I mean, for
their production, and muſt needs be fickle and inconſtant, for not
being grounded upon a ſure and ſtanding bottom: So that
when in inviting occaſion offers of promoting our Intereſt to
greater advantage, of ſerving our ambition with better ſucceſs,

For is not the Aſſaſſination of God's Anointed, thus contrary

he certainly debaſed Religion, in ſetting up the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and
<hi>Bethel,</hi> and proclaiming they were the Gods which brought the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> ſo it's as little to be queſtion'd but that

and Garriſons it was neceſſary he ſhould maintain for the

have been under <hi>Solomon,</hi> while the Kingdom ſtood entire, and
his Reign flow'd with Peace and Wealth.</p>
            <p>The third method is,<note place="margin">The third Method toward a Change, <hi>Breaking Oaths.</hi>
               </note> Breaking through all Oaths they ſtand

they call'd God's Omniſcience to witneſs theſe Engagements, and

            <p>And yet, as if they were no more to be held by them than <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>

who were ſecluded (1648.) by violence, for voting the King's
Conceſſions ſatisfactory, and a ground for Peace; who diſſolving
themſelves, made room for the ſitting down of that Aſſembly
which recals home our Exil'd King and His Brothers.</p>
            <p>And when all the Tribes ſeem'd unanimous in bringing back
our <hi>David</hi> to his Throne, and he was according to their wiſh ſafe
ſeated thereon, one would have thought all theſe Feaveriſh Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
ſhould have been allay'd, our floating Iſland fix'd by His
Reſtauration, as they ſay <hi>Delos</hi> was by <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Birth. But there
was no ſuch matter; for there was a Party of men injur'd, as
they ſuppos'd, by His Reſtitution, becauſe it ſtript them of their
ill-got Wealth and Power: and theſe were reſtleſs to bring all

            <p>Theſe endeavoured to ſeize His Majeſties Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>I will not trouble you with repeating to you the method of this
laſt Project, which you have had fully and yet ſuccinctly deduced
in His Majeſties Declaration; but it may be I ſhall trouble you,
and grate your tender ears, in charging you with aſſiſting towards
it, and ſo bringing you in as <hi>Medlers with them who were given to
change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, Did not you ſhew your ſelves ſuch, by ſiding and going
along with that Faction which wrought the laſt diſmal Change, or
by following men who trac'd their ſteps, and practis'd the ſame
methods of Sedition which uſher'd in that Rebellion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51740:18"/>
For firſt, Did you not greedily ſwallow down the Lies they fed
you with againſt the Government; ſometimes as if it was making
it ſelf Arbitrary and Tyrannical; other times as if it was ſelling
you for Bondſlaves to the <hi>French;</hi> and by and by as if it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
Popery, Images were juſt a ſetting up in your Churches
to be worſhip'd, and the holy Water for ſprinkling was already
in the Porches?</p>
            <p>And when the falſhood of theſe were diſcover'd to you, were
you not as ready to entertain any new ones they devis'd to ſtop
thoſe Leaks, (though never ſo ridiculous?) Had they not inured
you ſo to them, or you your ſelves, that your Spirits were not to
be kept up without them; as men accuſtoming their Stomachs to
Brandy, are fainting if they warm them not ever and anon with a
Dram of the Bottle.</p>
            <p>2. Have you not had their perſons in the greateſt admiration,
who made the biggeſt noiſe for <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> while their
Lives manifeſted they had extinguiſh'd the <hi>One</hi> all but the Name,
and their arbitrary proceedings that they were reſolv'd to proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
the <hi>Other</hi> to their own Luſts? Such who had ſcrupl'd at Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Decency in the Church, but had made none of involving
three Kingdoms in miſery and Confuſion; ſtrain'd at Conformity,
but ſwallow'd down Rebellion; ſtumbl'd at a Ceremony, but
leap'd over the Murther of their King?</p>
            <p>Were not ſuch eſteem'd the fitteſt perſons you could chooſe to
repreſent you, and act on your behalf; <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> to Reform Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
for you; <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> to ſecure your Property; <hi>Old Army-Officers,</hi>
to guard your Liberty; and <hi>Conſpirators of forty years
growth and upwards,</hi> to ſhield you from the danger of the late Plot?</p>
            <p>3. Laſt of all, Did you not look upon your ſelves as abſolved
from the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and on them as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated
Bonds? Or were you not for expounding them ſo as they
might be beſt accomodated to Rebellion, or willing Diſciples of
ſuch Maſters who did? That they were ſtipulations of a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Obedience, provided the King maintain'd your Rights, and
that limited and reſtrained to ſome Caſes only; ſo that the King
not performing the former, you were not bound to the latter; or

commanding ſomething without the Verge of his Authority,
might be oppos'd by Arms, and forc'd within compaſs; or that

Did not the Caſuiſtical Divinity of ſuch Rabbies pleaſe you, who

Head in time, as well as to enfeeble his hands for the preſent?

he remembred to bring to open Light and condign Puniſhment men who
thirſted after it: Let us, for this eminent mercy, be praiſing him, and with
the memorial of our deliverance, tranſmit our Thanks to Poſterity; for the

would change the hearts of ſuch evil-minded perſons, whoſe diſ-affection
to the Government makes them afflicted and griev'd for its Proſperity; and
put them in fear, ſuch as they may not dare for the future to think of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing
