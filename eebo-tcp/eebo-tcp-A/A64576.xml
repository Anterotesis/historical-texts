            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>COncerning the rise of the present business between my self and <hi>Thomas Speed,</hi> be pleased to receive this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; About two years ago or more, I did (upon importunity) give way to Mr. <hi>Speeds</hi> Preaching in my charge; I confess it was not without reluctancy, because he had been so long a publick Teacher, and yet no Minister; that is, not called to that office in the way of Christ; yet I knew not but that he might (in a further time) be so called, he being in such a tendency to that Office: but while there were hopes of him that he might do some good service in the Church of Christ, there comes newes that he had joyned himself to those whom they call <hi>Quakers.</hi> The report at first was very strange, but when it was found to be so indeed, it troubled me much that I should be induced to admit one to Preach in my place, so poorly principled, and of so inconstant a spirit, as to close with such a company, and be wafted over suddenly to so sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a Sect.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, after many debates with my self, I resolved to write unto him about the Quakers way; for I had not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son then to think him to be a Scorner, but rather hoped that some good might have been done upon him, and that he was not so far gone and hampered in Satans snare, but that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly he might, by a milde admonition, be recovered out of it; at least, I did not know but that there might be so much inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity left, as to return unto a calm and friendly Letter, a fair and civill Answer. But how far he was from any such humane frame, his rough and <hi>Quaker-like</hi> Reply to my first Letter, did more then sufficiently manifest. Yet because in
<pb facs="tcp:64656:3"/>
that his first return (amongst a great deal of rudeness) there was something that looked like reason. I wrote my second Letter in way of Answer to his first; but that high spirit of his that could not receive an admonition in my first Letter, could not bear an answer in my second, but must needs tumultuate in Print; and by this means our Contestation is come into publick view. In which regard it might have been satisfactory to have published the Letters that passed between us; but being that they were so large as that it would be tedious to print and peruse them; and his <hi>Reply</hi> (together with this <hi>Rejoynder</hi>) will present (in good part) the substance of them, therefore I have resolved to publish no more but only my first brief Letter; whereby it will appear (I think) how little cause this angry Antagonist had to fall into so hot a combate. For this was the Letter:
<floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>Mr. <hi>Speed,</hi>
                        </salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>THough my acquaintance with you hath not been much, yet since (by providence) there hath been some, and that also a Pulpit-acquaintance, by your Preaching not long since in my place and charge; I presume you will not take it ill if I shall a little more then ordinarily impart my self unto you upon the report that I have heard from divers (who know you, and are like to know your way) of your closing (though how far I know not) with those that own the name of <hi>Quakers</hi>: I have read but one of their Books, viz. <hi>The fierie Darts of the Devill quenched</hi>; but therein I find enough to make it strange that any that hath known and owned, much more that hath held forth Gods Scripture way, should have any correspondence with them in theirs.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> though they do not <hi>professedly</hi> reject them; yet <hi>really</hi> they do, whilest they hold and witness;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That they are not the rule of Saints, contrary to these Scriptures, Gal. 6.16. Jam. 2.8. Deut. 5.32, 33. 2 Pet. 1.19.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they are not the ground of faith, contrary to Joh. 20.31. Rom. 16.26 <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi> Rom. 10.17. So that the word of God was
<pb facs="tcp:64656:3"/>
ever the ground of Faith, even before it was written as now it is (for though it were not written, yet it was revealed) And now it is written, Christ directs us to look for life in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, because they <hi>testifie of him,</hi> to wit, as the person on whom our faith should rest for salvation, Joh. 5.39, -46, 47.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</hi> They acknowledge a command of Christ for it, to stand for a time and no more; when Christ tels us his death is to be shewed therein <hi>till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the <hi>Ministery.</hi> As they deny there was any true Church since the Apostles dayes, (which is as though they should say, Christ hath had no body upon earth since the Apostles dayes, for <hi>the Church is his body</hi>) So they deny any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, unlesse called as the Apostles were; when we finde <hi>Titus</hi> ordaining Elders in an ordinary way, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.5. and that Christ (the Apostles and extraordinary officers being gone) hath appointed Pastors and Teachers for the work of the Ministery, and the edifying of Saints to the end of the world, Mat. 28.19, 20. Ephes. 4.11, 12, 13.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They assert, That the light within leads to Justification those that are taught by it; when the Scripture saith, that <hi>We are justified freely by the grace of God,</hi> through the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and righteousness of Jesus Christ, which is not within us, but without us.</p>
                     <p>Now all these things (that I may speak of no more) being so contrary to the will of God revealed in his Word, let me seriously advise you (and while I say so, I think of that great God to whom shortly we must be accountable, and with whom there is no trifling) I say, let me seriously advise you, to take heed of the society and wayes of such men. Remember and read what a strict rule the Apostle gives us concerning them that bring not right Doctrine, 2 Joh. 10, 11. God hath given you ability to do good, take heed, I beseech you, of losing your self, or endangering others in a way of errour; Who knowes, if a man shall give way to opinions so dangerous as these are, how far he may go; yea, how far God in his just judgement may suffer him to run on in a soul-destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way? My intent in these lines is to tender a Christian ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
<pb facs="tcp:64656:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for your spiritual safety. As it is only between you and me, so I desire you to keep it to your self, to prevent further trouble and contestation. The Lord follow it with his blessing. I rest,</p>
                     <closer>
                        <signed>Yours in Christ, <hi>W. T.</hi>

               </floatingText>
            </p>
            <p>Now considering what and how this un-malleable man hath written since. It may (perhaps) seem strange to some (or to many) that I should bestow so much time and pains upon an Adversary whose ability and reputation reacheth not so far (as one would think) as to win upon Christians who have any skill in Religion, or bear good will to the wayes of God. And I confesse that such apprehensions have often given a check to my proceedings. But yet (on the other side) being cald to <hi>by name,</hi> to speak in this cause and controversie, I have been carried on so far as (after the publishing of my late Answer to his <hi>Epistle)</hi> to Rejoyn also to the body of his Book; and that for these Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because it is the duty and safety of Gods people to cry for, and against the abominations of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Hereupon I have been more large in opening some Scriptures, as intending not only to Answer this <hi>Replyer,</hi> (which might be much more briefly done) but to inform less expert Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who for want of a right understanding of Gods word, are exposed to the wiles and wils of seducing men. For the same reason also I use more words and circumlocutions then are needful for, or grateful to, men of more understanding, as knowing my self to be a debtor to those that have lesse.</p>
            <p>After all this, I can truly and sincerely say (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any sharper expressions wrested from me) that it would be a singular comfort to me, if this sometimes hopeful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (with whom I have had so much to do) might be brought yet back again <note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 28.37.</note>; And what cannot that God <hi>do,</hi> and what cannot that God <hi>undo,</hi> that puld <hi>Paul</hi> out of the hands of Satan, who was so long educated, and so deeply principled in a damnable belief, that <hi>he ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jesus of Nazareth</hi>

            <p>However, according to my time and talent, I have done mine endevour, which (God assisting) shall be followed with the earnest prayer of him who much needs, and much desires the prayers of the generation of Seekers; and in whose heart it is to approve himself</p>

Saints, and the ground of Faith (and that I said more, he shall not prove) that I say still; and its neither untrue (as I hope this rejoinder will shew) nor scandalous; or if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it any way scandalous in regard of himself, himself hath made it so.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I very much doubt whether he speak really and as the trurh is, when he declareth that to be the principal cause of putting his Reply to the Press; what need so large a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for so narrow a sore, and a printed Book for a few pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate words? But let his Epistle to the publike Teachers of this Nation speak whether the great end of putting out his Book, were not (I do not say to be revenged upon my self, an inferior Minister, for a feigned wrong; but) to shoot his Arrows, even bitter words against those whom he calls (with a bad conscience) the Chief Priests, that is, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Nation, as a bloody crew and company of men, such as they were that crucified the Lord Jesus.</p>

Now he that will thus mis-represent what is before his eyes, deserves a Reproof rather then an Answer, and therefore if I say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to divers such things, I presume I shall be excused.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We do not expect that men should stoop to the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table directions of the Pulpit; but require them to submit to the immutable counsel of God, which we deliver as <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> did, out of a Pulpit, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.4.</p>

I did not say he did assert them; but my self had reason to speak of those things, to shew the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their quaking and that mentioned in Scripture, by which they would protect themselves; therefore I said, that they in Scripture received no denomination, or were not named from it, as these men are; for I know not from what else they own the name of <hi>Quakers.</hi> I said also, that they made no trade of it, as these men do, divers of whom have left their Trades and Callings and betaken themselves to a Trading in the quakers Employment.</p>
               <p>Now that there is no sufficient protection for their <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> from the trembling of holy men in Scripture, I shall expresse (in general) in the words of a Church and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of godly Christians, better acquainted with them then my self. <note n="a" place="margin">In a Letter from the Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and some brethren of the Church of Christ, meeting at <hi>Stopport,</hi> in the name of the rest, <hi>Sam.

               <p>
                  <hi>W.T.</hi> A. It's true, that what Christ spake was infallible; but this he saith to no purpose; for Christ doth not speak there as one that would presse them to receive what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers upon his bare word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as one that would convince them of the truth of what he spake by Scripture; that is, by his necessary and unanswerable reasonings from it: He doth not say, <hi>Ye do erre,</hi> not knowing me to be an infallible Teacher, whom you ought to believe upon his word; but, <hi>not knowing the Scriptures and the Power of God</hi>; both which plainly prove that there shall be, and may be a resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>T.S. <hi>Were you as infallible in those meanings and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which you force upon the Scriptures, as he was in what he spake from the Spirit of the Lord, I should readily close with them as the Oracles of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>W.T. A 1. If all Pastors and Teachers were Apostles, then these men would presently be Converts: This is like them that said to our Savior, <hi>Let him now come down from the Cross, and we will believe him</hi>: but they who contemn that means which God in his wisdom ordains, and will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without that means which they in their folly demand, justly perish.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither is this device of any value; for the question is not whether we be infallible in our meanings and deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but whether that which is deduced and drawn from Scripture, that is, necessarily, and upon supposal that we are not deceived in the deducing, be Scripture, or a thing tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained in Scripture, which I affirm it is. Let him not talk to no purpose, but keep him to his work, and prove the contrary.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W.T.</hi> A. We willingly acknowledge we are fallible or men that may be deceived &amp; therefore do not onely give liberty, but give counsel to people, and exhort them to examine what we say, and to see whether God in his Word do not say it also; and according as it agreeth or disagreeth with that Word, so to receive it, or lay it aside. But withal, two things may be considered: 1. That it is no untruth, nor immodesty to say, That the Ministers of this Nation be as infallible as other Teachers are; so that the matter will be brought to this issue, Either there must be no Teaching, and thats against Scripture, which declareth Teaching to be a perpetual Ordinance, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19, 20. and (as it were) the Churches Inheritance, <note n="d" place="margin">As <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21. or else there mast be found in these dayes infallible Teachers, and that's against experience; (none pretending to infallibility but the Pope, or they that are like him) or else we must be taught, (and that's the truth) by men that are fallible. But, secondly; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, we affirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that what we collect by sound natural and necessary inference from Scripture, that's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, though we be not. Is it not an infallible truth that there be three Heavens, though we do not read in Scripture (that I remember) of a first and second Heaven [I mean in expresse words?] if there be a third Heaven (which the Scripture expresly assureth us of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2.) then there must needs be two more, though the Scripture name them not</p>

               <p>W.<hi>T.</hi> Answ. Here he puts down a word or two of what I spake, leaving out the rest, and then makes as if I had spoken that which I never spake; for I never said, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the word [<hi>Rule</hi>] was there, therefore the Scripture is the Saints Rule; but the force of the Argument lies in this, That the very word [<hi>Rule</hi>] is expressed there for the end and purpose, to declare &amp; hold forth the Scripture to be a Rule: For here's an happy end, <hi>Peace and Mercy</hi>; &amp; a <hi>walk</hi> prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for the attaining of that end, &amp; a <hi>Rule</hi> revealed to guide that <hi>walk,</hi> to wit, that Word of God which is written in the two verses immediately going before, <hi>viz. v.</hi> 14, 15. wherein all men are directed to <hi>glory in the Cross of Christ,</hi> v. 14. and that so as to <hi>become new Creatures,</hi> v. 14, 15. that is, they are guided to faith, accompanied with holinesse, as the sure way to happinesse.</p>
               <p>For the further opening and confirming whereof, let it be observ'd, that the Apostle doth, in the close of this Epistle, knit up the Doctrine of the whole Epistle, yea of the whole Gospel, yea of the whole Bible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (whereupon this is justly extended by Divines to the whole Canonical Scripture) and the Doctrine is this, That we are to look for Justification and life not in the works of the Law (either without Christ, or with Christ) but in Christ crucified alone; apprehended by Faith; and yet that faith is not <hi>alone,</hi> but appears in the novation of our nature within; and in working by love
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64656:11"/>
without, in the keeping of all Gods Commandments.</p>
               <p>This is apparent by v. 14. where <hi>Paul</hi> professeth his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in the Crosse of Christ alone; that is, his contentful and triumphant confidence in Christ crucified; the rather for the blessed effect thereof, which he found in himself; to wit, <hi>The worlds being crucified to him, as he was to the world</hi>; that is, whereby he was made a new creature; which is a thing so considerable, that (if we reckon of things as Christ doth) all outward priviledges and preheminences are nothing, v. 15.</p>
               <p>Hereupon it follows, v. 16. <hi>As many as walk according to this Rule</hi>; that is, this Scripture-Doctrine, which teacheth men by faith to rest on, and rejoyce in Jesus Christ <hi>crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>crucifying</hi>; that is, so working on, and in them by their believing in him, as that they are crucified with him, and become new creatures; <hi>Peace shall be upon them, Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>and mercy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. whether they be Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; when otherwise nothing will avail either the one or the other for peace and life.</p>
               <p>Now, if any shall say as this Writer doth, (who gives forth a meaning himself, when he cries out upon other men for doing the like) that the <hi>Rule</hi> is <hi>the new Creature</hi>; (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby the Law and Direction of the Spirit in the heart of a person regenerated) this falls in with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for the Spirit suggesteth no other Rule to the heart, then that which it expresseth in the Word.</p>
               <p>But the Apostle sufficiently decides this matter, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets himself, <hi>Ch.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. where handling the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>viz. Resting on Christ by faith, for righteousness and life</hi>; and bringing in the very same reason that he doth here, he doth a little vary the words, and instead of the <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (named here) puts <hi>Faith working by love.</hi> So that the Rule is plainly this, To look for salvation by Faith in Christ Jesus working by love; which is the character of a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who first is in Christ by Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. and then, that Faith worketh by love and in holinesse, because the new creature is Gods workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10.</p>

                  <hi>W.T.</hi> He's a great Undertaker, that assumes so much to himself, as to discover a mans intentions. But to the thing I answer; The whole Scripture is the compleat Rule; and the several parts of Scripture are the Rule in part: Whereupon I adde further, That he that rejects all Scripture, rejects the whole Rule; but he that rejects but a part, is truly said to reject Scripture; for every part of Scripture is Scripture. The <hi>quakers</hi> therefore denying the Scripture to be the Saints Rule, really reject the Scripture; that is, they reject those Scriptures from which it is necessarily concluded that it is their Rule. Now for his Argument its true; That they who reject any Scripture (as <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>W.T.</hi> I did, and do answer him, That with respect to our Labour in Preaching, we receive a maintenance from these Scripture Rules; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. <hi>So hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.

It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture-Rule that Ministers should be maintained, suppose that no particular way of maintenance be prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, yet that Rule doth evince the Righteousnesse of any lawful way, such as that by Tythes is. Till he prove that an unlawful way of maintenance, we still plead the Scripture-Rule, which requires a maintenance.</p>

                  <hi>then dayes of fasting and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation must be kept, pretending to seek God, to know who hath the clearest Call; and though you are all resolved in your hearts beforehand to get it if you can, yet the Name of God, and the Prayers of some well-meaning people must be made use of by every one of you as a cloak, lest your deceit should be too plainly discovered. I know you will call this clamour; but I speak plain truth.</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. There may be just reason for the exchanging of a mans place by the judgement of the Church of God, out of respect to the benefit of the Church, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Jesus Christ. And a man may be duly called from a place where there is lesse maintenance to another where there is more, to wit, because there is more work there (which rebukes the affecting of the maintenance.) Now, if any change ungroundedly, or passe into any place disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly (whereof here's no proof) for that I shall not plead.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is not very like that they who betake themselves to fasting and humiliation, are the persons that are guilty of such mis-removeals; self-seeking and God seeking do not well agree together: nor is it like that Gods people will come together to fast and pray upon a worldlings call; sure they take him to be a godly Minister with whom they join in such an exercise; and if he prove otherwise, so publike a course will make his sin the more observed, and so will turn to his greater shame. If he be wise therefore, though he be not good, it is not probable that he will walk in that way; mean while this helps to cast a profane contempt upon Gods highest course in difficult cases, and teacheth Atheistical people what to say when they see a Minister humbling his soul (together with Gods people) to seek resolution from him. Fasting and prayer they will acknowledge to be good in it self; but when any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister (sought to for a removeal) comes to practise this course, they cry out against it, for this man tels them (and they be glad to hear it) that there is nothing but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie in it. So all fasts for Ministers direction (in case of their call from one place to another) become a matter of derision.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This [Poetical] Relator saith it is thus: But how shall we know that he speaks truth? Is it certainly true that Ministers that seek to God to clear up their call, are [resolved] and [all] resolved, and all resolved [in their hearts] before hand, <hi>to get a rich Parsonage if they can</hi>? How doth this man know the resolution of all Ministers hearts?

I do not think he knows the mens names that do so, (nor can name any one man upon whom to lay that imputation justly, which he layes flatly upon all) but yet he knows their hearts; will any man think (that hath any thing of charity, or Christianity in him) that [all] the Ministers in this Nation that fast and pray in this case, are thus resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?

               <p>W.<hi>T.</hi> Surely if great words would carry a Cause, this man would never fail to conquer. But to come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I answer, That though the Apostle doth not intend in those words to prove Infant-Baptism; yet he intends what he saies, and what I cited the words for, to wit, That we must render to every one that which is due; and more then that I desire not, nor intend to take from that Scripture; for, that Baptism is an Infants due, I prove otherwise; and if it be so, then by that general Rule (both of Scripture and Nature) it ought to be rendred to him. And I did the rather bring this place of Scripture, because the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against Infant Baptism is, That there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it; whereas (if Baptism be an Infants due) there lies in this Scripture, though not a particular, yet a pressing command for it in the general Law of rendring what is due
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64656:17"/>
If any shall say (for I am not onely willing to answer him (which is soon done) but to satisfie others) I say therefore, that if any shall say and object, That the Apostle applies this general Precept onely to things civil, and therefore it is improperly drawn to Baptism, which is a religious Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I answer, That the <hi>application</hi> of a general precept or <hi>axiome</hi> is one thing, the <hi>restricti</hi> is another.

               <p>Now its true, that baptizing Infants as it is <hi>a duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> belongs to the first Table; but as it is <hi>a duty of rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now to winde up all; since the Apostle applies the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of rendring what is due to all men generally, and that also in all the duties of the second Table; and since to the first commandment of the second Table, every due from Parents to children is to be referred; it is therefore mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that if baptizing Infants be a due, then Parents are not only permitted, but commanded (and that not onely by vertue of that general sentence in it self, but also by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles application of it) to render it to them.</p>

Its the most compendious way to brand that with folly which a man cannot answer with reason.

               <p>Which I prove thus,</p>
               <p>If the Infant of a believing Parent be as soon as it is born, a holy child, and hath a right to the Covenant, then the initiating seal of the Covenant is due to him also.</p>
               <p>This sequel I prove because he that is an holy child (to wit by federal holiness) ought to be declared so to be, by putting that mark upon him, by which Gods holy people are outwardly distinguished from Heathens. And he that hath a right to the Covenant, should be possessed of his right, that is, be taken in Gods way into the number of Gods Covenant-people.</p>
               <p>

               <p>W. T. A. Its true that the word [Sacrament] among profane Authors signifies a military oath, which because it was accounted of all things the most sacred, yea, and went under the name also of a most holy mystery <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly I answer, That how far soever Popery had prevailed to corrupt this Nation, yet through the mercy of God, there hath been many years since a Reformation,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64656:31"/>
Antichrist and Popery have been ejected; Ordination as well as other things, purged and ever since exercised in the way of Christ, for it was managed by Ministers (upon precedent tryall) in the face of the Congregation, and that with notice given to the people present,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that if they knew any impediment or notable crime in any presented to Ordination, they should discover it; which if they did, the ordering of that person was to be staied till he cleared himself: There was also adjoined an earnest admonition to those that were admitted into holy Orders to do their office faithfully: I do not say (notwithstanding all this) that there was nothing defective in the ordination, but nothing destructive to it, nor giving any just reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it, or question the validity of it.</p>
               <p>These things will be considerable, and I doubt not, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with those that are willing to be satisfied as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ministeriall Calling. But for the establishing of weak Christians that are not able to search into matters more removed from their capacity, they may comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly content themselves and preserve in their hearts and consciences, the reverence of our Ministry, by the Apostles popular and powerfull argument drawn from the success of it upon their own souls, <hi>Who are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministred by us, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in the fleshy tables of the heart,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.3.

               <p>Yet Ministers that impose hands are far from assuming to themselves the giving of grace (which belongs to God onely) nor do they make it an operative ceremony, but whilest they use that Rite and declarative Sign, which the Scripture holds forth in the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>W.T.</hi> You finde the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> calling to King <hi>Ahab</hi> for a tryal, that brought many false Prophets to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.19.40.</p>
               <p>T.S. <hi>How do you prove the Prophets of</hi> Baal <hi>to be Hereticks any more, than the poor Indians in</hi> America, <hi>that worship the Creatures</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W.T.</hi> I did not say, the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> were Hereticks (nor was it needfull, for his question was extended to the punishing of men for conscience sake) but yet why may not such be called <note n="a" place="margin">Haereticum hominem tria faciunt; Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, convictio, contumacia.</note> Hereticks, who were habitual and most obstinate opposers of the truth; yea, of the nature of God in their most abominable Idolatry.

               <p>T.S. <hi>Doth the Scripture say, that</hi> Elijah <hi>call'd to</hi> Ahab <hi>to punish</hi> Baals <hi>Prophets,</hi>

                  <hi>who was himself a worshipper of</hi> Baal? <hi>or doth it onely say, that he bad him send and gather them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and do you read that</hi> Ahab <hi>did more than</hi> Elijah <hi>desired of him</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:64656:34"/>
                  <hi>W.T. A.</hi> The afore-cited Scripture shews, that <hi>Elijah</hi> called to <hi>Ahab</hi> when the Kingdome was pestered and pined with Idolatry; and why made he his address to him, but to have the assistance of his kingly power, for a course and concertation tending to (and ending in) the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets execution, which he, being a Prophet, did (in all likelihood) fore-see should come to such an issue; yea, this Objector saith after. <hi>It cannot be imagined but that if</hi> Elijahs <hi>God had not been known to be the God that answered by fire, the portion of</hi> Baals <hi>Prophets had fallen to</hi> Elijahs <hi>Lot</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore on the other side, it may be reasonably said, that if God did answer <hi>Elijah</hi> by fire, then <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets should undoubtedly have the portion which in conclusion befell them, else the business had been unjustly carried, and would have become an useless tryall. Should Ministers make such address to Authority as <hi>Elijah</hi> did, what out-cries should we hear, when there be so many cryes against us, though we be in many respects on the suffering side? Nor doth it follow that because <hi>Ahab</hi> himself was a worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of <hi>Baal,</hi> therefore he would not give way to <hi>Elijahs</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; for all the people gave way to it, among whom were divers wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Unto this another reason may be added; to wit, the miserable condition they were in by the present famine, which came by <hi>Elijahs</hi> word, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.1. and was most like to be removed in <hi>Elijahs</hi> way; for there must not be <hi>dew or rain,</hi> but <hi>according to his word,</hi> and on that it came, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18 41. <hi>Jam.</hi> 52.8 even the worst of Kings in publick calamities were willing to take Prophets counsel &amp; to obtain some comfort from them, though they were sharpely reproved by them (as here <hi>Ahab</hi> was) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had it; see 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3 13. No marvel therefore,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64656:35"/>
if <hi>Ahab</hi> in his necessity closed with <hi>Elijah</hi> that was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable a person, so hopefull a Prophet, and one so like to contrive a deliverance in Gods way.</p>
               <p>T.S. <hi>Besides that, the prophets of</hi> Baal <hi>were not executed by any Order or command of</hi> Ahab,<note place="margin">p. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>but it was the fruit of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact made between</hi> Elijah <hi>and the prophets of</hi> Baal, <hi>with the consent of the people,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W.T. A.</hi> suppose it were the event of that compact, whereof he speaks; Yet, 1. was it not <hi>Ahab</hi> that sent to all Israel to convene them for such a purpose? And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact (for the main) was with, and was concluded with the people of Israel before the prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.24. which is to be marked, that we may know whence the destruction of those idolatrous prophets arose, to wit, from the peoples agreement summoned by the King upon <hi>Elijahs</hi> motion and design. 2. Was not <hi>Ahab</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at the compact? Was not his consent in it? Yea, was not he present at the slaughter? <hi>verse</hi> 40, 41. At least durst the people have done that execution, but that they knew the King was engaged to a consent by the compact made in his presence, and made good by his sending for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> that it might be acted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to agreement?</p>
               <p>Now where as he saith, that <hi>if God had not answered by fire, the portion of</hi> Baals <hi>prophets had fallen on</hi> Elijah, that is like enough; but that doth not prove that <hi>Ahab</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that the prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> should be slain, when the Lord did answer by fire; nay, its far more probable, (as we may partly collect from the peoples killing of them who yet themselves were worshippers of <note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Baal</hi>) I say, it is far more probable that he (as well as the people) was so convinced with Gods determination from heaven (unto which we may adde the hope of plenty usually succeeding reformation) that he willingly gave way to it: And we finde he stood upon good terms with <hi>Elijah</hi> that ran before him when it was done.</p>

Little did we think of the strange things that have arisen since; For that God that ordereth all things according to the counsell of his own will, left the consultations of supreme powers unto such differences and distastes, that they fell into a sad War, followed with the effusion of much Christian bloud, which any man that hath the heart of a Christian was so far from taking pleasure in, as to make it (when things were come to that passe, that there was no help for it) the matter of deepest lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and so it was ever profest to be by both parties that were engaged in the war: for my own part I was so far from preaching Parliament and people into a War, that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured what I could to pray them out of it.</p>

nor do any thing like that which he speaks against in his quaking language.

               <p>I do not speak these things as desiring the straitning or affliction of those that are so bitter enemies unto us, but as eying the extream danger they are in of soul-destruction.

And we see a little the benefit of restraint, and what reason there is that Authority should therein du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exert it self, by late experience: For, a course being taken by the higher Powers, that no Minister should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted in the acting of his Office, the <hi>Quakers</hi> that so usually molested the publick Meetings, have forborn their former disturbances; so God is not provoked by those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts; our Congregations are free from those distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and the Quakers themselves from that sin, though they come still as neer it as they dare: But hereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the interposing of the Civill Powers is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Its one thing to desire freedome from a book of sports, another thing to desire freedome from the Book of God, as not willing to be led and ruled by it, but by a light within, or as desiring a liberty from that, which that word commands, or to that which it forbids.</p>

               <p>This being premised, I shall come to a more close and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> particular answer, Where 1.

At which enmity of Apostates, none should marvell, because Ministers stand so much in their way, and the very end of the the Ministery is to keep Christians from being carried about by flatulent Seducers in this windy world, Ephes. 4.11, 14.</p>
            <p>But as one evill begets another, so now very lately, this mishapen-birth, is followed with another like it self, that is, very deformed as the former, but much more audacious, as being prefaced and presented to the world with an addresse, <hi>To the Parliament of England now assembled at Westminster.</hi>

Further, none of us can say or do know that he urged the having of that which was given this year for another year; only he desired to have the value of the Tithes in money.</p>

            <p>I am sorry I have detained the Reader with a matter of so small moment, whereunto notwithstanding, in these dayes wherein every tale will serve the turn (with many) to make a Minister odious, there is some need to speak.

Particularly, three things come in here to be considered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What it is to follow an <hi>inward light</hi> separated from, and unagreeable to, <hi>Scripture light.</hi> That's so wilde and wicked a thing that it suggests at last, to sing <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> to a most sinfull man; for the Apology for that
<pb facs="tcp:64656:49"/>
singing is this, <hi>They that did sing were called to it by the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 18.</note>; and one of them saith, <hi>The power of the Lord carried me to sing and lead his Horse</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Dorcas Erbury</hi> cals that wretch, over and over again, <hi>The only begotten Son of God</hi>; and then, <hi>Lord and Master whom she is to serve,</hi> for the Spirit <hi>within her doth command her to call him so</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 19.</note>. It's true that Quakers say, they disown this abomination; but do they not own the principle that leads to it, to wit, a being led and instigated by that which is within them? Unto which what limits do they put?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What it is to have low thoughts of Gods word, and of the Preaching thereof, which God hath appointed to be the means of <hi>feeding his people with knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> Jer. 3.15. Such men quickly come to set up a Religion, and in the end a <hi>Jesus,</hi> of their own making; with this hellish Blasphemy, <hi>Thy name shall be no more James, but Jesus</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 19.</note>: Let every one whom it concerns weigh it well. Why may not he that now speaks scornfully of <hi>bowing down and crying Hosanna to the mutable directions of the Pulpit</hi> (as this Replyer doth, p. 2.) come at length to have others <hi>fall down upon the ground at his feet</hi> (as it is informed upon Oath, some did at <hi>Nailers</hi> feet <note n="*" place="margin">p. 23, 25.</note>) — yea, and to have <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna</hi> also sung to himself. He that cries out wickedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Ministers for persecuting Jesus, may come himself to be so wicked as to be named <hi>Jesus,</hi> and to have <hi>Hosanna</hi> sung before him; yea, he may come to such an height of pride and madness, as to <hi>take</hi> such honours, and defend the taking of them, saying as <hi>Nayler</hi> said, <hi>I may not refuse any thing that is moved of the Lord, and that their Father commanded them to do</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 15.</note>. I wish, and pray, that <hi>James Naylers</hi> just punishment may be [<hi>foelix flagellum</hi>] an happy Scourge to drive, yea (by grace) to draw him and his company not only from the highest <hi>risings,</hi> but from the lowest root and <hi>rise</hi> of ever-increasing errour.

            <p>I have now done with the Quakers, and intend not to make any further return to this <hi>Replyer.</hi> The old proverb is, <hi>It will weary an old man to follow a childe.</hi> I am sure it's very tedious to walk in and out after an unprincipled man, not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Religion at first, and led by phansie at last. If there be yet any thing that he can <hi>reasonably</hi> object, some or other (it's likely) will answer it (perhaps some honest Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant or Tradesman that loves the Ministery as much as he hates it) If he contend only in a way of railing and vaunting, therein he must be suffered to get the better, and he shall [for me] have the last word; only, if he make any further Reply upon me, I desire the Readers to do me so much right as to reflect on what I have already done, and to view my writings before they believe his. I told him formerly that I would not have further to do with him; that is, that I would not direct my speach to him (though I meant to make Answer to his Reply) but to the Reader for whose sake I wrote; hereafter I mean not to say any thing to him or of him. Let him first answer the Books that have been printed against his phansies already, and know that those Books (how mean soever he makes them) will not be answered by <hi>Bravadoes,</hi> or by <hi>counting the sheets</hi> and making the sum total <hi>wrath and confusion</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">As he doth in the Title page of his last Book.</note>; nor will the arguments in them be taken off with <hi>animosities, admirations,</hi> and <hi>outcries,</hi> which are his wayes of answer.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I am very sorry (that when my intentions were better, and I am sure I gave this impetuous man no cause by any thing I wrote or spake, to rave against the
<pb facs="tcp:64656:50"/>
whole Ministery, yet) that I should be any occasion to him of his abominable abuses and misapplications of the Holy Scriptures, and of powring forth so much corruption and virulency as he hath done, and (by a dreadful hardness of heart) is resolved still to do against Gods Officers, and Gods <hi>Ordinances,</hi> whereof the Ministery is one, Ephes. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
