            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I have looked upon the Scriblings of this
age as the fruits of ſome mens idleneſſe, and moſt
mens folly, and therefore ſhould not willingly
have owned my ſelfe, if found among that Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Yet when it grows ſo unlimitedly high, and
impudently brazen, that ſome men I know, men
even above flattery, and ſo ſleek &amp; ſmooth, in their uprightneſſe
(Among whom I place the preſent Generall and his Second) that
I had thought nothing of that kind could ſtick; and yet theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared

            <p>1. Two things I reſolved which now I offer to the World. The
firſt is an humble Petition to the Parliament, that they would
pleaſe to try their now well-backt authority, that ſome one faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
diſcreet man may be choſen to divulge Gazets, Corants, or
newes: who ſhall be accountable to the State for what he prints or
communicates to the Kingdome, and that two of each party (for
parties there are) ſhall undertake for what is Printed on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of either, that ſo all ſcandalous and ſlanderous perſonall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
may be avoyded, and matters worth time and reading may
be publiſhed; or if none of theſe may be gotten, at leaſt men may
put their names to their Papers; that honeſt men may know where
to find an accuſer, for <hi>ſi ſat ſit accuſare, quis erit innocens?</hi> I liſt not
to anſwer objections may be made hereunto, ſince this boundleſs
kind of boldneſſe were better curb'd to ſome inconvenience, then
continued to a miſchiefe, even the poyſoning the whole Nation:

2. My ſecond Reſolve is, though not to anſwer every late Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
punctually, which rather then doe, I might undertake to
cleanſe the ſtable in the ſtory: yea though my Share lies ſo much in
them, that it would be coſtly to purchaſe cleane handkerchiefs to
wipe off every ſpattering on my face, and could as ſhortly and

others daſhing and dogs barking: Yet to prevent ſtones from
ſpeaking, and graves from opening, or ſome horrid unheard of
thing from appearing, to ſatisfie the wide-mouth'd world, and
the black-mouth'd Pamphleteers. I ſhall in plaineneſſe and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
ſhew you the Armies wounds ſince they put up their ſword,
and with them the States diſeaſes; and in humility offer the cure,
and leave all to a wonder-working God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let me tell you negatively the evills commonly charged
upon the Army, are not the Armies evills. Wee have generally
<hi>Cauſam pro non cauſa,</hi> in which Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> was wont to exceed, who
ſpake much more then he meant to ſtand too: the ſumme of all
his is the Armies rebellion: another Pedanticke ſounds a Retreat,
who being nameleſſe will not endure a Charge; the marow of his
Divinity, Non-obedience; another brings the Army to the Barre,
where he pleads with a company of bal'd threatnings, and would
fright <hi>Fairfax</hi> with a ſight of a King at <hi>White-Hall;</hi> One cryes
they ſin againſt <hi>Caeſar;</hi> another, they have deflowred the <hi>Parliment;</hi>
another, they have raviſht the City; another, they are Sectaries,
enemies to Government, falſe to God, to man, friends, enemies to
themſelves. They have loſt <hi>Ireland,</hi> ruin'd <hi>England;</hi> oh! taxes and
free quarter; oh! this trinkling with the Court cryes one; oh!
their doubtfull carriage with the Court cryes another; Cavalliers
ſhall up cryes one; we ſhall never ſee good day ſayes another, I doe
not think <hi>Paul</hi> heard ſuch a confuſed noyſe, when himſelfe could
hardly get leave to ſpeake; That the word <hi>Army</hi> muſt anſwer all
the doubtfull miſchievous deadly queſtions in the World. For

which, as moſt inſiſted upon, ſo is moſt likely to have vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
acceptance: is the <hi>Armies</hi> diſobedience to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> by
which the State was endangered to looſe all conſiſtency; In reſpect
of which, the <hi>Apprentices</hi> routing the Houſe is but duty or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency;
or at worſt a parallell practice.</p>
            <p>To which this is my plaine and full anſwer.</p>
            <p>It is confeſt, they were not willing to disband at <hi>Walden,</hi> being
urged thereunto, and denyed in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> when expected and preſt:
But conſider. 1. It was required but conditionally, with regard
to their ſecurity, indempnity, and Arreare, and none of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
It was not ſuch a <hi>Monſtrum horerndum:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. They were free <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> as Souldiers, and muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their obligation to the State, as wel as anſwer the Major and
more corrupt Votes of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. Nature commanded their ſelfe-preſervation, when ſuch
Inſtruments were ſent to disband them, and command them for
<hi>Ireland,</hi> of whoſe non-integrity they had good experience.</p>
            <p>4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. When not long before they could not have leave to Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               </gap> not new unto them, when
the ſame practice was familiar from men more mercenary in the
North, and their denyall never counted rebellion: but glibly
ſwallowed.</p>
            <p>6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. I anſwer, and I deſire it may be obſerved: The firſt force
ever put upon the <hi>Parliament</hi> was long before this, and that neerer
hand: did not the City <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> hang like a Petard upon the
<hi>Parliament</hi> doore weeke after weeke, and every Ward in courſe to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116102:4"/>
attend and fire it; ſpeake (Gentlemen of the Houſe) how you
were accoſted and ſaluted, and in what language, till you were
forced to ſpeak pure <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. I doe here offer to make good upon oath, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
party in the Houſe, had more force put upon them to
disband us, then we put upon the Houſe in refuſing. For proofe
whereof, Maſter <hi>Anthony Nicholls</hi> lately with us at <hi>Kingſton</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his flight, being urged by my ſelfe before an other ſufficient
witneſſe, to ſpeak to this point, calling for a teſtimony from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)
Profeſt, that when the <hi>Army</hi> offered at firſt to goe for <hi>Ireland,</hi>
he with the other impeached Members fully condiſcended to it,
and they gave him the agitation thereof: but (as he proteſted) the
Miniſters in <hi>London</hi> came to them with violence, preſſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
upon this ground: That this <hi>Army</hi> would ſoone conquer
<hi>Ireland,</hi> fill it with Schiſmes: and not only command it: but in a
ſhort time give law to <hi>England:</hi> and therefore would heare of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the disbanding it, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> (quoth he) put us upon that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
courſe; Now who forced theſe Miniſters? I doe not ſay, but
you ſee who forced thoſe <hi>Parliament-men,</hi> &amp; we know they would
force the <hi>Army:</hi> and upon denyall the <hi>Army</hi> are the forcers. And
if the City-<hi>Remonſtraters</hi> durſt ſpeake, they can tell you who forced
them to force the <hi>Parliament:</hi> and if the <hi>Apprentices</hi> would breake
ſilence, they could tel you who ſpet in their mouths, and clapt them
on the back.</p>
            <p>In all this I ſpeake not my delight, but my griefe, that ſo many
Pulpits ſhould as plainly witneſſe this force, as Hiſtory tels us who
poyſoned King <hi>John.</hi> And though we have not been ignorant of
this kind of violence (which I had rather attribute to my Brethrens
zeale, then their malice) yet you ſee how tenderly wee have dealt
with thoſe: we knowing many godly amongſt them, who have
not yet declared againſt them, complained of one of them; Nay
though this <hi>Army</hi> from firſt to laſt never had any of theſe Brethren
to offer one Sermon to us to encourage in dangers, to rejoyce with
us in our ſucceſſe. Nay, though they know wee want helps, and
have been forced to uſe ſuch help, as they have reviled us for; and
ſo would have us make bricke without ſtraw; Nay though wee
know moſt hard meaſure met us. I doe profeſſe I conceive even
<hi>Gangraena</hi> himſelfe might have marcht through the <hi>Army</hi> unmole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116102:4"/>
though we are not ignorant: <hi>hinc noſtri ſundicalamitas.</hi> The
Lord pitty and pardon, the <hi>Army</hi> doth.</p>
            <p>8<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Laſtly, the <hi>Army</hi> durſt not disband, not ſeeing a ſuitable
power to ſtand betwixt honeſt men and their dangers; the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
not poſſeſt by men of truſt, and the 5000. horſe intended
not in ſuch hands as to be wiſhed: and the beſt of them might bee
ſoone disbanded when the foot ſcattered.</p>
            <p>No, no, this is not the <hi>Armies</hi> wound or ſore; and to anſwer
the Retreaters grand queſtion, <hi>whence are Wars.</hi> I anſwer with the
Apoſtle <hi>James;</hi> and adde Peace begets plenty, plenty, pride, and
pride, warre, and warre begets peace, and ſo round againe. The
Schoole-boy that helped him to ſo many Latine ends out of <hi>Tully,</hi>
can anſwer a harder <hi>Quaere:</hi> but ſince hee pretends to Religion, I

18.</hi> Why cannot he as well ſpeak to a brother offending, and ſo
tell him, as to tell all the world of him; I have beene ſatisfied in
mine own ſpirit, that the godly could not be much offended with
us, ſince none have taken the liberty of ſpeaking to us, which I
dare ſay from the Generall to the meaneſt Officer, profeſſing god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,

            <p>But I looke upon that Author as great a ſtranger to the <hi>Armie,</hi>

toleration the <hi>Armies</hi> Gangraena, when as they never hindred the
State from a State Religion, having onely wiſhed to enjoy now
what the Puritans beg'd under the Prelates: when we deſire more,
blame us, and ſhame us. Neither was it the evill of the <hi>Army,</hi> that
being modell'd, they ſuddenly clos'd, and marcht at that time
when the boldeſt complainer now, would have given them two
parts of what they had to have ſecured the third; (Friends) it
was not their evill to divide part of their Force to <hi>Taunton,</hi> &amp; with
another part to fight at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> and after that (by Gods bleſſing)
to deliver up a free Kingdome to an ungratefull Inhabitant, and to

            <p>It may be ſome of us have had our Lordly diſh in <hi>Jaels</hi> Tent,
and our head may be nayled to the ground; wee may thinke
(the war being ended) we may begin to look to our own comforts,
and ſubſiſtance, and we are apt to plead, who ſhall enjoy honour
and other advantages: but thoſe that have wonne them through
hazards, and think they may be confided in; It may be ſome of us
looke upon our ſhops and Trades as things below us. Wee want
that communion with God, and one with another which we had
in ſad hours: we are forgetfull of our mercies: we may be apt to
quarrell one with the other for want of an enemy.</p>
            <p>We may have ſuch a neighbor of the Court, as ſome of us may
be Planet-ſtruck, yet I hope not principle ſhaken; we may wander
too much from our own firſt undertakings in the opinion of others.</p>
            <p>We are not without varieties of thoughts about the matters of
God, which never appear'd when we had no time for talking, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo much to doe and act. We cannot (we confeſſe) live beyond
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116102:5"/>
our frailties in many kinds. To be ſhort, we have prayed more,
loved more, believed more then we doe. We are grown effeminate
with eaſe, and are more cowed with a dead dog, then wee have
been with a living Lyon. We are leſſe in heaven and more in earth,
and theſe truely are our wounds deare friends.</p>
            <p>Some other diſeaſes there are as much conſiderable among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

            <p>5. A generall want of the fear of God, and that ſpirit of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

threatens ruine very much.</p>
            <p>7. Unwarranted Jealouſies of all men and all actions: yea

            <p>8. Common unthankfulneſſe &amp; ingratitude to God and man,
I feare ſhortly the greateſt errour in the Kingdome, will be the

            <p>9. Delay to the diſtreſſed, making them more miſerable then

            <p>10. A ſpirit of lying and falſe witneſſe-bearing, reaching to
the undervaluing of our enjoyments, to ſay <hi>England</hi> is growne ſo

<hi>Northern</hi> winds, our treaſure is yet in the Kingdome: <hi>London</hi> as

               <head>The Cure may lye in theſe?</head>
               <p>The Army (you ſay) muſt yet be maintained, and wee have
thought of Eſtabliſhments, &amp;c. to take off all offences occaſioned
by the Army; either you muſt find action for it, which will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
much, or repartite it upon ſeveral Counties according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
that every County may know their owne men and their
charge, by which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have kept their Army theſe 70.
or 80. yeares; I have formerly anſwered all objections may bee
made againſt it. The immediate pay of the Souldier in every
County, as it will cut off many unneceſſary charges, ſo it wil
be eaſie and contentfull to both parties, I meane the Souldier and
the Land-lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Good men, not good Lawes muſt ſave Kingdomes:
not that I would ſeparate them; therefore I thinke that the firſt
work to be attended: For as the <hi>Venetians</hi> live upon their curious
elections: ſo the <hi>Netherlands</hi> by keeping their governement in ſuch
hands as they doe, though perpetuating offices to them, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
dangerous. Good Juſtices, good Majors, &amp;c. had it been our
firſt work, it would have been our beſt, &amp; <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> can as ſoon
conform to juſt &amp; honeſt government as any other people. See it in
the <hi>Army,</hi> how ſerviceable the worſt impreſt men have been under
example, and Characters to be given out for the Elector, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and for the manageing of chiefer Burgeſſes. What if every
fifty in every County choſe one to chooſe for them, &amp;c. moſt men
being ignorant of the worthieſt men.</p>
               <p>3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. That all men from the higheſt to the loweſt may know
what they may truſt too without delay, and to truſt God with
the management of it if according to his will.</p>
               <p>4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Tithes or ſomething of Analogy to them brought into a
common ſtock in every County will doe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> keepe a
good proportion of money ready in every County, &amp; content the
Preacher and his Widow better, when in Towns 200.<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. or 150.<hi rend="sup">l</hi>.
<hi>per annum,</hi> and in the Pariſh 100.<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. ſhall certainely be paid, and
40.<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. to the Widow, &amp;c. as in other Countreys they doe, and
hence raiſe a ſtock to ſet the poor on work in every County, the
want of which hath been ſo much complained of.</p>
               <p>5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That Salaries may be appointed to all places of truſt, that
temptations to deceit take not hold of Officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:116102:6"/>
6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. A Committee for union betwixt all men truely godly; that
we may ſwim in one Channell (which is in hand) with free and
loving debates allowed in every County, that wee may convince,
not confound each other, two or three Itinerary Preachers
ſent by the State into every County: and a Committee of godly
men, Miniſters, Gentlemen and others, to ſend out men of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
holineſſe, and parts, into all Countreyes recommended from
their teſt.</p>
               <p>7<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Three men yearely choſen in every Pariſh to take up diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
which may be called friend-makers, as they do in other
places with good ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>8<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That the Cuſtomes (by which great ſums come to hand)
may be in very choiſe hands, and their Under-officers in all parts
may be preſented from thoſe Ports to them: and out of 2. or 3. ſo
preſented, they chooſe one, if not juſt exception againſt him.</p>
               <p>9<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That my former modell for the Navy may be review'd and
accepted, which was preſented about two years ſince, whereby the
Navies debts may be paid, and two parts of three in the charge ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for future, and the work better done.</p>
               <p>10<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That Merchants may have all manner of encouragement,
the law of Merchants ſet up, and ſtrangers, even <hi>Jewes</hi> admitted
to trade, and live with us, that it may not be ſaid we pray for their
converſion, with whom we will not converſe, wee being all but
ſtrangers on the Earth.</p>
               <p>11<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That Forraign Nations may have due reſpect by all faire
correſpondences with them, and Intelligencers kept among them,
eſpecially that <hi>Scotland</hi> may be uſed in al things as neighbours and
friends, though not as Maſters and Commanders.</p>
               <p>12. That <hi>Academies</hi> may be ſet up for Nobility and Gentry,
where they may know piety and righteouſneſſe, as well as gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Court-ſhip; wee commonly fetch over the dirt of <hi>France,</hi>
rather then their Excellencies, and that ſhorter wayes to learning
may be advance'd; and that godlineſſe in youth give them place in
Colledges before letters and importunity of men.</p>
               <p>13. That the worke of <hi>Ireland</hi> may not thus ſtill be made a
mock-work: but that the buſineſſe may be carried on ſtrenuouſly &amp;
vigorouſly by men to be confided; who may take it upon them by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116102:7"/>
the great, or day-work, either of theſe; there are good men will
undertake it upon them, if fully countenanced with a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine
and ſome money; for what we ſend now is but like a worm
in a hollow tooth, it takes up no jaw?</p>
               <p>14. That no Magiſtrate in matters of Religion meddle further
then as a nurſing Father, and then all children ſhall be fed, though
they have ſeverall faces and ſhapes.</p>
               <p>15. That all men intruſted, may have ſet time, place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
appoynted to give up their accounts unto, of their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>16. Since the vaſt and even incomprehenſible affaires of this
Kingdome by the preſent Councell, muſt have ſo many agitations
and ſo many varieties paſſe upon them; two wayes it may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
1. If nothing be taken into the Houſes conſideration but <hi>res
verè arduae,</hi> wherin the heart-blood of the Kingdome runs, and no
petty matters.</p>
               <p>2. If a Councell of State of 10. or 12. honeſt and godly well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſt
men might ſit neer the Houſe, and theſe, not inveſted with
power, might commend matters of high concernment to the Houſe,
and receive their ſcruples, and thoſe to ſtate alſo government of
Churches.</p>
               <p>17. That Burgeſſes of <hi>Parliament</hi> may be better proportioned,
6. 4. or two for Shires, and ſome for great Cities, that they give
monthly ſome account to the places intruſting them, and that
ſome Lawes may be probationers for a month or two.</p>
               <p>18. That ſome of the <hi>Parliament</hi> may be appointed to receive
ſuch ſuggeſtions from friends for the good of the whole, which
they cannot conſtantly bring in by way of Petition.</p>
               <p>19. That priſoners, eſpecially for debt, may have diſpatches, &amp;
not looſe heads, hearts and hands as well as heeles in Gaoles, and
that the Creditour may maintain them in priſon: that poore
Thieves may not be hang'd for 13.<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ob</hi>. but that a Gally or two
may be provided to row in the River or Channell, to which they
may be committed, or employed in drayning lands, or baniſhed.</p>
               <p>It were alſo to be wiſhed that our Gentry find our Callings, and
that younger brothers may be better provided for by their parents,
that ſome of them fall not on learning &amp; the Miniſtry as a ſhift, &amp;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116102:7"/>
ſome (which is worſe) take up their employments in high wayes,
or (at beſt) peſter <hi>Ireland</hi> or Forreigne Plantations; and all to
maintaine the paintry and gliſter of the Family, and too often to
keep up the name and honour of it in a ſottiſh and luxurious heire.</p>
               <p>20. Quicke Juſtice makes quiet Common-wealths; I look
upon that as contenting the <hi>Hollanders</hi> under their vaſt Taxes, &amp;
Exciſes; what they have they can keepe; where (in every Towne)
you may get Juſtice as often and as naturally as their Cowes give
milke; The few advocates in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> will tell you what little
uſe they make of Lawyers, where I have knowne a Merchant dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for 30000. pound <hi>per annum,</hi> &amp; in ſeven yeares not ſpend
20. ſhillings in Law.</p>
               <p>And if I might not offend the Court and Gentry, I would
ſay the wrapping up of ſo many of them in Gownes, and ſcufling
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> is rather a mark of their meaneneſſe and Jejune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and our ſlavery and folly, then of any Nationall glory;
That to this day wee can neither buy nor ſell, convey nor make
Teſtaments, without great and queſtionable Parchments? And
for Law muſt <hi>jurare in verba,</hi> either of <hi>Littleton, Cooke,</hi> or Caſuiſt,
<hi>ejuſdem farinae,</hi> which would finde a Cure in keeping Records in
all Counties of all mens eſtates and alienations, &amp;c. and thoſe
tranſmitted to a grand or leiger Record at <hi>Weſtminſt:</hi> the ſtrength
and time ſpent in Term quarrells, were better beſtowed upon the
Weſt Indies to which we have beene ſo often called, and would
ſoone make an end of Europes troubles by drying up that Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates.</p>
               <p>I know not what engagements the King hath upon any, nor
how the entercourſe lyes: but before the cloſe of new addreſſes, I
wiſh the people might have two things granted them, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. To underſtand by ſome wiſe Statiſt what the true <hi>Engliſh</hi>
of prerogative, priviledge and liberty is. If theſe three bawling
children were well brought to bed, the whole houſe would bee
quiet.</p>
               <p>2. That a certaine time might be appointed to chuſe their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
undenyably if they pleaſe to make uſe of it, with writs or
without: what year this ſhall begin I ſay not: but if not granted,
you ſhall hardly keepe tyranny out of doores.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:116102:8"/>
To cloſe all and cure all; would this Nation but follow the
plaine foote-ſteps of providence in one thing, the worke were
done.</p>
               <p>Let us but conſider whither the Lord hath not pointed out his
worke unto us, <hi>viz.</hi> putting righteous men into places of truſt,
making way thereunto, as if the fulfilling of the many propheſies
and the expectation of the juſt, were now to be anſwered. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
the firſt and now ſecond gaubling the Parliament, the like in
the City, the ſame in the Armie, not leſſe in the Miniſtry, as in the
choiſe of <hi>Jeſſe's</hi> ſons: neither this nor that muſt ſerve but the
leaſt, that the whole Kingdome hath been in the refiners fire. The
Lord would doe us good againſt our wills: but wee content our
ſelves to give him a Female when wee have a Male in the flocke:
This broke the Axle-tree of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State and Church, and
that bought <hi>Akeldama.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However I am confident God will carry on this work which is
his owne, and to that end I looke above all preſent agitations,
knowing if we enter into our chambers, and ſhut our doores for a
little moment the indignation ſhall be over-paſt.</p>
