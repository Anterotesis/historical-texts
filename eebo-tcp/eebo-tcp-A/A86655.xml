            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now thoſe who then were Prieſts, and ſhould have bin teachers and leaders of the people to fear God, and hear his Word, and obſerv his ſigns, and repent that the Judgments might be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they were the only men that hated, reproached, perſecuted, and called the prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles madmen, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, becauſ of theſe things, which into their wiſdomes could not enter, and ſtirred up the Rulers and ignorant people againſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they might put them to death as it is at this day, but theſe in our dayes are more inexcuſable then all that ever went before them, inaſmuch as they had no Scripture to ſhew them that the Lord had commanded ſuch ſignes formerly; but theſe have the Scriptures that witneſſe to the ſame thing; which ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they make a trade on, and cry up in words, but are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that Spirit by which they were acted that gave them forth, and envie and perſecute that obedience that was acted in them, in whom it is now acted; and they might as well cry out againſt <hi>Eſay</hi> for a mad-man, becauſe he went naked at the word of the Lord, and the reſt of the prophets and ſervants of God for acting ſuch weak and fooliſh things, to their wiſdom, as they did as againſt theſe for obeying the Lord in the ſame or the like things whatſoever, for God is not tied to any rule to walk by, but his own will; and where he commands wo to him that doth not obey, and where he commands not, woe to him that acts in his own will, and ſaith, it is the Word of the Lord.

every one that comes into the world, which light did lead all Saints into purity, and up to God, and this you call Natural, and them who witneſs redemption by the Son, you call blaſphemers; Chriſt which you profeſs and yet know not, was accounted by your generation a blaſphemer, and all the Apoſtles and Saints were perſecuted by your generation as evil doers, as deſpiſers of Government, as diſturbers of the peace, as leaders of the people into iniquity, as the off-ſcouring of all things, as ſheep for the ſlaughter, and were al of them put to death and in priſon by that generation which profeſſed God, and ſaid they had his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet ſlew them who profeſſed him and kept his ſtatutes; for if ye be not wilfully blind, are ye not doing the ſame now; mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, haling, impriſoning, bringing before Magiſtrates them that witneſs Jeſus Chriſt in them, and becauſ they bear witneſs againſt all ſin; Did ever any of the Saints of God perſecute, impriſon, or hale before Magiſtrates, and falſly acuſe any? Did ever the ſaints complain to Authority to guard them? Hear ye whited tombs, ye painted ſepulchres, what Goſpel is this ye profeſs? what God is this ye ſerv that muſt be defended with clubs, ſwords, Rulers, and carnal weapons; the Saints who had the everlaſting Goſpel, ſaid, their weapons were not carnal but ſpiritual, and yet they were mighty through God to beat down ſtrong holds, even principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers, thrones and dominions; but your Goſpell and Miniſtry can do nothing without a ſword; All people ſee where you are, &amp; what you are doing, you run headlong to ruine; thoſe who were deſpiſed by that generation of Phariſees &amp; Profeſſors which you are in, were a burthenſom ſtone, upon which all that oppoſed did break themſelves; ſo this generation whom ye ſet at nought, ye ſhalbe made to bow and throw down your Crowns before them, and before the Lamb who is our Leader &amp; guider, Glory unto him for evermore; its hard for you to kick againſt the pricks, for we witneſs the two edged Sword of the Lord ſhall bathe it ſelf in the blood of his Enemies, and ſhalbe made fat with ſlaughter. O ye Mountains ye ſhall become a plain for the ranſomed to come over you; all your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſhall be as ſtubble, and you ſhall be left naked and bare, and nothing ſhall be able to cover you, becauſe you are crucifiers of Chriſt and the Saints, repent that you may be hid in the day of his fierce anger, which is to come upon all the workers of iniquity.</p>
