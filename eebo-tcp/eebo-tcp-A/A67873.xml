            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe unhappy Causes of the present neglect of this most noble knowledge, are of so high nature, as will not endure to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: the ill consequents (in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent degenerateness of this Age) so manifest, that they need not. In this declining condition of Honour, nothing is more requisite then the means of its


<pb facs="tcp:121170:7"/>
preservation; amongst which this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, and that not inconsiderable, gave me occasion of busying my self in this design.</p>
            <p>Such bookes as have beene already publisht, by persons eminent in this kinde, are of large bulke, and some of them too tedious to the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Student. The more they comprehend, the less apt for memory: especially when enlarged with tedious impertinencies, and doubtlesse more difficult for the apprehension of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reader; to which, <hi>Method</hi> that is most discernable in brevity is the most excellent help. That which I have herein followed, is to treat first of the degrees of <hi>Honour,</hi> and then of <hi>Armory;</hi> and that although con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely, yet I hope so clearly, and fully, that any person of ordinary


<pb facs="tcp:121170:7"/>
capacity may hereby be able to blazon a Coat of the greatest difficulty; the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care being in observing the termes given to things born, and the manner of posture, and position. Some errors have escaped both the Press, and theGraver, which the Reader may at his leisure rectifie by the Errata at the end; so let him peruse seriously, and censure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly; and then I shal wish him Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>

            <head>Of <hi>HONOR</hi> in Generall, and of its Particular Divisions.</head>
            <p>THe Heraulds of former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have, many of them, not onely divided the nobler sort of men into severall degrees, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished likewise the inferiour rank into four forms: But (as in some other things) in that also I shall forbear to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their method, as not altogether so perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the intentions of this compilement. It is but an easie caution in me, when I know not how few I shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>The great and wise Disposer of all Entities hath contriv'd every thing into such a Method, as in every particle of the Creation is discover'd a most excellent harmony, in which that of the degrees and honorary distinctions is as admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as any; and this is the intended scope of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

variety in all things, that by a rule of contraries they might the better display themselves. Some men he hath richly adorn'd with Excellency, and elevated them with the sublimary glories of Honor, Nobility, and Greatness; and others again (in the same light they shine) hath he obscured with contraries of Meanness, Ignobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Indigency. Of the latter I shall onely say, that for them to Spurn at the more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, because themselves are debased to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority, is to kick dirt in the face of that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely just and wise God of our Creation. The first being the intended concernment, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear any farther discourse of the latter.</p>
            <p>Nobility (saith Sir <hi>John Fern</hi>) is thus defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">Fern. <hi>Glo. Gen. p.</hi> 4.</note>

In short, amongst all men it is defined, A certain eminence of some above the rest.</p>
            <p>This is by the same Author distinguished into three <hi>Species,</hi> Nobility supernaturall, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility naturall, and Nobility civill or politicall. Supernaturall, as in the heavenly Hierarchies, or sacred Principalities: And that there are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <note place="margin">

               </note> and degrees amongst them, we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or renounce our Christianity; but I leave the further discovery thereof (as too sublime) to more mature and deliberate contemplations.</p>
            <p>The second is <hi>Nobilitas physica,</hi> or naturall Nobility; consisting in the great variety of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall creatures, obvious to our human senses.

As for example, Among the Planets, the Sun is the most noble; among the Elements, Fire; among the Plants, the Cedar; among Flowers, the Rose; of Metalls, Gold; of Jems, the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond; of Fish, the Dolphin; of Birds, the Eagle; of Beasts, the Lion; and amongst Men, the King.</p>
            <p>The last is Nobility civill or politicall, which onely relates to Mankind; and though some have distinguished the generality of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth into two divisions onely, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Ignoble, the Gentry and Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet either part are again subdivided, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the policy of civill Government, as well as the providence of divine Ordination.</p>
            <p>When first this distinction came amongst us, is by some thought uncertain; but for my part, not. For doubtlesse it hath been continued from the first encrease of Mankind in the world; for if there were Kings and Governors, certainly other distinctions, (vertue being still admired, and honored, and some signall put <note place="margin">

            <p>And that there were Kings long before the Floud, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (that excellent Master of Antiquity) is of opinion, is evident by those words he inserts, which signifie, that <hi>Adam,</hi> after the propagation of Mankind, was esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">

            <p>Now as Nobility by Blood and Merit is justly esteemed the most honorable, so certainly this the least; the glory they shine in, being but the reflection of their Ancestors, and not their own proper <hi>rayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither are dignities and discents of blood <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> enough to ennoble us, for whatsoever is not within us cannot justly be called ours, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the graces and goods of fortune. <hi>Genus &amp; proavos, &amp; quae non fecimus ipsi, Vix <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>And certainly the Honor atchieved by an Ancestor, livs in his Family as his, and to the memory of his vertues, and example of theirs; which ought doubly to oblige them to care, first, in keeping that tenderly, which their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors purchased so difficulty; and to shew themselves the true heirs of such noble spirits, in their due imitations of those renowned vertues.</p>

Therefore it is but vain for a man to boast, that he can derive the foundation of his honor from the renowned catalogue of worthy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, and himself degenerate from their heroicall virtues; for at the best they blaze but another's honor, and their own shame; and may quickly be answered as <hi>Hermodius</hi> was by <hi>Iphierates,</hi> (who upbraided him with the stain of so base a parent) My House taketh beginning in me, but thine taketh end in thy <note place="margin">Fern <hi>p.</hi> 1.</note> self.</p>

            <p>Now these two qualities meeting in one man, is it that maketh the perfect Gentleman; and such a man ought to be preferred before all <note place="margin">Nobility mixt, Sir <hi>J. Fern.</hi>
               </note> others in the receiving of Dignity, Office, or Rule, in the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Wherefore by the Laws of Arms antiently, these seven circumstances were regarded in the chioce of a Captain or Leader; his Age, his Virtues, his Faith or Allegiance, his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Martiall Discipline, his Authority, his good Fortune; and lastly, his Blood and Gentry.</p>
            <p>And antiently none were admitted into the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> but who were Gentlemen of Blood, be their Merits what ever; as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of some of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Therefore it is the best Patrimony a Father can leave his Son, to bequeathe him the glory of his merits, with the state of Gentility; And the best honor the Son can do to the deceased Parent, is, to continue his name in that estate which his Ancestors left him, and by imitating the virtues that obtained it, to preserve it without a stain.</p>
            <p>Which consideration hath been the occasion to stir up many generous spirits to a noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and commendable emulation, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt

               </hi> hath taken too much care, I think, in demonstrating; for whose sake I shall take as little: First, he tells you of all the Cardinall virtues, and then what they are; which I am so confident as to believe, every man understands, that knows any thing: But I shall take up this conclusion, as that from them, as a true Fountain, these Rivers must flow; for there is such a connexion and chain of affinity in these virtues, that none may be severed from the rest, and that man may be truly said to be virtuous; though, Like as the body is conserved by the nourishment of the four Elements or Complexions, so that the extinguishment of any one of them is destruction to the body; yet the constitution of that body is generally tearmed from the predominancy of some one of them that is most erninent in him: So, the vertues of a man may be esteemed from the paticular discovery of someone more eminent. But if we will make any difference in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Atchievment, it may be best done in short, by taking notice onely of Prudence and Fortitude, from whence that generall opinion of the world, that Merit was onely by the Pike or Pen, is derived.</p>
            <p>And though it has ever been a dispute, to which of these the precedency should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; yet, I think, a little reason will decide it, For though there hath been so much of Honor allowed in all Ages to Prudence, yet we ever


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:121170:13"/>
found the first succession of Honor was from the atchievments of Fortitude, as in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Roman</hi> Statues; and at this day the publick example of the Shield, whereon all, both Civill and Military, do illustrate their atchievments, which should be enough to end that controversie; though some have been very violent in a dispute to prefer the Doctor to be before the Knight.</p>
            <p>To obtain estate of Gentility by learning, and discovering the secrets of Heaven, is very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable certainly; but to atchieve it by service in his Soveraign's Wars, the defence of the Church, King, and Country, is of all most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and worthy.

               </gap> is the true spurre to perfection.</p>
            <p>This hath been for its sublimity reckoned with much honour among the liberall Sciences, by many Princes; nay, <hi>Pliny</hi> calls it plainly, a liberall art, whose reasons not his own onely, <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Paul Lomazzo p. 14.</hi>
               </note> but modern times have approved: &amp; much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son there is to give it that honour, since its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is by the exact engagement of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, Arithmetick, Perspective, and indeed all points and <hi>species</hi> of natural Philosophy; besides the remembrance of the great estimation it was in amongst the Grecians, whose Kings (many of them) were proud in professing the Art.</p>

            <p>Other examples, that Princes have given of their delight in it, is declared in the Ingenuity of <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Emanuel,</hi> Kings of <hi>France;</hi> and

            <p>And since from the seat of Royalty and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, all honours do flow, it is no reason this Fountain should by any restriction be limited, neither is it; for as before in the discourse of Gentility, by Patent it is signified, so there is another sort of Gentility, made by the Prince, which as it is by Patent, ought to have taken place there; but being by purchase only, and not of merit, is esteemed of all the most inferior, and therefore to be set in the lowest degree.</p>

Law for the descents in Noble Families. Which <hi>Tully</hi> esteemed the most excllent, of which Law a Gentleman of blood and Coat-Armor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect possessing virtue was only priviledged.</p>
               <p>To the making of which Gentleman per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in his blood, was required, a lineall descent on the part of his Fathers side, from <hi>Atavus, Abavus, Proavus, Avus,</hi> and <hi>Pater;</hi> and as much on his Mothers line: then is he not only a Gentleman of blood perfect, but of ancestors too.

               <p>As to the Student of the Law, Sir <hi>John Fern</hi> allowes him the best assurance of his Title of Gentleman, of all these irregular and untriall Gentlemen, (as he terms them;) for so much as in some Acts of Parliament he is named with the Title of Gentleman, yet he saith, that he is also debarred from all honor and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law of Armes.</p>

               <p>OF the distinctions by Knighthood there are many in other parts of the World; but in <hi>England</hi> only these, Knights Batchelers, Knights of the Bath, Knights Bannerets, and Knights Baronets, and Knights of the Garter.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Knight,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> saith, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Saxon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <note place="margin">Seld. <hi>Tit. Ho. p.</hi> 769. Camb. <hi>Brit. p.</hi> 170.</note> because their service was military.

The Italians call them <hi>Cavalari,</hi> the French <hi>Chevaliers,</hi> the Germans Kutters, and our Britans in Wales, Margagh, all of Riding. Englishmen only term them Knights, by a word, that in old English-language, as also of the German, signifieth indifferently a Servitour, or Minister, and a lusty young man. Hereupon it cometh, that in the old written Gospels tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into the Saxon, we read, for Christs disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Christs leorning knights.

Lands with this condition, that they should serve their Lords on Horseback, and so by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off a piece of the name, (as our delight is to speak short) this name of Knight remained with us. But whence it came that our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should, in penning the Laws, and all Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings since the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest's time, term those Knights in Latin <hi>Milites,</hi> that is, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, was transferred unto those that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing near about the Princes person bare any of the great Offices in the Prince's Court or Train.</p>
               <p>But with us, I conceive, those were first so called, who held any Lands or Inheritances in Fee, by this Tenure, To serve in the War, for those Lands were tearmed Knights Fees: and those that elsewhere they named Feuditary, that is, Tenants in Fee, were hete called <hi>Milites,</hi> that is, Knights; as for example, <hi>Milites Regis; Milites Archiepiscopi Cantuar.

               <p>The Roman Knights also were allowed to wear a Chain of Gold, and therefore called <hi>Torquati,</hi> from <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> who wore the first, obtained by him in a victory in <hi>France,</hi> which is by us yet imitated in the collar of <hi>S S.</hi> by which it is easily collected, that the true institution of it was a reward of Honor and Valour, not Sloath and Riches.

               <p>This Honor of Baronady is of three kinds; <note place="margin">Seg. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 223.</note> by Tenure, by Creation, and by Writ.</p>
               <p>Barons by Tenure are the Barons Spirituall, as I said before, which are reputed Peers of the Realm, and were ever first in nomination, and take place on the Prince's right hand in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and have been capable of temporall

                  </hi> opinion is, that not long after the Grand Charter of King <hi>John,</hi> the Law for excluding all Tenants in chief was made.</p>
               <p>From whence came that other dignity of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons by Writ, the King summoning whom he pleased, though he were but a private Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Knight, as many Seculars, Priors, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, and Deacons also; all which have been fince omitted, that held nothing of the King in chief, or Grand Tenure.</p>
               <p>This title of Baron by Writ is by some esteemed onely temporary, <hi>pro termino Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti;</hi> but that cannot be, for the ceremony of his admittance signifies more than a titular or temporary Honor, which is this; He is first brought by the Garter-King at Arms in his Soveraign Coat, to the Lord Chancellor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two of the youngest Barons, who bear the Robe of a Baron; there he shews his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, which the Chancellor reads, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulates him as a Baron, and invests him with those Robes, and sends him to take his place. Then the Writ is delivered to the Clerk of the Parliament, and he by the Garter shewed to the Barons, and placed in the House; and from thence is this title allowed him as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary.</p>
               <p>Since these two sorts of Barons in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, hath another been esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, which is Barons by Patent, and indeed more usuall in our latter times than those by

               <p>As concerning the descent of this Honor, and the extension of it, it many times descends to heirs female, as when there is no speciall entail on the heirs male; yet then no husband of that heir female shall enjoy the style and honor in right of his wife, unlesse he have issue by her, as it was decreed by Henry the eighth, in the case of Mr. <hi>Wimbry,</hi> for the style of the Lord <hi>Talboyes.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But this Imperiall Crown hath not been long in use among us, though our Kings have have had Imperiall Commands, as over <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ireland, Man,</hi> and other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Crowns formerly were but the same in a manner with that of an Earl now.</p>
               <p>Neither is it to be found, that any such thing as a Diadem was in use at all, till the time of <hi>Constantine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

is most certain, a white silk Fillet about the brows, which was an ordinary way to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them, as I have my self seen Statues of the Emperor, with such a kind of Fillet about the head.</p>
               <p>From whence is that which we read, that <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> took off his white Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, to cure the madness of <hi>Seleucus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first that was Crowned with this kind of Imperiall Crown, floryed and arched, was <hi>Henry</hi> the third, say some; but others, <hi>Henry</hi> the first: and indeed it is left disputable to me, so by me to others.</p>
               <p>However, it is very probable and plain, that the antientest Ensign of Regall Authority was the Scepter; which is every where spoken of, both in the Scriptures and profane Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>There is another Ensign of their Authority, which is a Globe with a Cross, in use amongst us ever since <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, which is placed in the left hand, as is seen in most of their Coyns; the Cross denoting his Faith, and the Globe his Empire both by Sea and <note place="margin">Ibid. cap <hi>8.</hi>

Besides, for an addition to the honor of a King, there is the same state allowed to a Queen, during the life of her husband, as to a Queen absolute almost, and is allowed a Crown.

               <p>NOw lest I should be thought malitious to a Sex I owe much honor to, before I conclude, I shall take some short observations more then already I have.

               <p>The honorable Feminine Dignities are,


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:121170:50"/>
Princesse, Dutchesse, Marchionesse, Countesse, Vicountesse, and Baronesse. Which are either by Creation, by Descent, or by Marriage.</p>
               <p>This honor by Creation, as it is rare amongst us, so it is more rarely taken notice of, though <note place="margin">Cart. <hi>21.</hi> Rich. <hi>2.</hi> mem. <hi>12.</hi> num. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> many examples have been; as <hi>Richard</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond created <hi>Margaret</hi> Countesse of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> into the title of Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> See the Charter in Mr. <hi>Selden.

                  <hi>Fern</hi> takes no notice, though else he discourses largely enough.</p>
               <p>By Descent, we have continuall examples: When any daughter of an Earl or Vicount shall continue a Virgin, or marry an Esquire, she shall retain that honor that springs from her father's blood, take place according; and be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by the Title of Lady.</p>
               <p>Which word <hi>Lady</hi> came from <hi>Hleaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> or <hi>Leafdian,</hi> by contraction in the <hi>Teuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi> and so <hi>Lafdy,</hi> and thence <hi>Lady,</hi> as from

It seems, from that they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led those persons, that for their quality could entertain others, and distribute corn and bread to their neighbours, by that Title.</p>
               <p>And of old, though in the Empire, and here, the word <hi>Dominus</hi> was used in generall for salutation amongst men of all sorts, yet <hi>Domina</hi> onely to persons of honor amongst <note place="margin">Bract. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>de Coron.</hi> 116.</note> women; as the widows of all Tenants in chief, and daughters and heirs of all Knights, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The heirs females of any Count or Baron, <note place="margin">Ib. de acq. rer. Dom. lib. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>34.</hi>
                  </note> shall enjoy both the Estate divided, and Titles too, if they be to be divided; and they shall be enjoyed by their husbands, if they marry, in the right of their wives.</p>
               <p>So that if there be two, or three, or more si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to share the estate, and the honors and dignities inherent be enough, they shall enjoy every one, one; as in the case of the Earldom of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and now the Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> of the North, by the same right enjoys the title of the Lord <hi>Conyers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this holds not; when the title is held by <hi>Jus gladii,</hi> or Knight's service; or if the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor be in any Castle or place onely, it cannot be divided, but falls and dissolves in the Crown, or left to the disposing of the King. And again, if the estate of honor and dignity be not descending to the heirs generall, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd to the heirs male, it cannot be the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a daughter, as many times it is.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:121170:51"/>
But we may understand this the better by that more eminent demonstration of high Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Kingdom, which descending by inheritance on the heirs generall, have been challenged by the husbands of heirs female, in right of their wives, the Descent-male failing; as in the case of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, challenging the <note place="margin">Dier's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</hi> 283. <hi>b.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Office of Lord Steward descended to <hi>Blaunch,</hi> daughter of <hi>Hen.</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> in whose right <hi>Joh.</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> her husband enjoy'd it.</p>
               <p>So the Office of Earl Marshall descended to the house of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> by an heir female; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being forfeited by treason, was conferred to the Lords <hi>Howards</hi> of <hi>Arundell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this and all such Descents, where there are not dignities enough to allow a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to all the Sisters, but the Honor shall be undividable; it shall descend to the eldest, or be disposed by the King to which he please.</p>
               <p>And for ennobling by birth, these rules are observed: That if a Gentleman, Knight, or Baron, do marry a wife of ignoble parents, she shall enjoy the title, name, and dignity of her husband: For, saith Sir <hi>John Fern,</hi> let the wife <note place="margin">Glory of Generosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>fol.</hi> 62.</note> be shining and glorious with the dignities of her husband: Whereas, on the contrary, if a Gentlewoman of blood and Coat-Armor shall marry a Francklin, Yeoman, or the like, that <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> is ignoble, having no Coat-Armor, his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no whit advanced by marriage in point

                  <hi>of honor;</hi> Although let him be inferior to her <note place="margin">Coke 4. <hi>part.</hi> 118. <hi>b.</hi> 6. <hi>part.</hi> 53. <hi>b. ibid.</hi>
                  </note> whom she shall marry, yet she shall retain the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, state, and dignity she was born to.</p>
               <p>But there is this Law for them to walk by too, that is, <hi>Si mulier nobilis nupserit ignobili, desinit esse nobilis;</hi> that is, If a Noble-woman marry with an ignoble, her nobility is extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; for she is under the power of her husband, and ought not to be in a condition above him: For example whereof, a case is cited of one <hi>Ralph Hayward</hi> Esquire, and the Lady <hi>Anne</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dyer. 79.</note> 
                  <hi>Powes,</hi> widow of the Lord <hi>Powes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I am of opinion, that (being onely an acception in Court by the Adversary of the Party) this is not to be understood, but in case the person such a Noble:woman shall marry, be no Gentleman, and that she hath received the Honor she enjoyed before, from the right of a former husband, and not by descent of Ancestors; for the words of Judge <note place="margin">Coke <hi>par.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Coke</hi> run thus: <hi>Si mulier nobilis nupserit igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili, desinit esse nobilis; &amp; eodem modo, quo quidem constituitur, dissolvitur:</hi> That is, If a Noble-woman shall marry an ignoble husband, she ceases to be Noble, and in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner her honor was constituted it is dissolved.</p>
               <p>So as by the Laws of the Nation, an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse forfeiteth her Dower, so also her honor of Nobility, if she commit adultery, either as a wife or widow; or else having received honor from her deceased husband, and shall so put him out of her mind, as to subject her self to


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:121170:52"/>
another, by which act she wipeth both the name and memory of the former from her, she hath the sentence of forfeiture against her. So Sir <hi>John Fern,</hi> in his <hi>Glory of Generosity, fol.</hi> 62. Yet the Law is thus curious in preserving the memory of Vertue in the honor of its reward, that if a woman of noble blood do marry a Churl or Clown, and have issue by him, she being an heir, that issue shall have liberty of bearing her Coat-Armor. But Sir <hi>John Fern</hi> says, onely for life, and that on a Lozenge Shield, (which is the feminine bearing) with the difference of a Cinque-foile.</p>
               <p>One note more I think proper in this place, which is, If a <hi>French, Spanish,</hi> or <hi>German</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be married to any Peer of this Realm, or other Gentleman, and be not denizoned; by <note place="margin">32 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 35. in the case of <hi>Gilb. Humfrevill</hi>
                  </note> the Laws of the Nation, she cannot claim the priviledges or titles of her husband, nor have Dower or Joynter from him.</p>
               <p>And thus much I think sufficient in this place as to the honor of Women; and if I have said too little, I wish I could have said more; if too much, I beg their pardons, but refer my self to the Law.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I should proceed to the display of Armory, by which the infinite number of persons are distinguisht, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable variety of different Ensignes, that do illustrate and appropriate their dignity and honor: But, by the way, I have stumbled on another Theam, which though it be not

so much concerned in honor, yet the Kingdom is much concerned in it, as a Power; and though I need not say much, yet I cannot passe by it and say nothing.</p>

they signed Indentures to be true and faithfull to their King and Country, and the service thereof, upon a penalty, even to the last long Parliament of eternall infamy.</p>
               <p>And in the third, of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was enacted in full Parliament, for the safety of the Queen's Majesty, her Heirs, and Successors, and the dignity of the Imperiall Crown of <hi>England,</hi> for the avoiding both of such hurts, perills, dishonor, and inconveniencies, as have before time befallen; that not only all persons should take the Oath of Supremacy, upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers penalties in that Act specified; But also every Knight, Citizen, and Burgesse of the Parliament, should take the said Oath before he entred into the said House, or had any voyce there; else he should be deemed no Knight, Citizen, or Burgesse for that Parliament, nor have any voyce; but shall be to all intents, constructions, and purposes, as if he had never been Returned, nor Elected for that Parliament, and shall suffer all pains, and penalties, as if he had presumed to sit in the same without Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Return, or Authority. And by King <hi>James,</hi> the Oath of Allegiance was added. Yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this limitation upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, Parliaments in <hi>England</hi> were ever esteemed, since <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the greatest liberty of the Subject, none else indeed being dreamt of.</p>
               <p>And as it is as great a flower of the Crown to summon Parliaments, as <hi>foedera, &amp; bellum</hi>


                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:121170:56"/>

He being then essentially King, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plowd.</hi> 221. 6.</note> without any Ceremony or Act, <hi>ex post facto;</hi> and Coronation, but a Royall Ornament.</p>
               <p>So the priviledges of Parliament, and of the Common-wealth by Parliament, are as great: for though we thus see the great Prerogative of a King, yet many things there are, which a King in his own Kingdome cannot do without a Parliament by the Laws, by which he hath <note place="margin">Bract. ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio libri.</note> bound himself; as the making any man heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or the altering the Common Law, or Customs of the Realm, though by his absolute <note place="margin">Brookes prerog. <hi>13.</hi> c. <hi>73.</hi> &amp; Stamff <hi>72.</hi>
                  </note> authority, he may commit any man to Prison, during his pleasure.</p>
               <p>Therefore, every Parliament-man, during the time of the Parliament, is priviledged from <note place="margin">Dyer <hi>60.</hi> Cromptons <hi>Courts.</hi> fol. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> all disturbance of arrest for debt, or the like, and the servants of any Parliament man, as much as the Kings are.</p>
               <p>And to this Parliament, for the further se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the good of the Common-wealth, were ever admitted certain Judges of the Land, (though they had no Vote, which sate on Woolsacks) that as the Clergy in Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:121170:57"/>
so the Judges of the Law, in things of the Law, were to advise and determine, when any difficulty did arise. That what Laws should be Enacted, might be answerable to the Will of God, and not repugnable to the Customs of the Land.</p>
               <p>And in our latter times, all Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though made by the King, have this style; By the consent of Lords and Commons; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Civill Law, saith, <hi>Quod Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipi placuit, Legis habet vigorem,</hi> The will of the King, is the power of the Law.</p>

            <head>The Analysis of Armory.</head>
            <p>I Have, with as much brevity, as so copious a Theam would admit, run through all the distinctions of Honor. In the next place, I shall with as great a contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lay down the emblems of those distinctions, and atchievements due to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the reward of virtue, in the metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall rules of Armory. Bearing of Arms at this time, being the only externall distinction of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and qualities, amongst all civill Societies and Common-wealths.</p>
            <p>From whence we received this custom, is uncertain, if especially, we look to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of it into rule and form: As it is from imitation, Sir <hi>John Fern</hi> is of opinion, that we did borrow it from the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> meaning from their Hieroglyphicks.</p>
            <p>Others will have, that the first institution of these honorable differences, was amongst the <hi>Israelites;</hi> but however, it is not much material to this discourse, to be too inquisitive of the


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:121170:58"/>
originall in that kind, since succession of time hath converted it into another custom; which may be, for ought I know, in imitation of the <hi>Romans:</hi> who were accustomed upon triumphs or festivalls, to produce the Statues of their Ancestors, as the pedigree of their Generous race.</p>
            <p>Which Statues were not, (as some may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) erected from the voluntary phansie of the parties represented, as is the leaving our Pictures behind us when we dye, to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny; (so might every phlegmatick, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick do:) but they were such, as were, for some Heroick act, allowed as a publick reward of virtue, which was customary amongst them.</p>
            <p>And truly, although every good Subject ought to be alwayes prepared alike, to offer his body and mind unto the service of the Common-wealth, without hope or expectation of mercenary reward, honor, or glory; yet is honor a necessary perquisite to a Crown and Common-wealth, being in it self a true spur to generosity.</p>
            <p>Out of which respect, the <hi>Romans</hi> joyned the two Temples of Honor, and Virtue, in such a manner, that no man could enter into that of Honor, without, first passing through the other of Virtue.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Ferns</hi> opinion is, that the first that imployed these Ensignes in this nature, was <hi>Alexander the Great;</hi> so to distinguish those


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:121170:58"/>
that had done any memorable Acts, that they might urge an emulation in their fellow Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>It is said of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> and <hi>Othraydes,</hi> that being ready to dye, they wrote their glorious exployts upon their shields themselves; to give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </hi> believes, that <hi>Charls the Great</hi> was the first that put them into this methodicall order; which doubtlesse, could not be, if, as Sir <hi>John Fern</hi> saith also, that <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted an office of <hi>Feciales.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>However, it is a generall opinion amongst our most judicious Heralds, that the bearing of Arms, as a badge of honor amongst us, was not till about the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, although many coats have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of by Sir <hi>John Fern:</hi> But how authentick his Authority might have been to him, to cause his insertion; or his to others, I know, not; but I shall be bold to insert one, which may chance carry some weight with it, which I shall raise from a Noble Family in the


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:121170:59"/>
North; the family of the <hi>Hiltons,</hi> (whose an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, (not only by an ancient pedegree, which I have seen taken out of the Office; but by the Records of the <hi>Tower</hi>) doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the noblest descent that I know any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in <hi>England;</hi>) the pedegree is too large, to be inserted in this place, else I would do it; however shall extract some notes from it, that may signifie as much.</p>
            <p>The first, that I find recorded of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, was Sir <hi>William Hilton,</hi> Knight, who marrying the daughter of Sir <hi>John Grisly,</hi> Knight, (a Family long since I think extinct) had is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue <hi>Adam Hilton:</hi> Which <hi>Adam</hi> living in the time of King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> gave to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of <hi>Hartlepool,</hi> a Pix or Crucifix, which was in weight twenty five ounces of Silver, and caused his Armes to be engraven on it; Arg. two barres Azure, which are yet seen upon the Gate of <hi>Hilton</hi> Castle, in the Bishopr. of <hi>Dur.</hi> where they lived, with a <hi>Moses</hi> head for Creast; the Gate and the Chappel, (which is very stately for its structure and bignesse) are the only parts remaining of the ancient building. He gave unto the same Monastery, a Cope &amp; Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Stole; and the like gift unto the two Monasteries, of <hi>Whitby</hi> and <hi>Gisbrough,</hi> with fifty seven ounces of silver to make Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. They were five descents before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; and hath now the nine and twentieth descent surviving. In which line were twenty four Knights, eighteen whereof were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued succession.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:121170:59"/>
But I leave this nicety to more criticall judgments to determine the thing, having for authority custom sufficient to make it a law within it self, without the derivation of any originall institution. Former ages ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving esteemed the Laws of Heraldry with as great a veneration as any in the Nation; as indeed it ought still to be, and more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in these, and all such times as ours, the Court of Heraldry being not onely the Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Honor, but the best record of Families and Inheritances, (though the Gentry of this Land are too dull to know it) since Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor hath been hereditary, as it hath ever since the time of <hi>Lewis Le-grosse</hi> (according to the account of Sir <hi>John Fern</hi> and <hi>Guillim:</hi>) As by one instance I shall declare; If a man being an Orphan, and, by such times as ours have been, the Records of what Estate did rightly belong to him, and from his Ancestors, may be burnt, plundered, or otherwise embeselled, and by such spirits, as such times do plentifully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, have been obtruded from his right, and hath nothing to plead for it, this Office being the just Record of his Pedigree, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Evidence sufficient, though from many generations his misfortunes have descended: More particularly of the Office in another place.</p>
            <p>As for the progresse of Armory, I have pitcht upon the most methodicall course I could, disposing it into severall divisions


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:121170:60"/>
and to every division adding its varieties, as in the succeeding Scutcheons will appear; that I have crowded many severals into one Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon, is to contract the generall into lesser bulk.</p>
            <p>The form of placing the devices of Arms on Escutcheons, is from the antient Shields; and therefore called an Escutcheon from the word <hi>Scutum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are also called Coats of Arms from the custome of the Antients, embroidering their Devises on the Coats they wore over their Arms.</p>
            <p>For the form, or rules, for the shape of Shields, there can be none; for, any form that a Shield may be devised into, may be taken for the shape of an Escutcheon.</p>
            <p>And next, for the rules of Blazoning, there are not many, but every thing to be called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their denomination; excepting such as by antiquity have continued other names then our vulgar Language doth now give. And again, observing a method from their severall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures and positions in the Shield, which gives a severall tearm, and must be very carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; for the adding or diminishing the least punctilio, makes the Coat so much ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, that should another man own it, he could not be question'd for it.</p>
            <p>And although Sir <hi>John Fern</hi> gives this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: <hi>Blazonia est recitatio, vel commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio alicujus virtutis; &amp; quempiam, sub quibus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>

                  </gap> abunde, &amp; vere laudare, aut deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum dicere:</hi> Yet our latter times have prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed a rule of avoiding, in any case of Blazoning, as much as may be, multiplicity of words, especially such as are impertinent: This is also <note place="margin">Rules in Blazon.</note> called Martialling a Coat, though that is a word by some esteemed onely to be used when many Coats are disposed or quartered in one Shield.</p>
            <p>Iterations of words are also to be avoided; and in Blazoning a Coat, the Field must ever be first exprest, and then the Charge; and in that what possesseth the greatest part, or nearest the center of the Shield, first.</p>

But this is onely a fantastick humor of our Nation, and for my part I shall avoid it as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, being no where in the world used but here; and not here by any judicious He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald. That I insert it, it is to leave it to those humors that will make use of it.</p>
            <p>For the order, according to the antient rule I have first begun with Metalls, and Colours, to which I have adjoyned the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the parts of the Escutcheon; distinction of Families, Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, and crooked Lines; because from them the honorable Ordinaries receive a various form and nomination.</p>
            <p>Then I have set down in one Escutcheon all the Ordinaries, which are afterward in an order, (beginning with one particular) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in their varieties.</p>
            <p>Then all dead things in their order, living and verdent, according to their position and posture; also those that are composed of some kind of Celestiall things, as the Sun, Moon, and Stars; all kind of Martiall things, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick; or the most part of what is usually born in our <hi>English</hi> Armory.</p>
            <p>In the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Arms, there is by all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a different value; as first, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls are allowed a precedency to Colours; so also is there by some understood to be more of worth in one Colour then another: Yet, for <note place="margin">Colours.</note> my part, I am of opinion, that it is so little, as not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the taking notice of; onely for other mens opinions sake, I will touch at it.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:121170:61"/>
First, of the Metals; Every judgment will be ready without any argument to give Gold the preheminence.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>As for the colours; I think they are thus to be esteemed in point of priority, Sables, Gules, Azure, Verd, Purpure; and some do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Tenne, but it being a bastard colour, is exempted, especially amongst <hi>English</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, onely reserved for abatement of honor, except in one or two examples of things.</p>
            <p>Thus I have placed the colours, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rules of some, as <hi>Guillim</hi> placeth yellow in the third place, &amp; green in the fourth.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:121170:62"/>
Sir <hi>John Fern</hi> allows Gules the third ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and placeth Sable in the fifth.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Guillim</hi> bringeth in also another colour, called Murrey or Sanguin, but I never saw it used in an English Coat; onely this and Tenne are appropriated to the abatements of honor, therefore to be set apart from the rest, I think, properly.</p>
            <p>The next in order is Furrs, which may be of one colour alone, or more than one, which Furrs are supposed to have been the doublings of Mantles.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>The first of these may seem to go all under


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:121170:62"/>
the name of Ermins, but they are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by various names, according to their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; as if as the first it be white powdred with black, it is Ermin; if black with white Ermines; if yellow with black as the Erminoys: if as the fourth black with yellow <hi>Pean:</hi> if white with black, and one red hair, Erminites. By which it is understood, how precise a man ought to be in the Blazon, or tricking a Coat, when so small a difference, as the colour of one hair, shall make a Coat another thing.</p>
            <p>The next is called Vayre or Verry, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Argent and Azure, is termed Vaire onely; but if any other colours, then must it be blazoned Verry of such colours; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Ermin and Gules by the name of <hi>Gres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> of <hi>Darbyshire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next is Potent Counter-potent, by some Varry-Copy.</p>
            <p>The colours whereof must be Blazoned.</p>
            <p>The last is but of two Counters, if called Countercomponed; but if more, then checky.</p>
            <p>If any of which be in a Bordure, you must say, A Border purflew of such a furre; blazon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the furre and the colours.</p>
            <p>Now by the way, Mr. <hi>Guillim</hi> doth hint one rule in Blazon concerning the Field (which is the surface of the Shield) which ought to be well observed for propriety of speaking; which is not to say, He beareth a field Or, or Arg. &amp;c. but the field is Or, or Arg. &amp;c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> else he beareth Or, or Arg. Gules, or the like, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:121170:63"/>
These Furres are often born in Bordures also, which are in the next place to be treated of.</p>
            <p>And here in one Escutcheon have I placed the Bordures; and in the severall quarters the differences of brethren.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Of Bordures, if it be plain, you must say, A Bordure Gules, or the like.</p>
            <p>If it be charged with Beasts, then it is bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoned, A Bordure Enurney of such Beasts; if of Birds, Enaluran of such Birds; if of Flowers, Verdoy; if of dead things, Entoyre, as of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanti, Mullets, or the like.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:121170:63"/>
The plain or simple Bordures have also their varieties, according to all their crooked lines. Which I shall shew shortly after.</p>
            <p>For the charged Bordures, here is exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nine distinct.</p>
            <p>In the first is a Bordure counter-compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Or and Gules; the second, a Bordure Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flew of Vayre, the third, quarterly composed of Ermin and Checky, Or, and Azure; the fourth, Gobbonated, Or, and Sables; the fifth, Sables Entoyre of eight Bezants; the sixth, Or, a Bordure Gules, charged with three Bendlets Sables; the seventh, Azure, Enaleuron of eight Martlets Or; the eighth, quarterly, the first Gules Enurney of three Lyoncels passant guardant, Or, the second Azure Verdoy of as many Flowerdelis: the third as the second, the fourth as the first: which, with a Field Argent, was the Coat-Armor of <hi>Henry Courtney</hi> Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> Marquesse of <hi>Exon.</hi> This may be blazoned short, by <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> The ninth is a Bordure Gules, Diapred, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyre, Enurney, Enaleuron, and Verdoy.</p>
            <p>This kind of Bordure may be of any two or other set number of these also.</p>
            <p>Now to the intent that Coat-Armor might descend to the Posterity with safety, and free from dissention of strife, Distinctions were invented, which I have here set down, to the number Nine.</p>
            <p>By which differences the Bearer is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of what degree or line of Consanguinity


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:121170:64"/>
he is; if he be of the second, third, or fourth House, and what brother of that House, by charging his Coat with the difference apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining; and if a younger brother of a younger House, then by charging the difference of the House with difference of Line, of Fraternity: There being so much care taken for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the honor of the entire Coats, that the eldest son of the first House during the life of his father (so of the rest) cannot bear it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his distinction, and, for this reason, hath <note place="margin">Segar, Fern, Guillim.</note> the Nephew of the first (the father being dead) been always preferred before the Uncle of the second, &amp;c. and taketh place before him.</p>
            <p>By the way also, we are to take notice, that if all the brethren die without issue, and leave sisters behind, as they are co-inheritors of the Lands and Estare, so shall they be of the Coat-Armor also, without any distinction at all, to either of them; because by them the name of the House cannot be preserved, they being all reckoned but as one Heir.</p>
            <p>Again, if they be not heirs, they are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the bearing of the Coat-Armor; for, saith Sir <hi>John Fern, Arma non transeunt ad agnatos &amp; affines.</hi> Yet their husbands are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to adjoyn the Arms of their wives fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in the sinister side of their Escutcheons, with their own; but if they have none of their own, then not at all.</p>
            <p>Now there is none of those signs, but are


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:121170:64"/>
sometimes born in Arms, as Charges of the Coat; but when they are distinctions, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily known by their singularity, either of place, position, or diminutive proportion.</p>
            <p>There is a care to be observed concerning the parts of the Escutcheon, as to the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of location for all charges, which are here marked thus,

            <p>Of these lines, the two first differ onely in this, that the points of the ingrailed line are turned into the field, and the other contrary into the ordinary, that those lines do make.

            <p>But there is another stricter punishment also for Treason, as Sir <hi>John Fern,</hi> Sir <hi>William Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> and the Civil Laws relate, which is, that though he have many sons then living, his Arms are for ever taken away, unlesse by some extraordinary service his successors do regain the honour of them, and wipe away the stain; for, <hi>Eorum memoria destrui debet,</hi> says the Law.</p>
            <p>And in the same manner are those other stains of abatement so rivetted to their Shield; when once by the Soveraign authority placed there, that neither the immediate possessors, nor succeeding owners, with their greatest force, or the all-corroding teeth of time are able to tear it away; but by vertuous demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to ingratiate the same hand, that put it on, to wipe it off.</p>
            <p>Pitty it is those Rules have not been exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed in our latter Ages; such a severity would doubtlesse be a means to affrighten ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that are enclined to these abominable enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, to apply themselves ingenuously to a gentle obedience, and plausible demeanor:

            <p>And for the first (as in my estimation very reasonably) the most honorable, I begin with the Crosse, and its various kinds of bearings, being more numerous by much than any of the other Ordinaries.

This piercing a Crosse, is alwayes known from a charge on it, by the colour of it; for if it be the same with the Field, then it is supposed the appearance of the field through it; and is sometimes square, sometimes round, and sometimes Lozenge-ways; but if it be not the colour of the Field, then it is a Charge, and receives another Blazon, as hereafter will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>

            <p>The last is Gyrony of twelve <hi>Argent</hi> and <hi>Sables,</hi> and so are they always to be blazoned, Gyrony of so many, if they be more then two. These, I must confesse, should properly


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:121170:79"/>
have been placed among the counter-changes. But my digression is excusable, since it is so near concerned, as the single Gyron belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly to that place; and then that the counter-changes are so near in a concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy, as the next discourse must bring them in; which is, to describe the partitions and counter-changes, according to the disposition of every Ordinary; and first of the partitions, as in the first next example.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>The first in this example is party <hi>per</hi> Crosse, <hi>Arg.</hi> and <hi>Gules,</hi> by Sir <hi>Henry Cock</hi> of <hi>Hertford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire;</hi>

and here is to be noted, that though the mettle be more honorable, yet if the colour possesse the dexter part, or chiefest part of the Field, that is first to be named.</p>
            <p>And, by the way, I must here observe, that some will have this to be blazoned quarterly; but certainly improperly, unlesse the quarters were charged; for why should this Ordinary above all the rest be denyed the priviledge of partition, which all have, but the chief, that in its propriety is formed but of one line?</p>
            <p>The second quarter bears party <hi>per</hi> pale, a bend counter-changed <hi>Argent</hi> and <hi>Gules,</hi> by Sir <hi>Geofry Chaucer.</hi>

            <p>The seventh party <hi>per</hi> pile reversed, <hi>Or, Gules,</hi> and <hi>Sables,</hi> which is very rare for the distinction of the field into three colours, as the last is also.</p>

they must be termed Lyoncels, that is, young-Lyons; because the spirit of a Lyon is full of Majesty, and admits no co-partnership in one Territory. But they make two exceptions to this generall rule, that is, When any Ordinary parts them; and, When it is the Coat of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; to which last I must concede, from his argument which is <hi>propter Regiae Maejestatis dignitatem.</hi> But for the former, it cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hold according to their own argument, without an absurd contradiction. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; Mr. <hi>Guillim</hi> blazons a Coat thus, A fesse Wavy betwixt three Lyons passant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of three is but one barred from the other. But I must be forc't to beg pardon, and to accuse him again, and by it lay down one exception more; in the Coat of <hi>Wickombe</hi> he blazons thus, Two Lyoncels rampant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant. When as in ordinary reason, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own argument too, being in a fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing posture, they deserve the name of Lyons.

               <p>These Helmets are sometimes called cask and timbers; by the <hi>French, Helenum;</hi> by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Cassidem;</hi> by the <hi>Greeks, Galeam,</hi> a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering for the head in time of war; and our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of bearing crests on them is from their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fancy of adorning their Helmets with some kind of monstrous Device: as the Head or mouth of a Lyon, the paws or horns of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain beasts; to appear more terrible. And that which we call Mantle, is not, as some doe ridiculously suppose, the Vestment which they usually had to wear over their atms in War; or, as some would have it, to secure their shield from weather; but from this originall, that Princes and chief Commanders used to adorn their Helmets (according to their qualities) with rich buckles, studs, and circlets of gold, garnished with rich and costly stones, and on

               <p>But in <hi>Germany</hi> and many other places where the laws of Honour and Armory are severely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setved, a mean Gentleman or new Atchiever is <note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>25.</hi>

               <p>The second, is the common fashion of Knights, which is a helmet standing direct forward with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The third is that Coronet of the Prince which is the same with the Kings, only the arches, mound, and crosse, wanting.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the Crownet of an Archduke,

which is the same with a Duke, the Arch only added.</p>
               <p>The fifth is a Crownet floral, only proper to a Duke.</p>
               <p>The sixth is the Crownet of a Marquesse, which differs thus, It is of leaves and points, the leaves or flowers above the points.</p>
               <p>The seventh is proper to an Earl, which hath points and flowers; but the points are above the flowers.</p>
               <p>The eighth is due to a Viscount, which is a Circulet or Coronet pearled, and neither flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers nor points.</p>
               <p>The last is the form of that Crown, which is found to be in fashion in the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror. Which I have inserted to shew the difference betwixt the Crown Imperial of <hi>England</hi> then, and now.</p>
               <p>As to the antiquity of these Crowns or Diadems, as notes of Regality: I finde not any where a just authority to assure me of their Origination: but, that there were Crowns, long before Tragedies were in use, is to me very evident; though Sir <hi>William Segar</hi> is of opinion, the use of them came from thence. <note place="margin">Hon. Mil. &amp; Civ. p. <hi>213.</hi>
                  </note> Yet, that the use of them in these parts of the World, might come from the giving of Crowns in Triumph, and Lawrels or Wreaths for Vertue, is very probable, which was a thing very frequent, and of very great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity among the <hi>Romans;</hi> and hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,

and been exercised in the Empire since the translation to <hi>Germany,</hi> and that with much Ceremony, as in the example of <hi>Joannes Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> his receiving the Laurel as <hi>Stratsburgh an.</hi> 1616. See Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> his Titles of Honor, where it is at large, <hi>fol.</hi> 402.</p>
               <p>Which custom hath since been in these parts, and indeed long before that time were Crowns given to Poets here; as, witnesse the example in St. <hi>Mary Overies</hi> Church, where one <hi>John Gower</hi> a Poet in <hi>Richard</hi> the seconds time hath a Statue crowned with Ivie mixed with Roses; but since it is more commonly used of Laurel. Though the Crown of Laurel or Bayes was first appropriated to him that triumphed for victory in the field. At which time, distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Crowns were observed according to the variety of merit. As <hi>Corona Muralis,</hi> this was due to him that was first seen upon the Wall of the Enemy. <hi>Corona Castrensis,</hi> for him that made a breach in the Castle of the Enemy; the first a Crown embattail'd, or made with battailment being of Gold, the other of Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; And then they had <hi>Corona Navalis,</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Fore-castles for service at Sea, made of Gold too.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Corona Ovalis</hi> of Myrtle; for victory, gotten with little hazard: <hi>Corona Obsidialis,</hi> which was made of grass for him that had preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an Army besiged. <hi>Corona Civica,</hi> for him that saved a Citizen from the Enemy, made of Oaken

boughs: <hi>Corona Olivaris</hi> of Olive leavs, for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in the Olympick games: And <hi>Corona Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulea,</hi> for young men that were found industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and studious in the exercises of vertues. But I find that amongst these rewards of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, the Crown made of Ivy, called <hi>Corona Hederalis</hi> was only appropriated to the Poets; and here we see the great encouragement given to Vertue, which was an age doubtlesse, when it was much exercised in all its species. When vertuous moderation received an estimation in the minds of young Nobility, before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And why should not any man blush to be seen reaching at it (that is only the recompence of vertue) till by some virtuous testimony he hath declared his desert?

               <p>Thus I have given a succinct account of all manner of Bearings.

AS to Knighthood in generall, enough hath been already discoursed in the first part of this Treatise. I come now, to speak of the severall Otders, and especially those that are called Soveraign: amongst which I must needs esteem that of the Garter, or St. <hi>George</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to be as Noble as any in the World; not from that epidemick humor of most Writers, because it is of my own Nation; but for the excellency of it self: especially, in that according to the Articles of its foundation, none are to be admitted to the Honor, but such as are Peers of the Realm.</p>
            <p>For the first occasion of the erecting these So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Orders of Knighthood, above the more common, was, that as all Honors were insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the reward and encouragement of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving persons, so these for persons of more eminence, or more excellent merit, to receive a character that might in a higher nature


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:121170:102"/>
than ordinary blazon their merit to the world.</p>
            <p>And that Order or fraternity must needs be esteemed of greatest honor, where the King shall submit himselfe to the badge of it.</p>
            <p>This Order of the Garter we find to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by <hi>Edward</hi> the third, after a return from the Warrs against the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> with eminent victories. The occasion Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Segar</hi> says was but slight; alluding as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to the story of the King's taking up the Countesse of <hi>Salisburies</hi> Garter; Which he wearing on his own leg, caused a jealousie in the Queen. And from thence received the mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, <hi>Hony soit qui mal y pens,</hi> Evill to him that evill imagines.</p>
            <p>But I am of opinion that this humor arose from the <hi>French</hi> stories only, who would be apt enough to endeavour an abatement of the honor of it, lest its glory should appear too illustrious in the eye of the World; and out-shine or eclipse their then blazing Star.</p>
            <p>And that we may a little examine the truth, let us observe the ridiculousnesse of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of these merry scandalizers. First they differ in their time, as shall appear anon; then concerning the Lady, they take notice of to make up the pretty Romance, the mistake is very great and plain; for in some places they say it was the Queen's Garter, and if so, what needed then the Motto? But most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they say, it was the Countesse of <hi>Salisburies';</hi>


               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:121170:102"/>
whom they name sometimes <hi>Alice,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Joan;</hi> when her name was <hi>Katherine,</hi> and Mistris, and after wife to the Black Prince <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heylyn. fol.</hi> 325. &amp; 326.</note> Son of the said King, as is well observed in <hi>Heylyn's</hi> History of St. <hi>George.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which, <hi>Froysart's</hi> error must appear very perspicuous, who was the first and most eminent Author of this mighty fable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mounsier Favin</hi> in his Theater of Honor, quotes <hi>Froysart,</hi> and <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> for the like account. But I am apt to collect another reason from Mr. <hi>Selden's</hi> discourse (an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that I think needs no Apology) and to think <hi>Edward</hi> the third, being to engage a field, <note place="margin">Seld c. <hi>5.</hi> fol. <hi>792.</hi>
               </note> gave St. <hi>George</hi> for the word, (long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Patron-Saint of <hi>England</hi>) in which battail he gained a great victory; which was about the year 1349. and at his return in the year one thousand three hundred and fifty, established thisOrder to the honor of St <hi>George,</hi> which agrees with the black Book of <hi>Windsor</hi> that Chronologizes it on the three and twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth day of <hi>April</hi> in the year one thousand three hundred and fifty, being the three and twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of that King's Reign.</p>
            <p>And I understand not, but that the addition of the Gartet might be after added to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of the Order: for the firstEnsign together with the Robes was the Crosse of Saint <hi>George,</hi> yet in use amongst them.</p>
            <p>And some do adde that the Garter was from a Martiall rise also, as that a leather-garter


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:121170:103"/>
upon the left leg was a mark given to some of the eminent Commanders with promise of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching it on those that performed honorably in the charge.</p>
            <p>For the account of the time according to other Authors, it is left disputable. Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> takes notice of some of the <hi>French</hi> Authors, that affirm it to be erected in <hi>Anno</hi> 1344. yet after his victories; as in the relations of the same <hi>Froysart,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Walsingam:</hi> And <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> (to whom <hi>Favin</hi> subscribes) <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fav. fol.</hi> 68. &amp; 70.</note> will have it in <hi>An.</hi> 1347. Yet in another place he sets it down in the year one thousand three hundred and forty four. <hi>Oportet mendacem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morem esse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And one other observation I collect from some of these Authors; that the Order was established before either of these passages; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Seminary to draw other Knights of the world into these parts; which caused the <hi>French</hi> King to do the like the same year of another Order by way of prevention; this is averred by some. Which is, I conceive by other circumstances, a mistake upon a Just or Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proclaimed by the said King <hi>Edward</hi> (about the year one thousand three hundred forty and four) in all places beyond the Seas, to be held at <hi>Windsor;</hi> about which time he caused to be built a very large round table for the entertaining of such Princes and Persons of great quality, as should repair thither; when the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was so bruised at


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:121170:103"/>
the Justing, that he dyed. At the news of which meeting; the <hi>French</hi> King sodainly after did the like, to obstruct the concourse of great soldiers and honorable Personages that this would have produced.</p>
            <p>The patron of this order is St. <hi>George;</hi> who suffered Martyrdome at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and was <note place="margin">Heylyn. Hist. de St. Geo. cap. <hi>1.</hi> fol. <hi>142.</hi>
               </note> buryed at <hi>Lydda</hi> in <hi>Capadocia</hi> according to Dr. <hi>Heylin:</hi> but Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> sayes, he suffered at <hi>Lydda,</hi> under <hi>Diocletian,</hi> about the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of Christ one hundred and ninty. Whose fame was so great in the world, that many Temples were built to his name, as that of <hi>Justinian</hi> in <hi>Armenia;</hi> and in <hi>Venice</hi> the chief Church for the <hi>Grecians; Jo. Eucaitensis</hi> built a Monastery <note place="margin">Cedton. pag. <hi>650.</hi>
               </note> to the honor of St. <hi>George</hi> in the time of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine.</hi> Into which the Emperors after were wont to make a solemn procession every Saint <hi>Georges</hi> day. In <hi>Carinthia,</hi> there is an Order of Knighthood of St. <hi>George,</hi> in very much esteem. And <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaks also of another <note place="margin">De vit.

               </note> Order of St. <hi>George</hi> among the <hi>Greeks</hi> whose Ensign is a red Crosse with this Motto <hi>Sub hec signo vinces,</hi> begun by <hi>Constantiue the Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When first it came into this Nation, is by the best Antiquaries left disputed; but that he hath been long honored as Patron-Protector of <hi>England,</hi> is proved by all, and by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> before the Conquest; The three and twentyeth day of <hi>April,</hi> being constantly celebrated to his memory.</p>
            <p>And it is no marvail (saith the same Author)


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:121170:104"/>
that so warlike a Nation should chuse to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the name of such a souldier Saint, known by the particular name of <hi>Tropheophorus,</hi> and of greater eminence in both the Eastern and Western Churches then any other Souldier-Saint.</p>
            <p>The Soveraign of this order is the King of <hi>England;</hi> the number of the Fellowship is twenty six, besides the Soveraign; of which when any of them dye, the place is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by another elected by the Soveraign, with the consent of the Fraternity, as it was antiently; chosen and estalled at <hi>Windsor:</hi> but since it is referred to the entire disposing of the King.</p>
            <p>They have many Articles confirmed, to which all that are enstalled subscribe; and have an oath to which they swear that, to their power, during the time they shall be fellows of the Order, they will defend the honor, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, rights and Lordships of the Soveraign, and that they will endeavour to preserve the honor of the said Order, and all the Statutes of it without fraud or covin. <hi>Quinam perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Officers of the Order are a Prelate, which is alwayes the Bishop of <hi>Winchester;</hi> a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor Register, a King of Arms called Garter; and an Usher called the Black Rod, added by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth.</p>
            <p>Their habit is a Cassock of Crimson Velvet, and a Mantle of Purple Velvet lined with


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:121170:104"/>
white Sarcenet, on the left shoulder whereof is an Escutcheon of S. <hi>George</hi> embroydered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Garter with the Motto: the Escutcheon is <hi>Argent,</hi> a plain Crosse <hi>Gules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Above all, about the neck they wear a collar of the Order weighing thirty ounces of Gold <hi>Troy</hi> weight, composed of Garters and Knots enamel'd, and with Roses red and white; and since the coming in of King <hi>James,</hi> there hath been an intermixture of Thistles. At this collar hangeth the Image of St. <hi>George</hi> on horseback, enriched with precious stones.</p>
            <p>And about the left leg they wear a Garter enamelled and enriched with gold, pearl, and stones of great value with the same Motto of <hi>Hony soit qui mal y pens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For their ordinary Ensign they wear a blew ribbon over their left shoulder; and another on their left leg; and a Star of silver embroy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the same side of their cloak with the Scutcheon of St. <hi>George</hi> in the Center of it. And sometimes at their Ribbon a <hi>George</hi> also, and then they wear it about their necks.</p>
            <p>Their feast is yearly at <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle on St. <hi>Georges</hi> day. In which place upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it was a Church erected with Dean and Prebends; as also thirteen poor aged Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, established to be maintained with sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends by the name of Knights of <hi>Windsor:</hi> who had appointed to them robes of cloath accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of the Order, which were to pray for the Order.</p>

               <head>Of the Knights of the Round Table in <hi>England.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is said by many writers, that the Order of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was inftituted in imitation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Round Table: but I can give no great assurance of it; only I believe it probable enough; the beginning of them both agreeing also in some kind of Analogy. This of the Round Table, (for so much as is remaining in History) appears to me to have been the most noble in the world, either before or since, for ought yet I can understand. And pity it were the memory of it should perish, as it is almost; being buried in the metamorphosis of ridiculous fables; and by that means only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with the shadowie reputation of a Romance, in the minds of many, and indeed most men.</p>
               <p>It was erected by King <hi>Arthur,</hi> who reigned in the year of our Redemption 490. and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Norway, Scotland,</hi> and so much of <hi>France</hi> that he was crowned King of <hi>Paris:</hi> as both ours and the <hi>French</hi> annals testifie. Of this King many fabulous things have been writ; but we may collect so much from the more serious, as may assute us that without doubt many noble and (beyond ordinary) heroick acts were


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:121170:105"/>
performed by this generous Prince. Which caused the society of this Order to shine with so much the more splendor than the ordinary stars of this sublunary world: insomuch that it is recorded in some Chronologies, that at one time summoning them to a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a place in <hi>Wales,</hi> called <hi>Carlion,</hi> or <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignion,</hi> there resorted to him ten Kings, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Earls, and many Barons, and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of great quality that were of the Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>This I have also in Sir <hi>William Segar;</hi> and in <note place="margin">Seg. f. <hi>155.</hi>
                  </note> a very antient Chronicle which I have seen my selfe in Manuscript in that Country; which was much the same with the relations I have since met with, of this Order.</p>
               <p>And that these Kings were not petty Kings must be understood, since there was at that time no Heptarchy, or Provincial Kings, but all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, much in the same nature as they have been in our ages.</p>
               <p>This King is generally reported by Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers (and some of them solid too) to be taken alive from the earth; or at least miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously disposed of, invisibly: but this is a riddle too great for me to unfold. Many of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> this fable I conjecture from an Epitaph that <hi>Merlin</hi> writ on him, <hi>Hic jacet Arturus, Rex quondam, Rex<expan>

                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:121170:106"/>
The Order or Fraternity however, was certainly in very great repute in the world, and being only a banquet of Honor could not but whet the emulations of all generous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; for none were admitted to it but such as had shewed their merit by some eminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit.</p>
               <p>Their place of convention was <hi>Winchester;</hi> where they had their Round Table, and at the Feast of Pentecost they alwayes met and feasted. So saith Sir <hi>William Segar,</hi> (in whose Orders of Knighthood the articles of this Order are set down): but others are of another opinion, and tell us that <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle was the most peculiar place, where a Round Table was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Heyly n-Hist. de St. Georg. fol. <hi>318.</hi>

               <p>THis Order as it hath been most famous in the world (though now extinct) I think ought to be preserved with an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble memory.

               </p>
               <p>Its first rise was from an accident of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">Vid. Aub. Maer. f. <hi>77. &amp; 78.</hi>

Which reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution being known was so approved of by the Patriarch, that he commanded accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them in the Temple neer the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre. And the King of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> appointed them all appertinencies for so religious an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize. From whence they received the name of <hi>Knights-Templars.</hi> And thus going on with much resolution and courage; many Christians came in to thrir assistance, and


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:121170:116"/>
many brave exploits were performed by them: Insomuch that in nine years time they had erected such a structure of honor, as set all the world at gaze, and establisht their Countrey in a happy peace. For a reward whereof, Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> at the suit of the Patriarchof <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> prescribed unto them a peculiar Order of life; and distinguished their order by wearing a white Garment, and Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a red Crosse; after which prosperity they elected a Head whom they called Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
               <p>Yet not long after this, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and a great part of the Countrey was lost for want of supply from other parts of Christendome. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they still made war upon the <hi>Turks</hi> for 120. years, and added new breath to the Trump of Fame, purchasing large revenues to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in most Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> being the exercise of love in all Christian Princes, and of emulation in every Heroick spirit: Insomuch that <hi>Vitriacus</hi> gives this character of them: they were, saith he, <hi>Leones in bello, agni man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueti</hi>

               <p>When indeed itwas most certain, that the crime for which they suffered was their vast wealth; and their fidelity to the Patriarch, whom they owned before the Pope: cause suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to set the one to solicite, and the other to grant, a monstrous doom, which they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under; for what will not pride and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice do?</p>
               <p>The Great Master himselfe and sixty others of the Order were commited to the mercy of fire in <hi>Paris</hi> at one time, and the rest persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if not executed, in most places; all of them dying without any acknowledgement of any one allegation, and with the same Christian and heroick spirits they had lived in,

               <p>But as such notorious evils are ever the Ush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of God's infinite judgements, it was not far off here: for the two Knights imployed in the accusation, were one hanged, and the other slain, in a short time after.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> did call such houses <hi>Diversoria,</hi> ordained to entertain strangers, which in our <hi>English</hi> are called <hi>Inns:</hi> and have been acknowledged with us in <hi>England,</hi> to be the residing houses of the Noblest Peers, <hi>viz. Oxford Inn, Warwick Inn, Ely Inn;</hi> and now called <hi>Oxford house, Warwick house,</hi> and <hi>Ely house:</hi> Somewhat according to the <hi>French,</hi> whose houses of Nobility (in <hi>Paris</hi>) are called <hi>Hostels,</hi> (in <hi>Latine Hospitium</hi>) in <hi>English, Inns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>London</hi> and thereabouts, there are fourteen, two <hi>Serjeants Innes,</hi> four <hi>Innes of Court,</hi> and eight <hi>Innes of Chancery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most antient Inne of Court, and wherein Serjeants of Law had their first residence, was sometimes over against Saint <hi>Andrews</hi>

            <p>And although the Innes of the Serjeants be somwhat antient for time, as also of modern age too: yet it must be granted, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of some others they must be respected but of a noval foundation. Yet forasmuch as they are receptacles and lodging places of the most reverend Judges, and grave Barons of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, and other Judge, in Office, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants at Law; they are by way of decency to be reckoned in the first rank.</p>
            <p>That Hostel or Inne which now is commonly called <hi>Serjeants Inne</hi> in Fleetstreet, was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a Messuage appertaining unto the Dean and Prebends of <hi>York.</hi> And afterwards pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by the Judges, and Serjeants at Law that lived in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, for a place of residence for them in Tearm time.</p>
            <p>And that other called <hi>Serjeants Inne</hi> in <hi>Chancery lane,</hi> was somtimes a Mesluage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto the Bishops of See of <hi>Ely;</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by Records.</p>

            <p>The said two Temples or the Templars Inne, are of any other of the Innes of Court the the most renowned and famous for antiquity: They were at the prime and in their original but one entire foundationand body.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:121170:132"/>
But in processe of time became divided; at first founded by a religious and devout Order of Souldiers, called <hi>Templarii</hi> that is, to say <hi>Templars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Knights within the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> purchased to themselves certain Lands in <hi>Fleetstreet,</hi> bordering upon the shore of the River Thames, and thereon (wit hin a short time) built a large Edifice, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a round Synagogue, like unto a Chappel or Temple, as it is now standing; and was by <hi>Heraclius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Jerusalem, Anno Dom.</hi> 1185. dedicated to the service of God; In which place these Templars by the space of one hundred years lived in great honor and opulency, enjoying large possessions, and those situate in the best places of the Realm; the like they had in other places; the Prelate of which Order, was ever a Baron of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after the suppression of these Knights Templars, their Colledge or Hostel came to the hands of <hi>Thomas Plantagenet</hi> Earl of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> who being attainted for Disloyalty and Treason, the same became invested to the Crown. And afterwards the Earls <hi>Hugo le Dispencer</hi> Earl of <hi>Chester</hi> obtained the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the same house; who for the like transgression was justly attained also, and then it came to <hi>Damare de Valence</hi> Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,</hi> the <hi>Lusignian</hi> family in <hi>France:</hi> who lodged therein but for a small season, so that


<pb n="239" facs="tcp:121170:132"/>
in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, the Sages and worthy professors of the Common Laws of this Realm obtained a long lease of this house for 10. <hi>l. per annum.</hi> A third part whereof, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the outward Temple, one Doctor <hi>Stapleton,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> in the dayes of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the second, procured for a residing Mansion to him and his successors, Bishops of that See; and it was called <hi>Exeter Inne:</hi> And so continued untill the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> her principal Secretary of State, and obtained the said third part cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Exeter</hi> house, to him, and his heirs, and did re-edifie the same. After whom the said house, or the third part of the said Templars house, came to <hi>Thomas</hi> late Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> and was by him conveyed to Sir <hi>Robert Dudley</hi> Knight, <hi>al. Sutton,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lieoester,</hi> who bequeathed the same to Sir <hi>Robert Dudley</hi> Knight, his Son; and lately came by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase to <hi>Robert Devoreux</hi> late Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> that dyed in the reign of the late Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth;</hi> and it is called to this day, <hi>Essex house.</hi>

            <p>And not to omit what is written touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the antiquity of the Coat of Arms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this house; it is warranted by the same, was, and yet is, to be seen purtraicted in an old Manuscript, written many years since, concerning the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Order, and which Manuscript now


<pb n="240" facs="tcp:121170:133"/>
is, or of late was in the custody of the Right Honorable Lord <hi>William Howard</hi> a lover of Nobility and honorable Arms.</p>
            <p>It is to be understood that before the Order of Knight Templars assumed to themselves the said Coat Armour they now wear, that they did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace as to them appropriate this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, <hi>A Horse galloping with two Men on his back.</hi>

            <p>The which Ensign was usually engraven on their Signet or Common Seal: It hath been conjectured that the significancy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was, that the Originall of this Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in poverty and want: So that when they were to undertake any expedition of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian service, they were enforced for want of ability, to ride two of them upon one horse: But it is more truly conceited that the same was rather an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

field, they would relieve him, and set him behinde one of them upon his own horse, and by that means conveigh him to some place of safety; where they should likewise take some speedy course for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Neither was this work of Chariy, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practised by the Christian Knights in those ages; but it was used by the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, and Pagans, who also usually were exercised in the same works of Charity, as may be observed, and read, out of the famous and renowned Poet <hi>Ariosto;</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that <hi>Reginaldo</hi> and <hi>Fernand,</hi> two Knights <hi>Charlemaine</hi> did fight together, and each of them was mortally wounded, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they agreed to adjourne the Combate till another day. And that, during the space of the Parly <hi>Reginaldo's</hi> Palfrey strayed away, and could not be found; whereupon <hi>Fer nand</hi> proffered <hi>Reginaldo</hi> a part of his horse to ride upon, and willed him to mount up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, with assurance he would convey him safe to the place he desired, which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginaldo</hi> accepted, and <hi>Fernand</hi> performed: This History is writ by <hi>Ariosto</hi> in the <hi>Italian</hi> language, and not unworthy observation to this intent.</p>

men, who were religiously bent, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged themselves by speciall vows to serve Christ as regular Cannons in Chastity, and Obedience; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their own proper will for ever.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The first of that Order was <hi>Hugo Paganus,</hi> and <hi>Godfrido de Sancto Hadomaro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their habit was prescribed by Pope <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> to be a white habit; and after, by order from Pope <hi>Eugenio,</hi> these Knights had their first habitation appointed them by <hi>Baldwin</hi> King of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> neer unto the holy Temple; there they were ever after saluted by the names of Knights Templars.</p>
            <p>This Order in processe of time did grow so universally great, that many great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and Townes of Christendome received their Order of the Knights Templars, as well in this our Nation, as in other parts, where they enjoyed fair revenewes and large possessions; for in <hi>England</hi> this University, called the Temple, was the feat and habitation of divers Knights of that Order. But it hath of late by the Princely donation of King <hi>James</hi> our late Soveraign been confirmed to the professors of the Common Law, under the great Seal of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>To the Inner House was also appropriated di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers learned Legists from time to time, which in number, continuance, and gifts of Nature, did exceed every other of the said Innes of Court: And therefore was anciently tearmed <hi>Inner Temple Boun Pleader.</hi> Which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to this very day; and it is withall much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed of, beautified, and graced with a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Garden plot, famous for its situation, neatnesse and nearnesse of the River.</p>
