         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the late Diſcovery at Hull.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince my laſt to you, It hath pleaſed the Almighty
God, out of his great mercy to us here, and the
Kingdome, to preſerve us from an eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and ruine plotted againſt us here, which I
thought fit to acquaint you with. I writ a word of it to the
Committee at <hi>Yorke,</hi> but ſince have made a more ample diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.
I have within my Company a Lieutenant, his name
is <hi>Foolks,</hi> ſonne in law to one Maſter <hi>Thomas Beckwith</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſant
at <hi>Beverly,</hi> a good Souldier but poore. This man, his
father in law, thought a fit Inſtrument to worke upon, and
to that end, ſent for him to come over to him. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
preſently acquaints me with it, and asked my leave and
advice therein; Proteſting, that both in regard of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a Souldier, and a Gentleman, nothing ſhould paſſe
but I ſhould know. He had formerly beene obliged to me,
and therefore I gave him leave to go, with directions to yeeld
to ſuch propoſitions as ſhould be made him; for otherwiſe
being in their power, I knew not how they might have uſed
him. At his returne he told me, that at his firſt comming,
after an unuſuall kinde welcome, that Maſter <hi>Beckwith</hi> broke
the matter to him, That if hee would doe ſervice, &amp;c. hee
ſhould be rewarded in a great meaſure, intimating to him
how unable I was to preferre him in any way of ſubſiſtance:
To be ſhort, He made a plaine contract with him, That if he
could betray a Port, he ſhould have five hundred pound in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45604:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hand, and two hundred and fifty pound <hi>per annum</hi> for his
life, this he willingly accepted: Then <hi>Beckwith</hi> diſcourſed
with him of the meanes how he could doe this; he told him,
that upon Thurſday night, the ſix and twenty day of <hi>May,</hi> he
had the guard at the North gate, and if Alarum were given
at another gate, called <hi>Heſſell</hi> Gate, he could then let them
in. This thus overnight concluded upon, next morning he
was brought into the preſence of one <hi>Triſt,</hi> he was a Papiſt,
and commanded Maſter <hi>Percies</hi> Troop of Horſe at the defeat
at <hi>Newbourne,</hi> and one Captaine <hi>Courtney,</hi> and ſix others;
ſome of which his father-in-law told him were Lords diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed:
Theſe promiſed him to make good his reward, but
they doubted, unleſſe ſome Captaine might likewiſe be aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it might miſſe of performance; and therefore propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to him to draw his Captain into the buſineſſe. <hi>Lowanger</hi>
a Dutch-man (a man truely of that faith, courage, and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that were I to manage an enterpriſe of the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that might be, I would not wiſh a better ſecond) they
propounded to him that hee ſhould have in reward 1000
pounds, 500 pounds for his life, and be made a Knight. You
ſee, Sir, whatever the performance would have beene, they
were not ſpare in promiſes. <hi>Trist</hi> told him he had a man of
his, whom under colour of carrying Armes as a Voluntiere,
he might imploy as he ſaw cauſe. <hi>Beckwith,</hi> it appears, ſome
time before, had an eye to have corrupted <hi>Lowanger,</hi> for he
had invited <hi>Lowanger</hi> to his houſe, and ſent him word hee
would beſtow a Gelding upon him, which he preſently then
acquainted me with, and told me he thought there was ſome
ill meant in it, and ſo would not goe: He hath exceedingly
laboured in the diſcovery of this, being in a great meaſure
ſenſible of his honour herein. Upon Tueſday we cauſed the
Lieutenant to write back to his father-in-law, that <hi>Lowanger</hi>
liked well of the buſineſſe, but deſired ſome better aſſurance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45604:3"/>
of his reward then <hi>Triſt</hi> and <hi>Courtneyes</hi> words, and ſent a boy
with the Letter; and that it might appeare to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Beckwith</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

be carried with more ſecrecy, the boy was cauſed to put the
Letter in his Shooe: the return was this Letter incloſed; the
originall (being well known to be his hand) I keep (to be ſent
when the Parliament ſhall command) leaſt it might miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as ſome other Letters of his, whereby his hand may be
knowne. I have <hi>Triſts</hi> man in hold, who confeſſeth he was
ſent hither by <hi>Triſt</hi> (under colour to carry Armes) to give
intelligence: and I finde he had endeavoured to ſend to <hi>York</hi>
divers of my Souldiers. This morning I received a Letter
from Maſter Maior of <hi>Beverley,</hi> the Copy of which I ſend
you, of divers aſſembled at Maſter <hi>Beckwiths</hi> houſe: Wee
had another, as I thinke, to ſurpriſe the Block-houſe, being
the ſtrong Fort of the Towne; but how that is, I have not
yet made a full diſcovery.</p>
            <p>I have ſent to the Maior of <hi>Beverley</hi> to ſearch Maſter <hi>Beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withs</hi>
houſe, being a Recuſant, and to tender them the Oath
of Allegiance and Supremacy, and to know their names. If
there had beene open warre, I could ſoone have told what to
have done in this buſineſſe: And truely, if I ſhould have let
the Plot gone on, and given them what they deſerved, I
thinke, being they came that way to have taken the Towne, I
might have juſtified it before God and man: But being loath
to be the firſt letter of bloud, I reſolved of another courſe;
which was, To advertiſe His Majeſtie of the Plot diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
leaſt ſome ſhould adviſe Him upon a deſigne, might
prove diſhonourable and dangerous to Him. This diſpatch
I ſent away laſt night. I ſhall trouble you no farther, but reſt,</p>
