            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The want whereof ſeems to have
had much Influence on the Evils complained

            <head>A
SERMON
Preached before the
GARRISON
IN
JERSEY.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Luke III. 14.</bibl>
               <q>And the Soldiers likewiſe demanded of Him,
ſaying, And what ſhall we do? And He ſaid
unto them, Do violence to no Man, neither
accuſe any falſly, but be content with your
Wages.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE are the Words of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi>
the Fore-runner of our Saviour, to thoſe <hi>Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
that came to be Baptized of Him. The
<hi>Jews</hi> were ſome time before become Tributary
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had GARRISONS over the whole
Country, and theſe <hi>Soldiers</hi> belonged to thoſe GARRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SONS.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52734:5"/>
It may be doubted whether theſe <hi>Soldiers</hi> were <hi>Romans,</hi>
or Natives liſted into the <hi>Roman</hi> Service: It ſeeming rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to ſuppoſe, that all that came to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm
had ſome Knowledge of the Jewiſh Religion, whereof
Baptiſm was a Rite. But among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and even
among their Military Men, there were not a few, who,
living among the <hi>Jews,</hi> had grown into a liking of their
Religion, and became Proſelytes to it: A famous Inſtance
whereof we have in <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> x. 1. who being a
<hi>Roman,</hi> and Captain of the GARRISON of <hi>Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi>
was one of theſe Proſelytes, and upon Preaching the
Goſpel, was the firſt Roman Convert that came over to
Chriſtianity. There is no neceſſity therefore to ſuppoſe
(as ſome have done) that theſe <hi>Soldiers,</hi> mentioned in the
Text, were <hi>Jews,</hi> bearing Arms under the <hi>Romans,</hi> but
we may with better reaſon believe they were <hi>Romans,</hi>
Proſelyted ('tis like) to the <hi>Jewiſh Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is this Argument to prove they were <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
That the Charge given them by <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> in
the Text, referrs to thoſe Violences and Depredations,
which GARRISON-<hi>Soldiers</hi> are too apt to commit
in Foreign Countries: Such I call thoſe differing from
their own in Scituation, Language, and the like, though
ſubject to the ſame Sovereign: Which Charge had been
leſs neceſſary to Jewiſh <hi>Soldiers,</hi> who in all reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be thought to have committed thoſe Diſorders among
their own Countrymen. <hi>And the Soldiers likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of Him, ſaying, And what ſhall we do? And he
ſaid unto them, Do violence to no Man, neither accuſe any
falſly, but be content with your Wages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52734:5"/>
In which Words I ſhall Conſider,</p>
            <p>1. The Perſons here called <hi>Soldiers,</hi> under which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
we are to underſtand Men engaged in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Life as their proper Calling, in contradiſtinction
to thoſe that bear Arms without making it their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Profeſſion. All that are taught the uſe of Warlike
Weapons, that they may defend their Country in caſe
of an Invaſion, may be called <hi>Soldiers,</hi> but not in a ſtrict
Notion. The <hi>Soldiers</hi> here named, were ſuch as fought
for Pay. For there is expreſs mention made of their
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Wages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Duty incumbent on ſuch, with regard, not to
the time when they are abroad in the Field fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Enemy (there are other Duties ſit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to them at that time<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 20</note> but when they are
diſperſed into GARRISONS, and Quartered upon
the Country, for the Safety and the Defence thereof;
For (as I have already Obſerved) the <hi>Soldiers</hi> in the
Text were <hi>Soldiers</hi> in GARRISON. They (ſaies <hi>the
Bapiſt</hi>) muſt <hi>do Violence to no Man,</hi> that is, not to their
Friends, thoſe among whom they Live, and whom they
are ſent to Protect; they muſt <hi>accuſe no Man falſly,</hi> but
they muſt <hi>be content with their Wages,</hi> or their Pay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I ſhall Conclude with a particular Application
to you of this GARRISON; wherein after I have
mentioned the Exorbitancies, and Oppreſſions, we the
Inhabitants of this Place did ſo lately groan under, I ſhall
take notice of the preſent caſe we enjoy, through the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Conduct of him<note n="b" place="margin">Lieut. Col. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Governour.</note> that hath now the chief
command amongſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52734:6"/>
1. I ſhall conſider the Perſons here called <hi>Soldiers,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which Denomination we are to underſtand Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in a Military Life, as their proper Calling, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction
to thoſe that bear Arms without making it
their particular Profeſſion. There is a neceſſity for this
Diſtinction. For 'tis not doubted but all Men have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Right to defend themſelves by Arms, againſt unjuſt
and unlawful Aggreſſors, and be <hi>Soldiers</hi> in that Sence;
but it hath been often Diſputed, whether Men may make
a Trade of Killing, and take up the Sword for Pay, which
is the true Notion of <hi>Soldiers.</hi> The Queſtion is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
in the Affirmative. For the <hi>Soldiers</hi> that came to
<hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm were Men that followed the Wars as their
ordinary Employment, and they took Pay for it; and
yet when they come, and enquire of him <hi>what they ſhall
do</hi> to be ſaved<note n="c" place="margin">

Indeed, there appeareth no where in the Goſpel any
deſign to Interfere in the various Callings, and Profeſſions
of Human Life, further than that may be neceſſary to
ſecure the great and indiſpenſible Duties of Piety, and
Moral Righteouſneſs. When our great Law giver came
to reform the World, he left it, as to its civil Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
juſt as he found it. Whatever Changes he made in
other Matters, he made none in that. This himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
by ſaying that <hi>his Kingdom was not of this World,</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">John 18. 36.</note> meaning, that his Buſineſs was not to meddle with
the Temporary Affairs of Men, otherwiſe than to oblige
all Perſons to live Juſtly, and Honeſtly, in their ſeveral
Profeſſions, and Callings. Therefore no Calling is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
under the Goſpel that hath not a Moral and an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal
Evil in it. But ſuch unlawful Callings there be (if
baſe and ſordid Occupations deſerve the Name) as of
Bawds, Panders, Wizzards and the like, who live by theſe
Crafts as others do by the moſt laudable Profeſſions. But
theſe are not Callings which Chriſtianity alloweth,
becauſe repugnant to thoſe Eternal Rules of Piety, and
Moral Honeſty, which Chriſtianity at no time diſpenſes
with.</p>
            <p>In the Ancient Church, when Men profeſſing any of
theſe unlawful Arts<note n="e" place="margin">Tertul. lib. de Idolol. cap. 5. D. Aug. lib. de Fide &amp; Oper.</note>, became Chriſtians, they were not
admitted to Baptiſm till they had Renounced them.
Thus we read <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 19. That <hi>many that had uſed cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Arts,</hi> that is, that had practiſed Magick, being
coverted by <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching, <hi>brought their Books, and

them for being Chriſtians; though I think ſome
of thoſe Callings were not ſo properly evil in themſelves,
as becauſe they had too near a Communication with the
Superſtitions of thoſe Times.</p>
            <p>But whatever cenſures the Church paſſed on ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
we do not find that when Men, whoſe proper
Character it was to bear Arms, embraced the Chriſtian
Religion, and deſired Baptiſm; I ſay, we do not find that
it was denied them, as it was to others, till they had
laid down their Swords, and engaged never any more to
return to that Employment. We do not read (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample)
that when <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion (of whom
mention hath been made before) and <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Acts 13. 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>
Proconſul of <hi>Cyprus</hi> (for that alſo was a Military Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand)
came over to the Faith, they were obliged to give
up their Commiſſions, before they could be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church. No, it appears they continued in their
Employment after their Baptiſm. Therefore in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical
Conſtitutions</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Lib. 8. cap. 32.</note> 'tis expreſly ordained, That, <hi>when
a Soldier ſhall deſire Baptiſm, he ſhall be taught to abſtain
from Violence, to accuſe no Man falſly, but to be content
with his Wages; which if he promiſes, he ſhall be admitted:</hi>
That is, he ſhall be Baptized, without being obliged to

abjure the Wars. He may be a Chriſtian, and a <hi>Soldier</hi>

given by <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> to thoſe <hi>Soldiers</hi> that came to
be Baptized of him. That was all that was to be put to
him, at that time, in reference to his Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>And accordingly how many of thoſe Ancient Chriſtians
went on to addict themſelves to Arms, and retained their
firſt Profeſſion after their Baptiſm, is evident from the
Writers of that Age. Even in thoſe earlier Days, and

with greater Liberty Indulge his Avarice, or his Luſts,
poſtpones all other Conſiderations to theſe, and provided
theſe be Expleted, cares not how much God be diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the King ill ſerv'd, and the Country oppreſſed. It is
Religion that makes one of that Profeſſion Peaceable, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52734:10"/>
Obedient to thoſe that have Command over him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Irreligion takes off from Men all Senſe of Duty, and
has a Natural Tendency to make them Mutinous and Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous:
Or if he be called to Act in a higher Capacity, and
has himſelf a Command over others, Religion will teach
him to uſe them gently and kindly, not expoſing them
to evident Peril without evident Neceſſity, pitying their
Wounds, and reſenting their Wants; whereas Irreligion
is the Mother of Tyranny and Cruelty, and he that has
loſt all Sentiments of Piety, and true Goodneſs, will be
the firſt to Rob and Prey upon his own Men. It is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
that makes one of that Profeſſion bear up with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Patience and Conſtancy, under all the Toils and
Difficulties of War, by Training him up in the Practice
and Exerciſe of Sobriety, Temperance, and other Severe
and Manly Vertues; whereas Luxury, and Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Soften and Emaſculate both the Body and the Mind;
and a Man diſſolv'd in Eaſe and Pleaſure, will never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
Fatigues and Wants, like him, who has inured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to Hardſhips, by Voluntary Auſterities, and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
It is Religion that makes one of that Profeſſion ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on the moſt hazardous Undertaking, and ruſh into a
Battle, with an undaunted Courage and Reſolution, becauſe
that being Arm'd with his own Innocence, and ſecure of the
Love and Favour of God, he knows that if he falls, while
his Body is laid in the Bed of Honour, his Immortal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
will be receiv'd among the Souls of all thoſe Ancient
<hi>Heroes,</hi> and Worthies, who in their ſeveral Ages have
ſought the Battels of God, and are now with him in the
Manſions of Peace: Whereas the leaſt appearance of Danger
muſt needs ſtrike Terror and Amazement into a Wretch,
who having a deep load of Guilt to account for to God,
and uncertain whether the firſt Shot from the Enemy may
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52734:10"/>
not be a Miniſter of the Divine Vengeance ſent to diſpatch
him, muſt be the moſt deſperate Creature living if this
does not make him grow Pale and Tremble, and does not
prompt him to manage a life, which gone, he knows he
is loſt and undone for ever.</p>
            <p>And now therefore who cannot but wiſh that all of
that Profeſſion would ſeriouſly apply themſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
truly Religious and Good? Whereby they would not
only prove Brave and Excellent Men, admirably uſeful to
all the ends and purpoſes of War; but would alſo take off
the Stain and Reproach thrown upon the Profeſſion it ſelf,
as if none but Men of Flagitious and Profligate manners,
were now fit to make <hi>Soldiers;</hi> and CASTLES and
Armies were only Sanctuaries for Thieves and Murderers.
In ſhort, it is an Honourable, Noble, and Lawful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
but it is little beholden to thoſe, who, by their ill
Lives, have foully Blemiſh'd the Ancient Glory and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of it.</p>
            <p>And thus I have conſider'd the Perſons in my Text cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Soldiers,</hi> under which Denomination, I ſaid, we were
to underſtand Men engag'd in a Military Life as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Calling; in contradiſtinction to thoſe that bear Arms
without making it their particular Profeſſion. I come
now to conſider,</p>
            <p>2. The Duty incumbent on ſuch; with regard, not to
the time when they are abroad in the Field, fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Enemy (there are peculiar Duties for that) but
when they are Diſpers'd into GARRISONS, and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
upon the Country, for the Safety and the Defence
thereof. For, (as it hath been obſerv'd) the <hi>Soldiers</hi>
in the Text were Soldiers in GARRISON. They
(ſaies the Baptiſt) muſt <hi>do violence to no Man,</hi> that is, nor
to their Friends, thoſe among whom they live, and whom
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52734:11"/>
they are ſent to Protect; they muſt <hi>accuſe no Man falſly,</hi>
but they muſt <hi>be content with their Wages,</hi> or their Pay.</p>
            <p>Were we here to enquire into all the Duties and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
of Military Men, it would carry us farther than
the time would admit: But this Reſtriction in the Text
to thoſe in GARRISON, will contract the Diſcourſe
into a leſs compaſs.</p>
            <p>The chief uſe of GARRISONS inany Kingdom or
State, is to ſecure its Frontiers againſt the attempts of ſuch
potent Neighbours as are round about it: And the more
potent thoſe Neighbours are, the greater care ought to be
taken of thoſe GARRISONS that lie towards them.</p>
            <p>Not long before that <hi>John</hi> began to Preach and to Baptize,
the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi> (in whoſe time both he and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

Judea</hi> (that Glorious Scene of almoſt all the great

               </note> which much reſembl'd
that of the <hi>Tartars</hi> at this Day. In a word, the <hi>Romans</hi>
had not a more Formidable Enemy, than that Warlike Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to encounter with in that Age.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the great deſign of thoſe GARRISONS
which the <hi>Romans</hi> had in <hi>Judea,</hi> and other Provinces of
the Eaſt, was to ſtrengthen their line againſt all impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
from the <hi>Parthians</hi> on that ſide: With whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they always had either certain War, or (which is
worſe) but an uncertain Peace, they took a particular care
of thoſe GARRISONS; which ſerved alſo to repreſs
any Emotions that might ariſe within the Provinces them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Now the <hi>Soldiers</hi> that came to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm,
belonged to thoſe GARRISONS which the <hi>Romans</hi>
had in <hi>Judea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not a more unhappy Situation than that of
Borderers, who lie betwixt two mighty States that are in
Hoſtility with each other. For as it expoſes them daily to
the Enemies Incurſions, and makes them ſleep with their
lives, as it were in their hands; ſo it draws upon them the
neceſſary trouble of Quarters and GARRISONS;
which tho compoſed of Troops that call themſelves Friends,
prove often ſo great an Oppreſſion by the Outrages they
commit, that there is little difference betwixt them and
the worſt of Enemies.</p>
            <p>This was the Caſe of the <hi>Jews;</hi> who being ſeated on
the utmoſt confines of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and
having a fierce Nation bordering upon them, were ſure
upon every Rupture, to be the firſt that felt the Miſeries
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52734:12"/>
and Calamities of the War; a Nation that had once pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into the very heart of their Country, forc'd admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
into their Capital City, and violated what they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
moſt Sacred amongſt them, even the Holy Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
But all that was not comparable to what they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
from the Roman GARRISONS. Not but that
they underſtood the neceſſity of them for their own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the guard of the Country; but the <hi>Soldiers</hi> of
thoſe GARRISONS demean'd themſelves ſo ill, Prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo unmercifully upon the poor <hi>Jews,</hi> that they could
hardly have met with worſe uſage even from the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
themſelves.</p>
            <p>This was not unknown to <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who, from
his Deſart and Solitude, could hear the cries of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
People; therefore, when the Fame of him had
drawn ſome of thoſe <hi>Soldiers,</hi> out of the next GARRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SONS
to hear him, he reſolv'd to take the opportunity
to remonſtrate this to them. And firſt, he prepares them
by an excellent Sermon of <hi>Repentance,</hi> which draws from
them this Pathetick Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that his Diſcourſe had wrought upon them, and had
produc'd in them a deſire to be reformed. To this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
he Anſwers (with reſpect to the Country) that they

                  <item>I. Do violence to no Man.</item>
                  <item>II. Accuſe no Man falſly.</item>

               <p>1. That they ſhould <hi>do Violence to no Man; Violence</hi> is an
extenſive Word, and may be us'd to imply any Injury or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52734:12"/>
Force, offered to a Man in his Body or Goods: But here I
take it in a more limited Sence, for an Aſſault made upon
his Perſon: And that's the <hi>Violence</hi> forbidden here.</p>
               <p>But is not <hi>Violence</hi> the Buſineſs of a <hi>Soldier?</hi> What does he
wear a Sword for, but to do Acts of <hi>Violence</hi> withal? Yes,
when a <hi>Soldier</hi> is ſent to fight againſt the Enemies of his
King, and Country, then let him, in God's Name, uſe his
Sword, and let him uſe it like a Man. Let him not put it
up while there are any that diſpute him the Victory. God
who allows his Calling, allows this in a juſt War. But out
of the Battel, I know no uſe that a <hi>Soldier</hi> has for his
Sword, more than another Man, unleſs to wear it for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and as the Badge and Cognizance of his Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> ſpoke here to <hi>Soldiers</hi> marching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Field, to fight the Enemy, he would not have ſaid
to them thus largely <hi>do Violence to no Man,</hi> ſince he was
not ignorant there could be no fighting without that. But
becauſe he knew thoſe to whom he ſpoke were <hi>Soldiers</hi> in
GARRISON, who, if they did <hi>Violence</hi> to any at that
time, it muſt be to Poor, Peaceable, Innocent People, their
Fellow Subjects, among whom they were Quartered, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

The Roman <hi>Soldiers</hi> in <hi>Judea</hi> are here charged by <hi>John

Aſperſions upon private Perſons, they criminated the

from each other (as all Nations and Countries in the

                  </note>; they were rarely

becauſe, how culpable ſoever ſome particular Perſons
may be, it is impoſſible but a very great many honeſt Men
ſuffer, and be involved in the Calumny. Not to ſay, that

               <p>But for <hi>Soldiers</hi> to do this, that is, to traduce Perſons

different kinds of Crowns, which were powerful Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives

ſuch Rewards as were purely Honorary, they had others
that were Pecuniary, and Lucrative, which were alſo

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which may indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
be rendered a reward in Money, or an Equivalent
in Neceſſary Proviſions<note n="xx" place="margin">Suidas in voce.</note>. And this word is not unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſed by <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> on this occaſion, becauſe the
Roman <hi>Soldiers</hi> were often wont to receive their Pay, or
part thereof, in a certain <hi>Dimenſum</hi> or quantity of Corn,
aſſigned them out of the common Stores or Granaries of
the Empire<note n="yy" place="margin">Just. Lipſ lib. 2. Elect.</note>, which was a good expedient to keep them
out of ſuch vicious courſes, as having ſoon conſumed their
Money, would put them afterwards on the neceſſity of
doing any ill things for their Subſiſtence.</p>
               <p>It ſeems the <hi>Soldiers</hi> in <hi>Judea</hi> were not <hi>content</hi> with this
Allowance, which way ſoever it was diſpens'd to them;
for that we cannot particularly know at this diſtance of
time. Some few years before there had been a Mutiny
among the <hi>Pannonian Legions</hi> about their Pay; alledging
(as <hi>Tacitus</hi>
                  <note n="zz" place="margin">Annal. lib. 1. <hi>§.</hi> 17. Denys in diem aſſibus corpus &amp; animam ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimari.</note> tells us) that <hi>their lives were held too cheap,
to be eſtimated only at ten Pence a day.</hi> It doth not appear
that the <hi>Soldiers</hi> in the Text complain'd of the ſmallneſs of
their Pay; but that which <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> charges them
with, is, the not being ſatisfi'd with ſo liberal a mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and Preying upon the Country as if they had no
Pay at all.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid that they wanted, when they did this;
which yet can hardly be ſuppoſed, conſidering the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Pay, as hath been ſhew'd. If they did, it could
proceed but from one of theſe two Cauſes; either <hi>firſt,</hi> from
the Neglect or Fraud of thoſe that were entruſted with the
Payment of them, who paid them not, or ſubſtracted part
of their Pay: or <hi>ſecondly,</hi> from their own laviſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident
way of living. 'Tis like they ſquandered away
in an Hour, and in one Debauch, what was intended, and
might have been enough to have kept them a Week. When
that was gone, they were left to ſhift as they could; and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52734:15"/>
then the Country muſt be ſure to ſuffer. A good Man will
<hi>be content</hi> even with little; becauſe allowing himſelf only
the Neceſſities of Nature, a very Moderate ſtipend will
ſuffice for theſe: But vice is a coſtly and chargeable thing,
and he that hath a large Stock of Luſts to provide for, and
is reſolved to deny none of them, needs a greater ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
than (for ought I know) hath ever been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Soldiers</hi> in the Nature of Pay. Such Men muſt of
neceſſity be a burden to any Country in the World that
they come into.</p>
               <p>Therefore theſe Words of <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> bidding the
<hi>Soldiers</hi> in the Text to <hi>be content with their Wages,</hi> muſt be
underſtood to contain a twofold Injunction. <hi>Firſt,</hi> to the
Officers to have an eſpecial care to ſee their <hi>Soldiers</hi> well
paid, and not ſuffer them to be cheated of that which was
the price of their Blood; to look that they were ſupply'd
with what was convenient, and by no means to let them
want. <hi>Soldiers,</hi> of all Men in the World muſt not want,
brave Men muſt not want. It dejects their Spirit, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
that noble Ardour from which ſpring all generous
Emotions; and I am much deceiv'd if any great matters
are to be expected from famiſhed and naked Men. This
care thoſe Ancient Captains renown'd in Hiſtory had of
their <hi>Soldiers</hi>
                  <note n="aaa" place="margin">Ael. Spartian de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidio Caſſio Jul. Capitolin. in Maximin.</note>; who have not diſdained to inſpect the
the Arms, Cloaths and other Accoutrements of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of them, to inter into their little Huts, examine their
Diet, ſee how they were Accommodated, have furniſh'd
them out of their own Stores, nay, have tore their very
Linen and Cloaths<note n="bbb" place="margin">Xiphilin. in vitâ Trajani.</note> to bind up their Wounds. And
this it was that reconciled them to their Love, more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
than the new Method that obtains now, which
is, firſt to Prey upon them, and then in recompenſe let
them Prey upon others without fear of Puniſhment. Not
only to ſee that they receiv'd their Pay regularly, but to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52734:15"/>
diſpenſe it them with Prudence, and by ſuch Proportions
as not to leave it in their Power to want at any time by
ill Management. When that was done, then not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to ruin the Country where they were in GAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RISON
by Plunder, and free Quarter, not to wink at
their Invaſion of any Man's Property; but to oblige them
to live on their Pay, and not on the Blood, and Tears,
and Oppreſſion of the People<note n="ccc" place="margin">

Secondly, to the <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</hi>
to ſtudy to lead Vertuous and Sober Lives, which
they would find to be an excellent way to live Cheap:
Sobriety being a Frugal and Parſimonious Vertue, whereas
if they gave themſelves up to that Beaſtly Vice of Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs
(the common Bane of Men of their Profeſſion)
it would bring on them this Inconvenience, among many
others, that to have one good or merry Day (as they
call'd it) in the Week, it would force them to ſtarve, or
ſteal all the reſt. But they were not to imagine that
Theft was a leſs Sin in them than in other Men. There
was not a particular Religion for <hi>Soldiers,</hi> but the ſame
common Law of God forbidding Wrong, and Injuſtice,
concerned them equally with all Men. Therefore they
were to <hi>be content with their Wages.</hi> All this, and much
more is implied in theſe Words. <hi>And the Soldiers likewiſe
demanded of him, ſaying, And what ſhall we do? And he
ſaid unto them, Do Violence to no Man, neither accuſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

that can be fall it, and if it be not an open Enemy, it
is at beſt but a falſe and an uneaſie Friend in ones Boſom.
This is a Truth which we have learn'd, not from Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
but from late and woful Experience. Of all the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52734:16"/>

               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:52734:17"/>
I muſt not Omit the ſtrongeſt Bond that is among Men, that of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
which ties us to you faſter yet than any thing I have mentioned.
We glory in nothing more, than in being part of your excellent
Church, <hi>the Church of England,</hi> ſo univerſally conform'd to amongſt
us, that there is not ſo much as one ſeparate Congregation of any
Sect whatſoever in this whole <hi>Iſland.</hi> Our <hi>Clergy</hi> bred (moſt of

Principles of Religion, and love to your Church and Nation, which

               <p>The <hi>Language</hi>
                  <note n="lll" place="margin">French.</note> ſeems to be the only thing that makes a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.
Could but this Difference be removed, there would be
none at all betwixt us and <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> in the ſtricteſt Sence. Indeed,
I have often admired that in the ſpace of ſix hundred years, and
more, that this <hi>Iſland</hi> has been in the Engliſh Poſſeſſion (for that's the
Date of the Conqueſt) the <hi>Engliſh Tongue</hi> has not prevailed in it.
To us it is really an infelicity, but to you I take it to be rather an
Honour. It ſhews the Grandeur and Amplitude of the Engliſh Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
better ſo, than if it had, or ſhould prevail; as the Scripture
notes it for an Inſtance of that mighty Empire which God gave to
<hi>Nebachadnezzar,</hi> that, <hi>Sundry People, Nations, and LANG<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AGES</hi>
                  <note n="mmm" place="margin">Dan. 3. 4.</note> were ſubject to it. 'Tis the peculiar Glory of out Kings, that
they have Subjects who Pray for the Preſervation of their Sacred
Perſons, the Proſperity of their Arms, and victory over their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in the very <hi>Tongue</hi> and Dialect of thoſe their Enemies.</p>
               <p>I grant we make but a ſmall Figure in the Map, and that may be
apt to create a contempt of us. We appear there but like a little
Spot compared to the reſt of their Majeſties Dominions. But is it
nothing that on this little ſpot are above fifteen thouſand Souls, <hi>all
Proteſtants</hi>
                  <note n="nnn" place="margin">There has not been a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> Native and Inhabitant, for this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years and more.</note>, who in humble Obedience to their Majeſties and
in the moſt dutifull Affection to their Government, yield to none
of their other Subjects?</p>
               <p>Sometimes we are told that we are a Burden and a Charge, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a Profit and an Advantage to you. But this is the voice of
Men who meaſure the Intereſts of Crowns and Kingdoms, by the
narrow Rules of private Intereſt. I pray God, you may never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the Importance of this Place, by the loſs of it.</p>
               <p>And now let the World Judge, how much we have been wrong'd,
when a rude and inſolent Soldiery, who were ſent to be a Safety
and a Protection to us, in this time of common danger, have broke
looſe upon us, to the utmoſt degree of Licentiouſneſs; and have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52734:18"/>
treated us not as Friends, and Men cemented to them by ſo many
cloſe and indiſſoluble Engagements, but as Strangers and Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and as tho' we had needed a GARRISON for a Yoke and
a Curb, rather than a help and a Succour to us. But bleſſed be God,
the Caſe is alter'd, we begin to breath after our Sufferings. Every
thing ſeems to have put on a new Face amongſt us; and one may
read in our Peoples looks how infinitely they are pleaſed to ſee the
command put into the hands of a <hi>Gentleman</hi> that knows how to uſe
it; and who by a juſt and neceſſary ſeverity, has reſcu'd us from
Oppreſſion and Miſery. Wherein he hath done ſo excellent a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
that whatever reward attends him from a Prince that knows
how to value Men, we who reap the benefit of it, muſt never forget
it; and 'tis the leaſt thing that we can do, to expreſs our ſenſe of
it in this publick way.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore expoſtulate no longer with you, but ſhall only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you, by every thing in the World that is deareſt to you; by
the memory of your glorious Anceſtors, who have tranſmitted us to
you as their old and undoubted Patrimony, and an earneſt of thoſe
juſt Pretenſions they have left you to purſue; by all your hopes of
extending one day the Engliſh Empire to its former Bounds on

to that of belonging to ſo Diſtracted a Nation; by the Sacred
Aſhes of our Ancient Kings, who have been ſo Indulgent to Us, and
