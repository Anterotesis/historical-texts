         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEloved, my soule having tasted how gracious the Lord was to me, in making known the riches of his free mercy, in acquitting mee from sin, through faith in the bloud of my Christ; when I lay in dolefull deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the time of my imprisonment, (for opposing that devised forme of Worship (which the Prelates had corrupted with their Popish innovations, by putting in, and leaving out, what they pleased) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Statute made in the third yeare of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, of happy memory) the first comfort that I received, for the assurance of the pardon of my sinne, and justification in the sight of God, was from reading this excellent Treatise of Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> in his <hi>Difference betwixt the Law and
<pb facs="tcp:119387:3"/>

            <head>Difference between the LAW and the GOSPEL: Taken out of the First Part of the book of Martyrs, written by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox.</hi> Title, between The true Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that then was, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that now is, Pag. 24.</head>
            <p>AS there is nothing more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and comfortable for troubled consciences, than to be well instructed in the difference betwixt the Law and the Gospel: So is the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> much to blame in this behalfe; because it confoundeth together those two, being in nature so divers and contrary one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: As, threatnings and promises, things temporall with things eternall, sorrowfull things with glad tidings, death with life, bondage with freedome, &amp;c. Teaching the people, that whatsoever the Law saith, the Gospel confirmeth; and whatsoever the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119387:4"/>
Gospel saith, the same is agreeable to the Law; and so make they no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Moses</hi> and Christ, save only that <hi>Moses</hi> (say they) was the giver of the old Law, Christ is the giver of the new, and a more perfect Law: And thus imagine they the Gospel to be nothing else but a new Law, given by Christ, binding to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises thereof the condition of our doings and deservings, no otherwise then unto the old Law; and so divide they the whole Law, after this distinction, into three parts, (to wit) the Law of Nature, the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Law of Christ: And as for the Gospel (say they) it is revealed for no other cause, but to shew to the world more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect precepts and counsels, than were in the old Law: to the fulfilling whereof, they attribute Justification; and so leave the poore conscience of men in perpetuall doubt, and induce other manifold errours; bringing the people into a false opinion of Christ, as though hee were not a remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law, but came as another <hi>Moses</hi> to give a new Law unto the world.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as they make no difference between the nature of the Law and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Gospel, confounding <hi>Moses</hi> and Christ together; so neither doe they distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish; or discerne, the time of the Law and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119387:4"/>
the time of the Gospel asunder. For, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bringeth in the Law to be a Schoolmaster, and limiteth him his time, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ,</hi> Gal. 3. 24, 25. and saith, that <hi>Christ is the end of the Law,</hi> Rom. 10. 4. that is, where the Law ceaseth, there Christ beginneth; and where Christ beginneth, there the Law endeth. They, contrariwise, make the Law to have no end, nor ceasing; but give to it immortall life, and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, equall with Christ: so that Christ, and the Law together, doe raigne over the soule and conscience of man. Which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. For, either Christ must give place, and the Law stand; or the Law (the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and malediction of the Law, I mean) must end, and Christ raign; for both these, Christ and the Law, Grace and Malediction, cannot raigne and governe together: But Christ the Sonne of God which once died, can die no more, but must raign for ever: Wherefore the Law with his strength, sting, and curse, must needs cease and have an end.</p>
            <p>And this is it that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of the triumph of Christ, saith, that <hi>hee ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up led away captivity captive.</hi> Ephes. 4.8. and hath set man at liberty (not at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to live as flesh lusteth, neither hath freed him from the use and exercise of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119387:5"/>
Law, but from the dominion and power of the Law;) so that <hi>now there is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that be in Christ Iesus, which walke not after the flesh,</hi> Rom. 8.1. And in another place S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, speaking of the same power and dominion of the Law, that Christ hath taken the obligation written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us in decrees, <hi>and hath nailed it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the crosse, triumphing openly over all, &amp;c.</hi> Col. 2.14, 15. So that as the Kingdome of Christ first began upon the crosse; even so upon the same crosse, and at the same time, the Kingdome of the Law expired, and the malediction of the Law was so crucified up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the crosse, that it shall never rise againe to have any power against them that be in Christ Jesus. For, like as if a woman be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from her first husband, being dead, and hath married another man, the first hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hath no more power over her; even so, wee now being espoused to Christ our second husband, are discharged utterly from our first husband the Law;<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 4.</note> and (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> in another place saith) <hi>are no more under the Law,</hi> (that is, under the dominion and malediction of the Law) <hi>but under grace</hi>; (that is, under perpetuall remission of sins, committed not onely before our baptisme, but as well also after baptisme, and during all our life long.) For therein properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119387:5"/>
the grace of God, in not imputing sin unto us, so often as the repenting sinner ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth up by faith, flyeth unto Christ, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth Gods mercy and remission pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in him; according to the testimony both of the Psalmist, <hi>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth no sin, &amp;c.</hi> Psal. 31. 2. and also of all the Prophets, which (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> saith) <hi>give record to him, that through his Name all that beleeve in him shall receive remission of their sinnes, &amp;c.</hi> Acts 10.43. Which being so, (as it cannot be denyed) then what need these private and extraordinary remissions to be brought into the Church, by eare confession, by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious deeds, and by Popes pardons? Or any other act of humiliations? (which words are inserted by the Writer.) For, if there be no condemnation but by the Law, and if the Law it selfe be captived, crucified, abolished, and departed, (which was the first husband) what condemnation can there be to them that be in Christ Jesus, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers second husband, or by whom shall it come? If there be no condemnation, but a free and generall deliverance for all men once gotten, by the victory of Christ, from the penalty of the Law, what needeth then any particular remission of sinnes, at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times bee sought for, at the Priests
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119387:6"/>
hands, or the Popes pardons?</p>
            <p>Hee that hath a generall pardon, needeth no particular: If remedy for sinne be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and perpetuall, once gotten for ever to all them that be in Christ Jesus, what need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any other remedy by auricular confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If it be not generall and perpetuall, how is it then true that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The Law is crucified, and condemnation abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> Or, how standeth Redemption per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall and generall, if remission of sinnes be not generall? For what is Redemption else, but remission of sinnes, or sins bought out? Or what else, to kill the Law, but to discharge us from condemnation for ever? Hee that delivereth his friend for a time out of his enemies hand, doth him a pleasure; but hee which killeth the enemy out of the way, giveth perpetuall safety: So if remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes, by Christ, were for some sins, and not for all, the Law then must needs live still; but now, the killing and crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law, importeth full remission of sinnes to be absolutely granted, and our safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be perpetuall.</p>

               </note> Albeit sinnes doe daily grow, whereby wee need daily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of God, to <hi>forgive us our trespasses, &amp;c.</hi> yet notwithstanding, the cause of our remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion standeth ever one and perpetuall; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the same to be repeated any more, nor any other cause to be sought for besides that alone.

            <p>Furthermore, as the cause is one, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perpetuall, which worketh remission of sinnes unto us; so is the promise of God ever one, once made and standeth perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, that offereth the same to the faith of the repenting sinner. And because the said promise of God is alwayes sure, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faile, which offereth remission to all that beleeve in Christ, being limited neither to time nor number, therefore we may boldly conclude, that at what time soever a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sinner beleeveth, and by faith applieth to himselfe the sacrifice of Christ, hee hath, by Gods own free promise, remission of his sinnes, whether they were done before or after Baptisme.</p>

            <p>Wee (saith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox</hi>) say, that what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting sinner soever beleeveth in Christ, hath already in himselfe (and needeth not to seeke to any Priest) perpetuall assurance of remission of sinnes; not for this time, or that time onely, but for ever and a day: for the promise saith not, He that beleeveth in Christ shall be pardoned this time, so he sinne no more; neither doth it say, the Law is stayed, or the sentence reprived; but saith plainly, that the Law, with her condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and sentence, herselfe is condemned and hanged up, and shall never rise again to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them that be in Christ Jesus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. and promiseth indeterminately, without limitation, remission of sinnes to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in his Name, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. And in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, the Scripture speaking abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119387:7"/>
saith, <hi>Sin shall not prevaile over you,</hi> and addeth the reason why, saying, <hi>because yee are not under the law, but under grace; Rom.</hi> 6. 14. adding this lesson withall, (as followeth in the same place) Not that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners should sinne more therefore, because they are under grace; but onely, that weak infirmity might be relieved, broken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences comforted, and repenting sinners holpen from desperation, to the praise of Gods glory; for God forgiveth not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners because they should sinne: So neither doth infirmity of falling diminish the grace of Christ, but doth rather illustrate the same, as it is written, <hi>My strength is made perfect in weaknesse,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. and again, <hi>Where sinne abounded, there super aboundeth also grace,</hi> Rom. 5. 20.</p>
            <p>In remission of sins therefore these foure things must concurre together: First, the cause that worketh it, (which is, the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christs body.) Secondly, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that offereth: Thirdly, Faith that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth: Fourthly, the repenting sinner that receiveth it. Thus farre M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox.</hi> The Writer addes an Objection.</p>
            <p>If faith onely justifie a poore sinner in the sight of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> why then is repentance added to faith in point of Justification, saying, The repenting sinner receiveth it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:119387:8"/>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note>If you demand of me, what it is that justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a soule in the sight of God? I answer, onely faith; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 22. but I adde repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to declare what is the nature of that faith which justifieth a soule; it is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting faith, working faith: and this faith worketh by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
            <p>And although sins doe daily grow, which daily provoke us to crave remission of our daily sinnes, yet, as touching the cause that worketh the pardon of our daily sinnes, it is the sacrifice of Christs body, once offered for all upon the crosse; and the means which apprehendeth the said cause unto us, is faith onely; and these remaine alwayes one and perpetuall: besides which, there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause or meanes to be sought of man. So that to them that be repenting sinners, and be in Christ Jesus, there is no Law to condemne them, though they have deserved condemnation; but they are under a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall kingdome, and a heaven full of grace and remission, to cover their sins, and not to impute their iniquities, through the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
            <p>Therefore, wicked and impious is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of them, First, which seek any other cause of remission of sins, save in the bloud of Christ our Saviour onely: 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. &amp; 10.4. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119387:8"/>
Secondly, which assigne any other meanes to apply the bloud-shedding of Christ unto us besides onely faith: <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God so loved the world, that hee gave his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that whosoever beleeveth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> Thirdly, and especially, which so limit and restraine the eternall priviledges of Christs passion, as though it served but only for sins done without and before faith, and that the rest, after baptisme committed, must be done away by confessions, pardons, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory deeds; or (as the writer addeth, but not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox</hi>) some qualifications of our owne. And all this ariseth, because the true nature of the Law and the Gospel is not knowne, nor the difference rightly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, between the times of the one and of the other, (as before hath been by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox</hi> largely discussed.)</p>
            <p>Neither againe doe they make any distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the malediction of the Law, and the true use of the Law; (thus far M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox</hi>; but the Writer inserteth these words) as it is enjoyned a beleever by his Law-giver King Jesus: <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>There is but one Law-giver,</hi> to the beleever, (for to such S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames</hi> wrote his Epistle) <hi>that is able to save and destroy, which is Iesus:</hi> who is become a beleevers Head and Husband;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119387:9"/>
who doth not onely shew a beleever what is his will, but giveth him strength to doe his will; and in case there be defects, as who transgresseth not, his bloud pardons all, and his love covers all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Therefore, whensoever they hear us speak of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> that whole rigid yoke, that bound us over to death and damnation for every trespasse and transgression done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, to bee to a beleever abolished, (though we hold it in force at this day with all his strength, sting, and curses, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever, (to wit) to the lawlesse and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murtherers of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and murtherers of mothers, for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slayers: For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9, 10.) they maliciously slander us, as though wee gave liberty to the flesh and carnall men, to live as they list: whereas we teach, that though Christ by his death hath freed us from the first husband, the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Yee are my brethren become dead to the Law</hi>; what Law was this, the Ceremoniall Law? no; for that was the remedy against the rigid yoke

of the Law, in case there were sinnes of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance committed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. from the 22. Verse to the 29.

               <hi>Quest.</hi> How are wee freed from this curse, the Morall Law bindeth us over to? <hi>Answ.</hi> By the body of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119387:10"/>
our cruell husband the Law, was not to live as flesh and nature lusteth; but that wee should be married to another, even to the Lord Jesus, that was raised againe from the dead, that he should be our Head, Lord, and Husband; who hath not taken away the equity and true use of the Law, as it is a rule of holinesse for all his justified ones to walke in, so it remaineth in force to this day, and shall for ever; as Christ testifieth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 21, 22. <hi>Yee have heard, that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill: But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgement, &amp;c.</hi> So that Christ sheweth, there are more wayes to breake the sixth commandement, then by laying violent hands upon thy brother. And so forward. Christ teacheth his justified ones the spirituality of the Law, from the 21. Verse to the latter end of the Chapter. As Christ now sheweth us what is his Law and will wee should walke in, so hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us in love to doe them; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>If yee love mee, keep my commandements.</hi> and in case there be defects, his bloud par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons all our trespasses, and his love covers all.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119387:10"/>
what to doe, and gave thee no strength to doe it (as thy second husband Christ Jesus doth,) and in case thou failest but in one title of thine obedience, in thought, word, or deed, thou must perish for ever?</p>
            <p>But by the Law cometh the knowledge of sinne;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I had not known lust to be sin, except the Law had said, Thou shalt not lust,</hi> Rom. 7.7. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Morall Law is not abrogated.</p>
            <p>First, As the Law is the rule of holinesse,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> to discover to justified man how to walke holily toward God and man, the equity of that Law remaineth; but the power (by which a beleever walketh according to that rule of holinesse) is Jesus Christ: <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Neverthelesse, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</hi> So that a beleever doth not now worke for life, and for heaven and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as hee did when hee was under the Law; but from life, (that is to say) from that principle of grace received; <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>As yee have received Iesus Christ the Lord, so walke in him: Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as yee have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.</hi> Hence <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:119387:11"/>Secondly, The rigidnesse of the yoke, that bindeth every observer of the Law under the curse, is taken away by Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. so that the power and penalty of the Law can bring his soule in bondage no more, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. seeing Christ hath set him free.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Law it selfe did not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>Paul</hi> his sinne; (for hee boastingly said, in his naturall condition, as hee was a Jew, borne of the stock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and circumcised the eighth day, and by the Law a Pharisee; and concerning zeale, persecuting the Church; and concerning the keeping of the Law, blamelesse; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6.) but by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ hee came to know himselfe a sinner; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>This is a faithfull saying, and worthy of all men to be received, That Iesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chiefe.</hi> So that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> never saw himselfe a sinner, till hee had seen Christ; and the more hee by grace saw the beauty and excellency of Christ, the more hee saw the corruption of his owne evill heart, burning in lust against the Law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. from the 14. to the 24. Verse: from which corruption, none could free him but a Christ alone; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore breaketh out into praises, <hi>I thanke my God through Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.25.</note> Thus though the Law
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119387:11"/>
be as a rule, to shew a man his evills com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against it, yet it is Christ must give thee eyes to see thy sinne and transgression thou hast done against it, as justified <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth; <hi>I had not known lust to be sinne, except the Law had said,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> Thou shalt not lust.</hi> Christ must give the light, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 17, 18. Christ sent <hi>Paul</hi> to the Gentiles, <hi>To open their blind eyes, and to turne them from darknesse to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth branch is taken out of the briefe recapitulation of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine delivered to the Gentiles, out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox,</hi> Tom. 1. pag. 19.</p>
            <p>To teach and informe us (to whom the benefits of Christs passion and victory doe appertaine) by what meanes the same is applied, and redoundeth unto us; which meanes is onely one, (that is) onely faith in Christ Jesus, and no other thing; which faith, it pleaseth Almighty God to accept for righteousnesse: and this righteousnesse it is which onely standeth before God, and none other, as wee are plainly taught by the Scriptures, and especially by the doctrine of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul:</hi> which righteousnesse, thus ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of faith in Christ, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth, The righteousnesse of God; where hee speaking of himselfe utterly refusing the other righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119387:12"/>
which is of the Law, that hee may be found in him, not having his owne righteousnesse, which is of the Law, but the righteousnesse of Christ, which is of faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. Again, the said Apostle writing of the Jewes, which sought for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but found it not; and also of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, which sought not for it, and yet found it, shewed the reason why, Because (saith hee) the one sought it as by workes, and by Law, and came not to it: Who not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the righteousnesse of God, and seeking to set up their owne righteousnesse, did not submit themselves to the righteousnesse which is of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 32. &amp; 10. 3. The other, which were Gentiles, and sought not for it, obtained righteousnesse, <hi>even that righteousnesse which is of faith,</hi> Rom. 9. 30. Also, in another place, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the same Epistle writing of this righteousnesse, which cometh of faith, calleth it the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of God, in these words, <hi>Whom God</hi> (saith hee) <hi>hath set forth to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, through faith in his bloud, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his righteousnesse for the remission of sinnes that are past through the forbearance of God: To declare, I say, at that time his righteousnesse; that hee might be just, and the justifier of him that beleeveth in Iesus. Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. By which righteousnesse, it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119387:12"/>
is evident that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of faith, which Almighty God now revealeth, and maketh manifest, by preaching of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Wilt thou see (gentle Reader) yet more plainly this righteousnesse of God, how it is taken in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles for the righteousnesse of faith, and therefore is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the righteousnesse of God; because it is imputed onely of God to faith, and not deserved of man? <hi>But now the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God without the Law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: Even the righteousnesse of God which is by faith of Iesus Christ unto all, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all them that beleeve; for there is no difference: For all have sinned, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 3. 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>Wherefore whosoever studieth to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God, and be found righteous in his sight, let him learne diligently, by the doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to make a difference and a separation, as farre as from heaven and earth, betweene these two; that is, between the righteousnesse of workes, and the righteousnesse of faith: and in any wise let him beware hee bring no other meanes for his justification, and remission of his sins, but onely faith, apprehending the body or person of Jesus Christ crucified. For as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119387:13"/>
there is no way into the house but by the doore, so there is no coming to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but by Christ alone, which is by faith in him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 6. And as the mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without bodily sustenance of bread and wine cannot but perish, so the spirituall part of man hath no other refreshing, but onely by faith in the body and bloud of Christ, whereby hee may be saved; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14, 16, 36. &amp; 6. 53, 54. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 43. &amp; 26. 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. Thus apostatized <hi>Adam,</hi> that had broken the Law by eating the forbidden fruit, and had the earth accursed for his sin, was saved by faith in the free-promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> that was by nature an Idolater, was saved by faith in a Gospel-promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. Thus <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> the great sinner, was saved by faith in a free-promise, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47. <hi>Daughter, be of good comfort, thy sinnes are forgiven thee: Thy faith hath saved thee, goe in peace.</hi> Verse 50. Thus <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Captaine of the Italian band, with them that beleeved in his house with him, were saved by faith; <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. &amp; 11. 17, 18. Yea, and thus the cruell Jailor (that beat the Apostles) and his houshold, were saved by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34.</p>
            <p>Thus thou maist see (gentle Reader) that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119387:13"/>
as the death of Jesus Christ on the tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. is the onely meritorious cause of salvation, so is faith the only instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall or maine cause that maketh the merits of Christ to us availeable; for as the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Christ on the accursed tree, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. serveth to the benefit of none but such as doe beleeve; so neither doth faith (as it is onely a bare quality or action in mans mind) it selfe justifie, unlesse it be directed to the body of Christ crucified, as to his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, of whom it receiveth all his vertue. And therefore these two must alwayes joyntly concurre together, Faith and Christ Jesus crucified: As for example, When the children of Israel were bid of <hi>Moses</hi> to look up to the brasen serpent, neither could the serpent have helped them, except they had looked up, nor yet their looking upward have profited them, unlesse they had directed their eye unto the said brasen serpent, as the onely object set up of God for the same purpose, for them to behold; so all poore sinners are commanded in the Gospel to look up to Jesus whom they have pierced, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. now a crucified Jesus cannot help them, except they looke up; nor yet their beleeving, or looking upward cannot profit them, unlesse they direct the eye of their faith unto the said crucified Jesus, as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119387:14"/>
the onely object, set up of Gods free grace for them to behold, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 14. Thus our faith, directed (by Gods own Spirit, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10.) to the body of Jesus crucified, is the onely meanes whereby Christs merits are applied to us, and we now justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; according to the doctrine of <hi>Paul,</hi> who in expresse words defining what this faith is, and how it justifieth, saith, <hi>If thou shalt confesse with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and shalt beleeve in thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</hi> Rom. 10. 9.</p>
            <p>Besides this, what action or quality soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is in man, either hope, charity, or any other kind of faith or beleeving, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so true, except it apprehend this object, (which is) the body of Christ the Sonne of God, that loved us, and gave himselfe for us, it serveth not to justification: And that is the cause why wee adde this particle [<hi>onely</hi>] to faith, and say, that Faith onely in Christ justifieth us; to exclude all other actions, qualities; (Thus farre M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox:</hi> the Writer addes,) qualifications, marks, signes, evidences of sanctification, as poverty of spirit, mourning for sinne, hungring and thirsting after Christ, love to the brethren, universall obedience, or gifts, or workes of beleevers, as repentance for sinne, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119387:14"/>
acts of humiliation, fasting, praying, weeping, mourning, or reformation, or deed of charity, from the cause of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               </note> &amp;c. because I will not make them causes of my justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? Markes, signes, and evidences of sanctification flow from faith, and not faith from them; they are the fruits (as I may so speake) of a justifying faith, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what kind of faith it is that justifieth; namely, repenting faith, working faith: <hi>They shall look upon him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourne over him, as one mourneth for an onely sonne, and shall be in bitternesse for him, as one that is in bitternesse for his first-borne,</hi> Zech. 12.10.

of God, unto justification of a poore sinner, or whereunto any promise of salvation is annexed, but onely this faith, looking up to this spirituall Brasen Serpent; that is, to the body of Christ Jesus for us crucified: <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. As for example,</p>
            <p>When the Turke saith, that hee beleeveth in one living God, that made heaven and earth; his beleefe therein is true, yet it justifieth him not; because it lacketh the right object, which is Christ Jesus cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>So when the Jew saith, that he beleeveth in one God, maker of heaven and earth; and beleeveth also the same God to be om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, mercifull, just, and true of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and that hee hath elected the seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> true it is that hee beleeveth; and yet all this serveth him not, because Jesus Christ crucified, the Sonne of God, is not joyned with all. And though the said Jew should be never so devout in his prayers, or charitable in his almes, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in keeping the Law, and beleeve never so stedfastly that hee is elect to be saved; yet hee is never the nearer to salvation for all this, so long as his faith is not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the head Corner-stone, which is the person and body of Jesus Christ, the true Saviour; seeing there is salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

in none other: <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12.</p>
            <p>After like sort it may be said of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, when hee saith that hee is baptized, and beleeveth in the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, three Persons and one God, and also confesseth that Jesus is the Sonne of God, which died for our sinnes, and rose againe for our righteousnesse, &amp;c. his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe therein is true, and indeed would save him, if hee did stay his salvation in this faith, and upon Christ his Saviour onely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the promise and grace of God, and goe no further: but that hee doth not; for neither doth hee admit Christ onely to be his perfect Saviour, without the help of Patrons, Deeds, Advocates and Mediatours, nor yet permitteth his faith in Christ onely to be the meanes of his justification; but setteth up other by-meanes, as hope, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Sacrifice of the Masse, confession, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, satisfaction, merits, and pardons, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing thereby to worke his justification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; contrary to the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. and to the Gospel of grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. Thus farre M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox.</hi> Now the Writer inserteth a few words.

content with a divided Christ: But, the true Spouse of Christ will have a whole Christ or none in point of Justification, or Intercession; for Christ will not give his glory to another: And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, that if wee bring circumcision to adde to Christ, in point of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (as without which hee were not a perfect Saviour) Christ profits nothing: <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2.</p>
            <p>Now to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox.</hi> And thus much of the true causes of our justification; after the doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> Concerning which causes, this distinction furthermore by the way is to be added, that as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the originall causes of our salvation, which be divers and sundry, some are externall, and without us; some are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, and within us. Of the externall causes, which are without us, the first and principall is, the mercy and grace of God: Of this followeth Predestination and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. 12. then Vocation, which is of free grace, nothing in the creature is the cause of it; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. The last, and next cause to this, is the death and bloud-shedding of Christ; whereby wee are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed: And all these be externall causes, because they are without us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:119387:17"/>Of internall causes that be in man, through the gift of God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.8. there is but one, and no more in Scripture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; that is, our faith in Christ; which is the gift of God in us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. Besides this, there is no gift of God given to man; vertue, worke, merit, nor any thing else, that is any part or cause of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but onely this gift of faith, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Christ Jesus. And this is the cause why wee hold, that faith onely justifieth; meaning, that amongst all the workes, deeds; actions, labours, and operations whatsoever man doth or can doe, there is nothing in man that worketh salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely his faith, given him of God, to beleeve in Christ Jesus his Sonne, that was crucified for him. Following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the trade of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> teaching, who in precise words so ascribeth Justification to Faith, that hee excludeth all other actions of man, and workes of the Law: and therefore, in the Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reasoning of the glory of justifying, asketh this question, How this glory is excluded? <hi>By what law? of workes? Nay; but by the law of faith: Therefore we conclude, that a man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith without the deeds of the law.</hi> Rom. 3.27, 28.

Now the Writer will insert a few words, in explanation of a Text of Scripture, in setting out the dignity of faith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. To the saving knowledge of the promise of life rendered to a beleever in Jesus Christ, there is required these six parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
            <p>The first is, the freenesse of grace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: It requireth nothing precedent in any man; no qualifications, preparations, dispositions whatsoever; no freedome from any sinne, in one kind or other; no antecedent sorrow or remorse for sinne; but that it is freely and willingly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Lord, to be embraced and beleeved by the most unworthiest of men, as by the worthiest of all.</p>
            <p>But is there no qualification in the soule precedent to faith?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>If there be any qualification in the soul precedent,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> or going before faith, then there may be something pleasing to God in the soule before faith received; But there is nothing pleasing unto God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith; the reason is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is impossible to please God.</hi> Therefore I conclude, there is no quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, preparation, disposition whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in the soule pleasing unto God before faith received; for, as for poverty of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119387:18"/>
and mourning for sinne,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> and hungring and thirsting after Christ and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,<note place="margin">Luk. 6.</note> these flow from faith; and they are the effects and fruits of that faith that justifieth.</p>
            <p>The second is, the fulnesse of this grace: which standeth chiefly in two things:
<list>
                  <item>1. In the extent of it to all sinnes; so that no sinnes whatsoever, or how many soever, or of what continuance soever, can make a man (in his naturall condition) uncapable of this pardon and forgivenesse of them there offered. As for the sinne against the holy Spirit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 31. that is a sinne against light, and grace received, as appeareth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6.</item>
                  <item>2. In the extent unto all persons: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, of what ranck or condition soever, or of what number soever; instance, if ten or an hundred, or ten thousand of the greatest and foulest sinners in the world accepting, (that is to say) beleeving the promise of life in Christ, shall be as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and certainly pardoned, as the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest number of the lightest offenders that ever were. These two things are in the note of the universality, <hi>Whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in him shall not perish.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The third is, the knowledge of the Gospel; which requireth the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119387:18"/>
of the way, and of the means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, and of the derivation of this grace to the world; and that is, in and by Jesus Christ, as for his sake onely.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, the incommunicablenesse of this pardoning and saving grace, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole or in part; in any other way, or by any other meanes whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, then by and through Christ alone. This third and fourth I conceive to bee expressed in these words [<hi>in him,</hi>] that is, In Christ Jesus; and in Christ Jesus so intirely, that hee joyneth nothing with him to trust on or confide in besides: <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2,3.</p>
            <p>The fifth is, that act or condition in the creature, (by which God doth actually instate him in the possession of this grace) which is, faith, or beleeving of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of life in Jesus Christ: In this word, [<hi>beleeveth.</hi>]</p>
            <p>The sixth is, the infinite benefit in this grace received by faith, or beleeving; that is, salvation: (clearly expressed in these words) <hi>shall not perish, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life.</hi> So much the Author or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inserteth.</p>
            <p>The last part of this Treatise, that the Author hath taken out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Foxes</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, is out of the Summary collections
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119387:19"/>
of the errours, heresies, absurdities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Popes doctrine; contrary to the rule of Gods word, and the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Tome 1. part. pag. 22.</p>
            <p>This errour and heresie of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though it seeme at the first sight, to the naturall reason of man, to be but of small importance; yet if it be earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, it is in very deed the most pernicious heresie that ever (almost) crept into the Church: upon which, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foundation, all, or the most part of all the errours, absurdities, and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of the Popes Church are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>For, this being once admitted, that a man is not justified by his faith in Christ alone, but other meanes (and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or evidences of sanctification) must be sought, by our owne working and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to apply the merits of Christs Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto us, then is there neither any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty left of our salvation, nor end in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up new meanes (and markes and signes) and merits of our owne devising, for the getting of the assurance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes. Neither hath there been any heresie, that hath either rebelled more presumptuously against the high Majesty of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119387:19"/>
God the Father, nor more perniciously hath injured the soule of the simple, than this doctrine.</p>

                  </note> that due debt, if it be proved by the Law duly deserved, it must be certaine; but if the Law shall prove it imperfect, or unsufficiently due, then it is not certaine, neither can there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing duly claimed.

in bloud, that the promise of pardon and forgivenesse of sinne may be sure to all that beleeve; <hi>For a mans Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament is of force after a man is dead, Heb.</hi> 9. 17. and sealed inwardly by the Spirit to the conscience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. and outwardly by the Sacrament of Baptisme, and the Lords Supper; which are to us that beleeve, as the rain-bow was to the old world, a token that God will destroy the world with water no more, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 14, 15, 16, 17. so God hath sworne to us in his Sonne, that hee will not be wroth with us, nor rebuke us; <hi>For the mountaines shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindnesse shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee</hi> Esay 54. 9, 10. <hi>For I will be mercifull to their unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and their sinnes and their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities will I remember no more,</hi> Heb. 8. 12.
