            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Here followeth a short Narration of the Lord <hi>VVareston's</hi> Carriage before and after the delivery of his last Discourse upon the Scaffold at the Mercat-Cross of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> Iuly <hi>22. 1663.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HIs Carriage all the time from his coming from <hi>London,</hi> was most convincingly Christian, full of tenderness of spirit, and meekness towards all, so that all who were in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, both in the Ship and at other times, asserted they were never in the company of a more godly, sincere, fervent seeker of God, and one that was most sensible of the least tenderness exercised towards himself. Before he came out of the Ship he prayed for a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon his Majesty, and upon State and Kirk. When landed at <hi>Leith,</hi> he enquired for the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>: To which it was answered, They are all silenced and put out of the Town: <hi>Well</hi> (said he) <hi>their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence does preach; and truly Mr.</hi> Douglas, <hi>&amp;c. might have preached ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before State or Kirk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the whole time of his Imprisonment the Lord keeped him in a most spiritual tender frame, even to the conviction of some that hated him formerly. The great thing he most desired was <hi>gracious through-bearing,</hi> which he said was onely to be had through the supply of the Spirit and intercession of the Saints: and the thing he most feared, was, <hi>fainting in the hour of tryal,</hi> and for that cause did earnestly desire that prayer might be fervently put up to God for him; which was indeed done in all parts of the Land, which had its good success in God's own way.</p>
            <p>When he received his Sentence he did receive it with exceeding great meekness, to the admiration of all; desiring the best blessings of Heaven to be upon his Majesty and upon State and Kirk, whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel himself, and that God would give his Majesty true and faithfull Counsellours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The nearer he was to his death, he was the more quieted in his mind, which had been discomposed by Poison, and the drawing of threescore ounces of blood, the Physicians intending hereby to distract him, or make him an ideot fool. The night before his death he sleeped very sweetly, and in the morning was very full of comfort, uttering many
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38195:3"/>
sweet expressions as to his assurance of being cloathed with a long white Robe before night; and of getting a new Song of the Lambs praise put in his mouth. He dined very chearfully, hoping to sup in Heaven, and to drink the next cup fresh and new in his Father's Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thereafter he was alone till the time of his being brought forth.</p>
            <p>As he was led from the Prison (the streets being very full of people bemoaning that sad sight) he cryed, <hi>Your prayers, your prayers.</hi> As he was conveyed by the Cross to the Scaffold, there was a great noise made by the Guards beating off the people, and battering with their Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens over his head, which was somewhat terrible to Spectators, yet not to him; for the Lord kept him very composed, so that he never did so much as once look about to them, but walked forwards with them very peaceably, as a Lamb led to the slaughter: and coming chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the North-side of the Scaffold, spake to the people after this manner; <hi>I entreat you be pleased to quiet your selves a little till this dying man deliver his last words among you.</hi> Likewise he desired his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors not to be offended that he was necessitate to make some use of his Paper, for the help of his memory, which had been fully wasted with long sickness, and the malice of Physicians, who had taken threescore ounces of blood from him at one time, and had given him bad Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick (so called he the Poyson that was given to him) thereafter.</p>
            <p>Then did he begin this following Discourse, which he delivered with very much undaunted courage, audaucity, and quiet of mind, without the least appearance of distemper; but as chearful as ever he had been at any time formerly, when giving any publick Testimony to the Truth, with which singular piece of honour the Lord had often dignified him.</p>

            <head>The last <hi>SPEECH</hi> and <hi>TESTIMONY</hi> of the Right Honourable the Lord WARESTOUNE, as he delivered it at the Mercat-Cross of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> Iuly <hi>22. 1663.</hi> immediately before his Death.</head>
            <salute>RIght Honourable, much honoured, and beloved Auditors and Spectators:</salute>
            <p>That which I intended and prepared to have spoken at this time and in this condition, immediately before my death (if it should be so ordered that this should be my lot) is not at present in my power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from me when apprehended; but I hope the Lord shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, to bear my Testimony more fully and clearly than now I can in this condition, having my memory much destroyed through much, sore and long sickness, melancholy, and the excessive drawing of my blood: yet I bless the Lord, (that notwithstanding all these fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned distempers) I am in any capacity to leave this weak and short Testimony.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I desire in the first place to confess my sins, so far as is proper to this place and case; and to acknowledge God's Mercies; and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press my repentance of the one, and my faith of the other, through the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ our gracious Redeemer and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. I confess that my natural temper hath been hasty and passionate, and that in my manner of going about, and prosecuting of the best pieces of work and service to the Lord, and to my Generation, I have been subject to my excesses of heat, and thereby to some precipitations, which hath no doubt offended standers-by and lookers-on, and exposed both me &amp; the work to their mistakes; wherby the beauty of that Work hath been much obscured. Neither have I in following the Lord's Work, <hi>his Good Work,</hi> been altogether free of self-seeking, to the grief of my own conscience, which hath made me oftentimes to cry out with the Apostle, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> and to lie low in the dust mourning and lamenting over the same, deprecating God's Wrath, and begging his tender Mercies to pardon, and his powerful Grace to cure all these evils. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess withal, that it doth not a little trouble me, lie heavy upon my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and will bring me down with sorrow to the grave (though I was not alone in this offence, but had the Body of the Nation going before
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38195:4"/>
me, and the example of persons of all ranks to ensnare me) that I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered my self through the power of temptations, &amp; too much fear anent the straits that my numerous family might be brought into, to be carried into so great a length of complyance in <hi>England</hi> with the late Usurpers, which did much grieve the hearts of the Godly, and made those that sought God, ashamed and confounded for my sake, and did give no small occasion to the Adversary to reproach and blaspheme; and did withal not a little obscure and darken the beauty of several former Actings about his <hi>glorious and blessed Work of Reformation,</hi> so happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and far advanced in these Lands; wherein he was graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to imploy, <hi>and by imploying to honour me</hi> to be an Instrument, (though the least and unworthiest of many) whereof I am not at all ashamed <hi>this day,</hi> but account it my glory, howevet that work be now cryed down, opposed, laid in the dust and trod upon; And my turning aside to comply with these men, was the more aggravated in my person, that I had so frequently and seriously made profession of my aversness from, and abhorrency of that way, and had shewed much dissatisfaction with others that had not gone so great a length: for which, as I seek God's mercy in Christ Jesus, so I desire that all the Lord's People may, from my example, be the more stirred up to watch and pray, that they enter not into temptation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I dare not deny on the other hand, but must testifie in the second place, to the glory of his free Grace, that the Lord my God hath often shewed, ensured into and engraven upon my conscience, the Testimony of his reconciled Mercy, through the Merits of Jesus Christ, pardoning all my iniquities, and assuring me that he would deliver me also by the Grace of his holy Spirit, from the spait, tyranny and dominion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and hath often drawn forth my spirit to the exercise of Repentance and Faith; and hath often engraven upon my heart in legible chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, the merciful pardoning and gracious-begun cure thereof, to be perfected thereafter to the glory of his Name, Salvation of my own soul and Edification of his Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I am pressed in conscience to leave here at my death, my true and honest Testimony in the sight of God and man, unto and for the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> the solemn Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Sins and Engagements to our Duties, and to all the Grounds and Causes of Fasts and Humiliations, and of the Lord's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure and Contendings with the Land, and to the several Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies given for his Interests by General Assemblies, Commissions of the Kirk, Synods, Presbyteries and other faithful Ministers and Professors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I am also pressed to encourage his doing suffering witnessing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38195:4"/>
People, and sympathizing ones with those that suffer, that they would continue in their duties of mourning, praying, believing, witnessing and sympathizing with others, and humbly to assure them in the Name of the Lord our God, <hi>the God of his own Word and Work, of his Covenant, Cause and People,</hi> that he will be seen, found and felt in his own graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way and time, by his own means and instruments, for his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, to return to his own Truths, Interests and Servants, to revive his Name, his Covenant, his Word, his Work, his Sanctuary, and his Saints in this Nation, yea, even in these three Covenanted Nations, which were by so solemn Bonds, Covenants, Subscriptions and Oaths given away and devoted to himself.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I exhort all those that have been, or are, enemies or unfriendly to the Lord's Name, Covenant or Cause, Word, Work or People, in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to repent and amend before these sad Judgments, that are posting fast, come upon them for their sinning so highly against the Lord, because of any temptations of the time on the right-hand or on the left, by baits or straits whatsoever, and that after so many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements and professions of not a few of themselves to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I dare not conceal from you who are friendly to all the Lord's precious Interests in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the Lord (to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his Grace be it humbly spoken) hath several times in the exercise of my Repentance and Faith (during my troubles) and after groans and tears upon these three notable chapters, <hi>viz.</hi> the ninth of <hi>Ezra,</hi> ninth of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and the ninth of <hi>Daniel,</hi> together with other suitable Scriptures, even in the very nick of humble and fervent prayers and supplications to him, for reviving again of his Name, Covenant, Cause, VVord and Work of Reformation in these Covenanted Nations, and particularly in poor <hi>Scotland,</hi> (yea, O dear <hi>Scotland!</hi>) which solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly re-engaged unto him, to the good example and encouragement of his People in the other two Nations to <hi>covenant</hi> with him also; That the Lord, I say, hath several times given me good grounds of hope, &amp; lively expectations of his merciful, gracious, powerful &amp; wonderful renewing, reviving again of all his former great Interests in these Covenanted Nations, and that in such a way, by such means and instruments, with such antecedents, concurrents, consequences and effects, as shall won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully rejoyce his mourning Friends, and astonish his contradicting and contra-acting Enemies.</p>
            <p>I do earnestly recommend my poor afflicted Wife and Children, and their Posterity, to the choicest Blessings of God, and unto the Prayers and Favours of all the Lord's Children and Servants in their earnest dealihgs with God and man in their behalf, that they may not be ruined
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38195:5"/>
for my sake, but that for the Lord my Gods sake they may be favoured, assisted, supplied, and comforted; and may be also fitted by the Lord for his Fellowship and Service, whom God himself hath moved me often in their own presence, and with their own consents, to dedicate, devote, resign, alike and as well as I devoted and resigned my own soul unto him for all time and eternity.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Now, here I beseech the Lord to open the eyes of all the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my Trouble, who are not deadly irreconcilable Enemies to himself and his People, that they may see the Wrong done by them to his <hi>Interest,</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and to <hi>Me</hi> and <hi>Mine,</hi> and may repent thereof, return to the Lord, and more cordially maintain, own, and adhere unto all his Interests in time to come. The Good Lord give unto them Repentance, Remission, and Amendment, which is the worst wish I do, and the best wish I can, wish unto them; for I can wish no better to my self.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I do most humbly and earnestly begg the Fervent Prayers of all His Praying Children, Servants and Instruments, wheresoever they be, whether absent, or present, to be put up in behalf of His <hi>Name, Cause, Covenant, Work</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> and also in behalf of my <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and their <hi>Posterity,</hi> and that the Lord would Glorifie <hi>Himself,</hi> Edifie his <hi>Church,</hi> Encourage his <hi>Saints</hi> further, and accomplish his [Good Work] by all his Doings and Dealings, in Substances towards all his own.</p>

            </p>
            <p>When he had delivered this Discourse at the North-side of the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, he went about to the South-side, where he delivered it again with the like admirable courage, to the astonishment of all. Then did he pray most fervently (as his manner had alwayes been) with much faith and humility, calling upon God, as a childe upon his tender-hearted father, beginning his supplications (according to the Rule appointed by Christ for direction in Prayer) thus, <hi>Abba, Abba, Father, Father, accept this thy poor sinful Servant, coming unto thee through the Merits of Iesus Christ, &amp;c.</hi> and when speaking of himself spake most humbly, as if he had been the chief of sinners, forgetting the many honourable pieces of Service the Lord had put upon him, wherein he made him eminently instrumental for promoting of his Kingdom in the world. Thereafter he stood very patiently till the Napkin was tyed about his head. <hi>Now,</hi> said this meek Lamb, <hi>you will take it up till I be up the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Yea, my Lord, that shall be done. Then said he, <hi>How will I get it drawn down upon my face?</hi> My Lord, it shall be done for you, do not trouble your self. Then coming to the foot of the Ladder he prayed as formerly, resigning God's Interests and his own soul into the hands of his heavenly Father. Then said one (who had tyed the Cloth about his head) There is no missing of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters here this day, Christ hath made good that blessed word, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Iesus</hi>; And <hi>as tribulation hath abounded for Christ's sake, so hath comfort been encreased by Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 5. For howbeit he had often supplicated for some Ministers to be with him there, yet they would grant a liberty to none, unless he would have accepted of those that had broken in upon the Labours of other faithful Ministers, whom he refused; neither would he have any that approve of, or seem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at the present defection; so that no Minister was upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. Then came the Executioner, desiring him to forgive him; to whom he answered, <hi>The Lord forgive thee, poor man, which I also do</hi>; and giving to him some money in a cloth, bad him do his work aright. After this, one desired the Executioner to go up to the head of the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38195:6"/>
said he, I must go up with him, else he cannot get up. Nay, said he again, Go you up, and do not offer to touch him till it come to your own work, for we shall get him helped up: so the Executioner went up. Then he was conveyed by some in side-mourning to the head of the Ladder, who staid with him, and spake with him all the time he was upon the same. As he ascended he said, <hi>Your prayers, your prayers, I desire your prayers in the Name of the Lord,</hi> so great had alwayes his esteem been of Prayer. As the Cord was going about his precious neck, (being told that many precious Friends were looking on, which seemed to refresh him; for he answered and said, <hi>Is there indeed!</hi> and considering that his chearfulness did much tend to the credit of the Work of God for which he suffered) he cryed out with a very loud and chearful voice, <hi>I beseech you all (who are the Lords People) not to scar at suffering for the Interests of Christ, because of any thing you see fall out in these dayes as to the Sufferings of his Servants; but be encouraged to do, and endure, in suffering for him, and his Interests; for I assure you in the Name of the Lord he will bear all your charges.</hi> The Cord being about his neck, he spake to the same purpose again; <hi>I pray you that are the Lord's People, be encouraged to do and suffer for the Interests of Christ, yea, even for the smallest point of Truth, in your several stations; for he may revive his Work by a very unexpected mean: And I do again assure you in his Name, he will furnish all your expences, and bear all your charges; and he hath graciously comforted me.</hi> Then he enquired if the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner was ready? Yes, if your Lordship be: then said he to the man, <hi>Do your Office</hi>; and so cryed out again, <hi>Your prayers, your prayers, &amp;c.</hi> and with unspeakable composedness and tranquility of mind, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully committing himself into the hands of his tender-hearted heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, the Executioner turned him off the Ladder; at which sight there arose a very lamentable Cry of many thousand Spectators. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thereafter he lifted up his two precious hands to Heaven (as they had been often lifted up in prayer, not only in the day-time, but also in the silent watches of the night) and without the least motion, trembling or shaking of body, which is most ordinary in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, peaceably sleeped away to glory. One of his Sons standing on the Scaffold, weeping, one present took him by the hand, and said, <hi>Sir, be encouraged, for you are very highly honoured this day.</hi> Within a little thereafter he was taken down by Friends that received his body, as the Cord was cut. The Executioner came to take off his Head, and being timerous and seeming as somewhat afraid, he was desired to put away fear and do his work cleanly: so this precious Head was taken off at one stroak, which was afterward set upon the <hi>Nether-Bow Port,</hi> where
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38195:6"/>
it standeth by the blessed Head of that precious and cleanly Martyr, and slain yet witnessing Witness of our Lord Jesus Christ, Mr. <hi>Iames Guthry,</hi> sometime Minister of the Gospel at <hi>Sterling,</hi> upon the South or right-hand of which doth the Head of this latter Martyr stand; so that these two Worthies who in their life-time had alwayes been together, as to those actings that tended to the carrying on of the <hi>Work of Reformation,</hi> wherein they so sweetly agreed, in their death were not divided; but the Heads of these two Worthies, who had witnessed for Christ while living, stand there together confirming the same when dead, and ought to put all the People of God in mind of the Truths they held while li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and walking together, which they sealed with their blood, as true, at their death; according to that saying of worthy and eminent Mr. <hi>Guthrie</hi> at his return to the Prison after the receiving of his Sentence, having told that his Head was to be set upon the <hi>Nether-Bow,</hi> and being enquired by his nearest friend, what should it do there? he answered, <hi>Even to Preach</hi>; and indeed these Heads do preach there: and this was very comfortable to him when he heard in his Sentence that his Head was to be set up by the Head of that faithful, true and stedfast Witness. His Body was carried to the <hi>Grey-Fryar</hi> Kirk-yard, accompanied by many cloathed in deep Mourning, but by many more <hi>Heart-Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> to the number of some thousands, and was buried in the <hi>Iohnstouns</hi> Yle, where it rests and sleeps sweetly, united unto Christ, as in a secret cabinet and retired chamber, whereof our Lord Jesus keepeth the key, till the Resurrection; at which time it shall be raised a glorious shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Body; being <hi>changed and made like unto his glorious Body,</hi> Phil. 3. 20, 21. Thus a Prince and Great man in <hi>Israel</hi> did fall that day; so that <hi>Sampson,</hi> whose hair had been cut, and his strength (as concerning his natural abilities) much wasted, was there restored; and whereas he was brought forth that they might have a day of spott of him (imagining that he would be afraid to dye) having pulled out his eyes in that his Memory after the letting of his blood, and giving him the poison, was so much wasted, that he knew not whether he was <hi>English-man</hi> or <hi>Scots-man, French man</hi> or <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> nor whether <hi>Genesis</hi> or <hi>Revelation</hi> did begin the Bible, nor whether he had or wanted Wife and Children, and so did not remember, even when in Prison, what the behaviour of one should be upon a Scaffold, but as he was told, which he presently did forget again, as also he did forget any thing else was told him, though often repeated in one quarter of an hour; yet that day, and about the time of his suffering, he was so fully restored, as that there was no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of what had formerly been taken from him; and the Lord, the high Supream of Heaven and Earth, shewed his Power from on high; and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38195:7"/>
by commanding and giving strength out of <hi>Zion,</hi> made his precious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant prove a <hi>Sampson</hi> indeed, by a most glorious, undaunted, chearful, heartsom Carriage and faithful Testimony, as one undervaluing <hi>all that man could do unto him,</hi> behaving himself at his death like good old faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful valourous <hi>Warestoun,</hi> who being so full of magnanimity, gave as sore a dash and stroke to the <hi>Prelatical Interest,</hi> (yea, even to the conviction of the owners thereof) and did as much confirm, strengthen, chear up and admirably inhearten them that desire to abide in the Truth, as ever he had done by his former Testimonies, Sealing all with his own blood that formerly he had owned and professed: yea and this was a return of a desire of his own, written in a Letter to a Friend many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, speaking of a particular Testimony for the Covenant, and having shewed how the Lord had keeped possession in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his People against Defection (from generation to generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) he addeth — <hi>O that my blood at the Cross of Edinburgh might seal this Testimony, in prosecution of all the former</hi>; meaning those Testimonies that had been formerly given from time to time against Defection in the preceding ages, which he had mentioned in the Epistle foresaid. Thus the Lord in his own time and way did graciously fulfill that his desire: and by his so strengthening him, making thereby the hearts of strangers sad, and reviving the spirits of his fainting People; did give therein a most signal, evident and rich return of the many supplications which had been put up to the Lord for him, during the whole time of his trouble and imprisonment; which is a great encouragement to pray, for it is not in vain; yea, it's not in vain for the house of <hi>Iacob</hi> to seek his face, who is able to comfort the most dejected, heartless mourners in <hi>Zion</hi>: as also this dealing of the Lord with his suffering Servants, whom he so wonderfully encourageth, is an excellent encouragement to the Godly in such a day as this, to obey the Exhortation which is in the close of the first particular in the foregoing Discourse for guarding against temptation. The good Lord bless these bloody preachings to his People, to make them walk in his way, whatever difficulties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear therein; that the Cloud of Witnesses may not be a standing Witness against us, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THe last words of dying men, being much set by of their affectionate Relations; surely the last words of <hi>dying Witnesses for the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> should be had in very singular account, and that especially upon these three Considerations.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Cons.</hi> 1. Dying sober men, and more especially dying Christians, but most of all dying, testifying, sealing, confirming Witnesses for Christ, must be most sober, and know well upon what grounds they do express their minds, being immediately thereafter to give in their last accounts; and for that cause must take good heed how they put that <hi>last crowning Master-piece</hi> of Work (wherein his Glory is so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned) well and cleanly off their hand, that they may hope <hi>through Grace</hi> to be accepted of him, and even as to that last discourse to have him say unto them, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant, &amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Cons.</hi> 2. Our Lord Jesus Christ, that non-such faithful, tender-hearted, and (in the worst of times) worthy to be followed Master, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving staged them before so many Witnesses for his sake, doth (for the glory and honour of his Majesty, and for the commendation of the hardest pieces of his Service to the hearts of his most fainting People, and for the astonishment of their Adversaries) bestow most large furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon them, suitable to the great and honourable piece of Work given them to perform. Yea, if ever the fulfilling of that promise, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 19. may be expected, <hi>In that hour it shall be given you what ye shall speak; for it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father.</hi> Without all doubt it is then to be expected, when sealing his Truth on a Scaffold or Pillory for his sake: Comforts run most sweetly and abundantly in that hour. When Jesus is to suffer, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 43. an Angel is sent to comfort him. When <hi>Stephen</hi> is to deliver his last speech and to suffer, <hi>he is filled with the holy Ghost,</hi> so that all that sat in the Council looking stedfastly on <hi>Stephen,</hi> saw his face as if it had been the face of an Angel; his soul was so warmed by the Love of God that he looked both his Adversaries and the tempestuous approaching Storm out of countenance: O but when he is to be stoned he gets a larger sight, he saw the Heavens opened, and his majestick glorious Master,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38195:8"/>
the Light-giving Diamond of Heaven, <hi>standing at his Fathers right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, Act.</hi> 7. 55. If his face was as the face of an Angel, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 5. O how chearfull hath his countenance and lovely smiles been now? I think I see him smiling on Heaven while the stones were going about his ears: and this he got, no doubt, as for himself, so to hearten all those that were to come after, he being the first Martyr after Christ; and no Martyr or slain Witness hath left a discouraging report behind them of a suffering lot since that day; but all have had an encrease of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from Christ as Trouble for Christs sake encreased unto them: they had more Comfort when in Prison than formerly; more strength when before the Council than oftentimes in the Prison; but most of all upon the Scaffold at their suffering, according to that comfortable experience of the Apostles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>As our Tribulation aboundeth for Christ, so doth our Consolation abound by Christ</hi>; they have not all in hand, ere they enter in a suffering condition, that's needful to carry them thorow, but the Lord lets it out to them as need requireth, which is very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to such faint-hearted ones, as think they will never have courage to suffer; for the Apostle adds, ver. 7. —<hi>our hope of you is stedfast, that as ye are partakers of the Suffering, so shall you be also of the Consolation, i. e.</hi> as you share <hi>of such sufferings</hi> as we meet with, <hi>so shall ye also</hi> have a share <hi>of such Consolations</hi> under your Sufferings as the Lord alloweth upon us. Thus the Lord doth to this very day, as our eyes have seen, our ears have heard, and our tongues have been made from such infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible experiences to confess to God's Glory and our Comfort. And as this Consideration is very comforting and quieting to our mind, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so should it make us have a very good esteem of Scaffold-Sermons, seeing it's the Lord enableth them by his comforting presence to speak.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Cons.</hi> 3. The Lord hath a very great care of what his staged dying Witnesses say, and that they speak nothing there but what is true; he ordereth the whole matter of the Discourses of sincere Witnesses; so that as they are Witnesses for Truths as formerly owned by them, so are they Witnesses in like manner, as to what they deliver at their death, concerning those Truths for the time to come: they are sealing Witnesses as to what expectation they give the People of God ground to have for the time to come, whether as relating to the punishment of them that oppose or fail away from those Truths, or as to the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the owners of, and sufferers for the same: Hence is it that some faithful dying Martyrs have adventured to say much more, and been more peremptory in their encouraging the Lord's People on the Scaffold, than in their written Discourse ere they were led from Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: He changes their premeditations when they come to the Scaffold,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38195:8"/>
and giveth them what is his mind in that hour. So he did with his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and constant Witness Mr. <hi>Ia. Guthrie,</hi> that which was written in his discourse by way of hope (as it is also in the printed discourse) was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered on the Scaffold by way of full assurance, thus; <hi>Howbeit our Cloud may be long or dark, yet I am perswaded, that the Lord shall once more shine with the glorious Light of the Gospel upon these Lands, &amp;c.</hi> And the Lord did (in a manner) confirm this from Heaven; for whereas there had been a very thick Rain from the time of his coming upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold till he had uttered these words, and then with that very Assertion of his Assurance (as if it had been in one moment) the Rain was cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the whole Firmament of Heaven cleansed of all Clouds, and the Sun shining as clear as if it had been after an Eclipse, and so continued til setting. This divers faithful Witnesses did observe, as an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to wait for the performance thereof. So we may see that as he gives quiet and peace of mind (anent their owning these Truths formerly) and power to suffer for the same; He likewise giveth Light &amp; strength of Faith as to what they say of God's owning the same for the time to come, and so are dying sealing Witnesses of what they encourage the Lord's People to look for: It's true, the thing they witness for the time to come consists most in the strength of Hope, which God ordereth beyond their most lively apprehension; and what they own as to what is past, hath the more clearness in this respect, that there is a certain infallible knowledge of the truth of it, being according to the Word of God, and already come to pass. We will find something in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to confirm what we have said in this Consideration; for we will find that what hath been asserted by suffering dying Witnesses hath most speedily come to pass. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.20. <hi>Zachariah</hi> told the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel, Because ye have forsaken the Lord, he hath also forsaken you</hi>; and for this he was immediatly stoned, and the Lord sealed his word very speedily thereafter, for ver. 24. the <hi>Assyrians</hi> coming with a small company against them, the Lord delivered a very great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude into their hand, and so without delay in their sight sealed the words of his dying Witness <hi>Zachariah.</hi> And why his word sooner than <hi>Isaiahs, Ieremiahs, Ezekiels, &amp;c.</hi>? for by them he pleaded much longer as would seem with his Apostatizing Church, it may be, that he might shew that whatever fail, the words of dying Witnesses shall not fall to the ground.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But some may object here and say, <hi>Simple Instances from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot prove an Assertion of this nature; and besides, this of Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah and others of this kind, were Prophecies directed from God by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the Prophets, and so could not but come to pass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

                  </gap>
               </hi> It is true, Instances cannot prove such Assertions, neither is it our intent to seem to make it infallibly out; neither to bid the People of God lay such weight upon these sayings, as they must lay upon the Prophecies which are written in the Scriptures, being the ground of our Faith: for though such sayings may be true Prophecies, whereof we may in moderation look for the accomplishment, as that of Mr. <hi>Iohn Wishart</hi> concerning Cardinal <hi>Beaton,</hi> was a true Prophecy; Yet we are not infallibly assured that these are Prophecies, till they be accomplished: all we attempt here is to give the People of God ground of expectation of good in the latter end (whereunto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and consideration of his ordering his Servants discourse at their death very much conduceth, and to give the Lord his own free lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to do or forbear in these things, as he in the depth of his Holy Wisdom sees expedient. But, 2. howbeit these were Prophecies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected from God, and so could not fail; yet we find also that the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions of slain dying Witnesses, were frequently more speedily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished than most of other Prophecies, as is clear in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Scripture, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 20,24. Howbeit, I say, this which ye will find clear; yet I am not meaning that we should still look for a speedy accomplishment of Scaffold-discourses, all I plead for from this is, that the Lord hereby seemeth to give us ground to think that such discourses will be fulfilled in due time; for other Prophecies were as true as that of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> but his soonest fulfilled: And if it be not lawful for us to conclude speedy outgates, because of such discourses, yet that he will fulfill these words we may (in sobriety) expect. It is true also, some other Prophecies were as soon fulfilled as <hi>Zachariahs,</hi> as <hi>Isa.</hi> 37. 33,34. was fulfilled, ver. 36. But this and the like, were Prophecies of Mercie and Deliverance to a humbled broken People, and for the speedy fulfillment whereof these Reasons may be given. 1. God delights much in Mercy, and makes haste in fulfilling gracious Promises. 2. There was a present necessity of the fulfilment thereof, both in respect of the Lord's People, who were humbled before God, and immediatly to be ruined, if he had not fulfilled his Word. 3. The Promise or Prophecy was made as to that instant of time; for if it had not been fulfilled at the instant whereunto it did relate, it could have been no Prophecy; for when a Prophecy comes of something to be done at such a time (where no condition is expressed nor understood) it must be fulfilled at that time, else it could not be said to be a Prophecy; such was <hi>Isaiah's,</hi> Isa. 37. 33,34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that which we speak of, is, as relating to the threatnings uttered by dying Witnesses, and such as could have been suspended as well as others, without any apparent hurt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38195:9"/>
to the truth of Prophecy, yet is quickly fulfilled, yea, sooner than other Prophecies of the same nature; yea, and possibly for this very end, to put a tincture of respect beyond ordinary upon the words of dying <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>: for, as we have said, consider the prophetical denunciations of wrath by <hi>Znchariah,</hi> a dying <hi>slain Witness,</hi> and the prophetical denunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of wrath by <hi>Ieremiah, Ezekiel, &amp;c.</hi> and why comes <hi>Zachariah's</hi> Prophecy sooner to pass than <hi>Ieremiah's,</hi> this not being limited to a certain time, and therefore might have been suspended as well as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiahs,</hi> without prejudice to the Prophecy? I know none but this: 1. It was the Lord's pleasure, and 2. to shew his <hi>respect to dying Witnesses,</hi> that he would have what they say taken especial notice of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Likewise this Consideration may be confirmed by the Lord's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing the last words of his Servants, both in the primitive and latter times, we shall only mention one instance more, and that is the prophetical discourse of godly &amp; famous Mr. <hi>Geo. Wishart,</hi> who as he had much of God's mind in his lifetime (as is clear in the history of his life in Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> Martyrology) so was his last words well ordered by the Lord, for when he was burning in the fire at <hi>St. Andrews</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and seeing the Cardinal looking out at a window, feeding upon the sight of this sad tragedy, prophesied <hi>that he should be thrown out at the same win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow ere long</hi>; and as he said, so the Lord brought it quickly to pass, to the great joy and comfort of his People.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This may help to confirm what we say in this Consideration anent his ordering and directing the last discourses of his <hi>suffering Servants, viz.</hi> It very much tendeth to the clearing of their Cause, as being his, when he fulfilleth their <hi>Scaffold Discourses</hi>: and as they are tender of his Glory, laying down their lives for his sake; so is he tender both of his own and their credit, that they may not bring the imputation of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved witnesses upon themselves at death: and, as it was formerly assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if ever the accomplishment of that promise can be expected, or is fulfilled at any time in this world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>It shall be given you at that same hour what ye ought to speak</hi>; it may be expected by, and is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled unto his <hi>dying Witnesses</hi> on the Scaffold. For when (I pray you) is it to be expected if not then? and how often hath he made the truth of that appear which he addeth, <hi>for it is not ye,— but the Spirit of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that speaketh in you?</hi> and who can say that ever the Lord suffered his suffering, testifying, sealing, confirming and dying Witnesses to be mistaken in their last discourse? yea, which may confirm it yet more, let me see the man in all the world (friend or foe) that can bring an instance of one dying, witnessing Martyr, who spake that at his death, which the Lord did not (in due time) some way or other accomplish; yea, I defy to bring me one faithful slain Witness that was suffered to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38195:10"/>
be in a mistake at his death and in his last testimony, even from <hi>Abels</hi> dayes to our own time? and let them that judge this a rash impertinent expression, see how they will clear themselves of denying that promise of our Lord, <hi>it shall be given you in that same hour what ye ought to speak</hi>; and so I leave it to the Lord to defend.</p>
            <p>Now by all this it may appear that he reveals secrets to dying Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, which he keeps up from many others who are also dear unto him; so that howbeit their words be not to be esteemed of equal weight with the written and infallible Scriptures (<hi>a surer Word than if a voice were speaking from Heaven,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 9.) yet their sayings, while dying for, and in the Lord, do give good encouragement unto them that remain alive, and so to be much esteemed by them. And truly the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, together with his fulfilling (or at least having ever hitherto fulfilled) the words of his slain Witnesses, together with what our Lords slain Witnesses have asserted for the time to come, concerning his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of his now languishing dying Work, is very encouraging to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise patience, and not to faint while meeting with dark and tempestuous dispensations: and first consider what our Lords first honourable slain Witness spake at his death, <hi>viz. These times will be either times of great suffering, or great sinning; and they that will be free of sinning shall not escape suffering, and they that will shun suffering shall not escape sinning, there is a Dilemma in the matter; sin or suffer. And truly for my own part I may think it a mercy that I have been so hardly dealt with; for if I had met with more favour as others have, I might have sinned as others have done, and as more will yet do if the Lord do not prevent.</hi> And is not this sadly evidenced! O what dreadful defection and apostatizing from the Truth since that day! Have not many confirmed that Prophecy against themselves, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 2, 3. breaking the Lord's bonds and casting away his cords? Have not many since that day (notwithstanding the seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Truths by the blood of his Witnesses) declared that God's blessed Work was but a <hi>Rebellious Combination?</hi> and this they have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed with their hands, howbeit it was a precious mean of prospering the Father's pleasure in the hand of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of his seeing the fruit of the sore travel of his soul to his great comfort, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10, 11. If it had been but a combination of men, could so many souls have been converted while it was on foot? Nay, blessed be our God, he hath put it out of doubt among us, by making his Son's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom flourish more in its time than ever since the Apostles dayes. Our Lord hath said, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. <hi>The works that I do, bear witness of me.</hi> It's dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous calling the work of the holy Ghost <hi>a Combination of men,</hi> and his operation upon souls the <hi>fruit of Rebellion</hi>: it is the sin against the holy Ghost to say, <hi>he casteth out Devils through Beelzebub,</hi> Mat. 12.24, 31. and
<pb facs="tcp:38195:10"/>
calling the effects and fruits of Reformation, <hi>the effects of an unlawful Combination,</hi> comes near to this sin. Now this work, this <hi>blessed work</hi> is condemned, and the <hi>Covenant</hi> that opened the door thereunto is abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by many, whereby they have renounced their share and interest in the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Work of Reformation,</hi> and of what too-look they seemed to have unto the comforts attending or following upon the same, which is a dreadful business; for our <hi>Covenant</hi> is nothing else but a solemn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press declaration of our being satisfied with the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and that upon the conditions whereupon the Lord offers it unto us; 2. our formal express national acceptation thereof upon these terms; and 3. our promising and engaging by his grace to fulfill these conditions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hazard of forfeiting and losing our interest in that Covenant and all its blessings, priviledges and advantages. And howbeit a chief and main Article in the Covenant of Grace by the Lord's engaging to make us fulfill our part of that Covenant, yet he never tenders mercy to us but upon condition of our taking and owning him for our God, Head, and Lord in Jesus Christ, and that we will worship him according to his own appointment in his Word: and if you compare our Covenant with the Duties God requires of his New-Testament Church, ye shall find nothing whereunto we are obliged in it, but that which God requires of us, as the conditions upon which he is content to agree with us in the Covenant of Grace, and therfore <hi>quaeritor</hi> (which to me is no question) whether to abjure the <hi>Covenant</hi> that binds us to fulfill the conditions of the Covenant of Grace, be not indeed to abjure, upon the matter, the <hi>Covenant of Grace it self,</hi> seing they say they will not fulfil the conditions thereof? O horrid desperate work! they have quitted their share of all the comforts attending this Covenant, for time and eternity; for this is no such breach, as is committed through weakness, ignorance, &amp;c. this is a clear, deliberate, formal, express up-giving with him; and to make all sure, they have given under their hands <hi>that they judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obliged not to keep the same</hi>; and have given him assurance that he needs expect no better at their hands hereafter; for they declare they judge all such Promises and Engagements to serve him, utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and this is their last answer to him as the desperate result of all the pains he hath taken on them. Now as this part of this honourable Witnesse's discourse is accomplished, so I hope shall the rest in due time as to what he said for encouragement to the Lords People. 2. Faithful Mr. <hi>Guthrie,</hi> who had much of the Lord's mind in his lifetime, gave ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great ground of comfort, <hi>to them that lament after the Lord, he will yet again revive his Work in</hi> Britain <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>by the power of His Spirit, for he hath not cast away his People, &amp;c.</hi> and the Lord seemed to confirm this from Heaven. 3. This blessed Witness gave also much ground of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and it will be the more comfortable, if we consider that
<pb facs="tcp:38195:11"/>
he did it, as a duty whereunto he was pressed in soul, viz. <hi>to comfort the Lord's People in the assurance of his appearing for his Word, his work, his C<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>use, his Covenant; and that in such a way, by such means and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with such antecedents, concurrences and effects as shall wonderfully comfort his People, &amp;c.</hi> see pag. 7. Now may not this threefold Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, together with the consideration of the Lord's guiding the last <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ealing and Scaffold-discourses of his Witnesses, encourage the Lord's People to exercise patience in waiting for him, who will fulfill his Word? <hi>for in Mount-Zion and in Ierusalem shall be deliverance,</hi> as the <hi>Lord</hi> hath said, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 32. And here I cannot pass by an expression of this Witness in a <hi>Letter</hi> formerly mentioned, pag. 12. viz. <hi>Shall we not account the taking and renewing of the Covenant, in the years</hi> 1580, 81, 90, <hi>and again</hi> 1638, <hi>and then again</hi> 1643 <hi>and</hi> 48, <hi>as good as a threefold Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Lords, [even so I take her, even so I take her] into an indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvable Match</hi>: and this threefold Proclamation is sealed by a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold witness, who confirmed and subscrived the same with their blood, venturing upon death and eternity with all chearfulness and tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of soul, owning and avowing the same: and truly they were known to have more of God's mind, and had nearer access unto him than all their opposers. Certainly this must be a very good Cause that giveth so much quiet, peace and joy to the owners thereof at death, for they are ravished and transported with inexpressible joy that ever they were made instrumental for God in carrying on that <hi>Work,</hi> and helped of him to suffer for the same: And upon the other hand, the <hi>work</hi> that's now carried on in the Church must be very bad; for the owners of it dare not own it at death, but are discouraged when they cannot mend their folly: some of them have cryed out on death-bed, <hi>O do you think there may be mercy for abjuring the Covenant? for ten thousand worlds I would not endure that one hour which I endure night and day, if I could shun it, &amp;c.</hi> they would gladly die in Covenant with God though they will not live so. Good Lord keep all his People, and me also, from owning that cause in our life which we dare not own at death, yea, and which the very owners thereof would disown at death; and no wonder, for they dare not look God in the face; <hi>The good Lord give repentance speedily to any of them he minds to save, that they may come out of that dangerous, desperate and soul-destroying condition, wherein they cannot expect to be saved.</hi>
