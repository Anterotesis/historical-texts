            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Vch honoured, and reſpected in the Lord; its no time to dwel upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate paſſages, all our ſpare houres are too few for publique prayers and praiſes: <note place="margin">Peters En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement.</note> of thoſe I have ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing already, I only adde this for the preſent. The eſtate of the Church abroad, or States aſſembled at home, challenge our utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances in that kinde. Of theſe I cannot (indeed, who can?) ſay enough. The mercies of God are wonderfull towards us, as men, as Christians, as Engliſh Chriſtians. When I lay our ſelves by other Nations and Churches, I cannot reade what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to his Iſrael, and not make it ours. Happy art thou O England, who is like vnto thee, O People ſaved by the Lord? &amp;c. Deut. <hi>33.29.</hi> For what Nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them (the onely glory of a Nation)
<pb facs="tcp:21381:3"/>as the Lord our God is, in all things that we call upon him for Deut. <hi>4.7.</hi> What publique ſuite did we ever preferre that did not proſper? inſtance one; nay judge, what could have beene done more for this Vineyard, that the Lord hath not done in it? Eſa <hi>5.4.</hi> If peace be worth thanks, we have had it, if plenty, wee have had it, if victory, wee have had it, if the Goſpel, if all, wee have had all; if wee have loſt anything, thanke unthankefulneſſe, if we looſe more, it will bee our owne fault: for God takes no forfeiture, but what unthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe makes.

Wee bee too ſhort, if wee ariſe no higher than to Gods bleſſings: the bleſſed God is farre and farre beyond all created bleſſings; he is better than health, than wealth, than peace, <note place="margin">Iam 1.1.</note> than grace: all theſe be but ſtreames that lead us to the fountain, but beams that guide our eyes to that father of lights, to that Sonne of righteouſneſs, <note place="margin">Mal. 4.2.</note> God reconciled, God incarnate; God, made ours by his own gift and goodneſſe, is our peace, our helpe, <note place="margin">Pſ. 18.1.2.</note> our health, our life, our every thing, as <hi>David</hi> can never ſay enough this way: and when wee ſee, and taste, and feele all comfort, ſweetneſſe, happineſſe in him, and there upon unite our

Let us not then looke upon health, peace, other bleſſings in themſelves, looke upon them as they bee in God; ſee him healing, bleſſing, ſaving: nay looke not ſo much what hee is to us, as what hee is to the whole body, nay, what he is in his Chriſt, nay, what in his bleſſed ſelfe: how glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, how rich, how good, how far above all creatures, <note place="margin">Nch. 9.52.</note> all prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, all thoughts: O the pretiouſnes of his thoughts to us! O the height, depth, breadth, length of his love in Chriſt: theſe cannot be fadomed by a <hi>David,</hi> by a <hi>Paul:</hi> but O the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, bottomleſſe ſea of beauty, glory, excellency, power, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, goodneſſe, that is in the fountaine it ſelfe! O the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſplendor that is in that un approcheable light, that no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall eye, no immortall Angell can be hold; here not to looſe our ſelves in admiration, is not to loue; not to beer apt and ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the Church, is not to praiſe aright: Aad thus we ſhall never praiſe, till we ſee the great God in the leaſt mercy, <note place="margin">Pſ. 51.15.</note> and an univerſall good in particular bleſſings, nay, when wee doe ſo, unleſſe God open the mouth and enlarge the heart, our lips will not praiſe him: therefore we muſt have helpe from God if ever we will ſing to him: <note place="margin">Aug.</note> For as no man can define God without God, ſo neyther can he praiſe him. Labour therefore to be ſild with the fulnes of God, with the Word of God, Col. <hi>3.16.</hi> with the Spirit of God, Eph. <hi>5.13.</hi> with the comforts and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, and then our mouthes will be full of ſongs, then we ſhall ſing to his Name, as the Prophet ſaith, <note place="margin">Pſ. 63.52.</note> magnifie him, live to him, doe all to him, which is true life, true thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. This is that thankeſ giving which here I call upon every Reader to performe, eſpecially upon my ſelfe, and my Chriſtian friends about the City. It hath pleaſed God to wound and heale us as he de did <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> there are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us, who did not (I thinke) receive in our ſelves the ſentence of death, is <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did: now we are reſtored to life againe, what ſhould we doe, but ſing with him all the dayes of our life? I have begun to you, as I was then able, when God
<pb facs="tcp:21381:4"/>(after perſonall and domeſticall ſickneſſes) brought me into his Houſe; I beſeech you ſecond me, and let not any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice fruſtrate my exhortation.</p>
            <p>Truth it is, I have not beene able to anſwer your loves, your deſires; but reckon that amongst my croſſes, not my faults: Tis true, I undertooke you with much feare, but that did ſlow frons your ſufficiency, and mine owne inabilities. I left you quickly; tis true, and in ſo doing, if I did not deſerve praiſe, here I am, I did pitry. Beloved, I never had, I never looke to have in this pilgrimage, that comfort in my labours that there I found: What daſhed ſo hopefull beginnings, time will ſpeake when I am ſpeechleſſe. In the meane, I am upon a better argument: When I ſpeake of man, I ſpeake of a poore nothing; I am now in ſpeech of the great King, Pſal 45.1. When I ſpeake of mens infirmities (as needs I muſt, if I will heale my ſelfe) I am raking in a channell; <note place="margin">Traducatur nomen ſibi ut appar humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas domini. Chry. ad Pop. Ant. hom. 12.

As for wilfulneſſe (which will not yeeld to truth, becauſe tis wedded to fancy, and paſſion) and ignorance, <note place="margin">Foelix ſeelus virtus vocarur, &amp; contrà.</note> (which names vertues and vices from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent) they are unſatisfiable. Me thinks this concluſion ſhould content modeſty. If at any time, in any thing I have given offence, I humbly crave a par<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Cor. <hi>1.17.</hi> as a Reprobate, <hi>2.</hi> Cor. <hi>13.7.</hi> And now my worthy friends, let mee proceede in my exhortation. Should I not love you, I were not a man: for your love to mee hath exceeded all deſert and expectation; and all the while ſome (by occaſion of your call) have gamed more by my poore labours, than I can poſſibly looſe, I have no reaſon to repent me of this acquaint ance, but more abundant cauſe of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, and loving you; only whereas I could not here to fore in perſon correſpond as was fit, let me at leaſt in writing make
<pb facs="tcp:21381:4"/>that expreſſion of my love, that I am able, before I goe the way of all fleſh. Now what expreſſions can be expected from a Preacber, but praiers, praiſes, exhortations, &amp;c? When you dyed, I prayed for you as I could: now you live, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with you, and call upon you to ſing with me.

I ever dealt freely with you, let me not now alter. Famce ſaith, that London is as couetous, as proud, as wanton, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure as ever. I cannot beleeve it: it is almoſt impoſſible, that ſo great a judgement, ſo gracious a deliverance ſhould ſo ſoone be buryed. Alas (London) thou haſt as yet ſcarce buryed thy dead: the noiſe of bels, the cry of parents, the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings of thy widdowes are not yet out of thine cares, the grim face of death ſtands yet in thy ſight, thy bloudy wounds are ſcarcely ſtanched as yet: If thou couldſt forget judgements, thou canſt not bee unſenſible of Gods mercies and thy change. If London ſhould, yet doe not you (Beloved,) let others ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity bee your feare, others impenitency your ſorrow; and the leſſe others take to heart Gods great, Gods remarkeable workes, by ſo much the more doe you improve the ſame to all holy purpoſes. More would I ſay to you, but that I have prevented my ſelfe in my more publique exbortation; both that and this (more privately ſpoken out of my ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and affection to you) I now commend to your ſerious conſideration and Gods bleſſing, who alone can ſpeake to the heart, beſeeching him, <note place="margin">

               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>O heere a double condition and behaviour of King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah;</hi> 1. he was ficke, and then he prayed: 2. he is recovered, and now he gives thankes. Our buſineſſe lyes in this latet part; which is made up of theſe two: 1. an Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2. a Deſcription of the Song.</p>
            <p>The Deſcription preſents unto us the parts of it; 1. an aggravation of <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> former miſery: 2. an amplification of the preſent mercie.</p>
            <p>The Inſcription acquaints us, 1. with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Song, King <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> 2. with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, a Poem written. 3. with the argument of it, a Song of thankeſgiving for the remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21381:7"/>of ſicknes, &amp; reſtoring of health. And firſt to the firſt: the paſſage is cleer, ſick <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prayes, &amp;c.</p>

               </note> praiſes. Prayers and prayſes do not ſo enterfaire that they can never be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither is there anie neceſsitie of premiſing pertitions to each particular thankſgiving; onely in a generalitie this is regular, when we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved afflictions by prayer, we ſhould welcome deliverances with ſongs. So much was 1. eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Law, <note place="margin">Shelamim.</note>

Its a generall Canon, <hi>Is any afflicted?</hi> what if? <hi>Let him pray; Is any merry?</hi> what then? <hi>Let him ſing.</hi> Tis not unlawfull to pray in mirth, to ſing in miſerie, ordinarily; but tis ſimply neceſſarie in afflictions ro be prayerfull, in the midſt of mercies to bee thankefull, and to entertaine ſeverall conditions with different behaviours. Hereof is it that the Apoſtle. S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo often linke prayers and thankſgivings together: as who would ſay, when the one is put over, you muſt paſſe to the other. So much (3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>.) upon particular occaſions is 1. preſcribed by God, 2. practiſed by his Saints. Particulars will not bee needefull to men who know the generall courſe of Scriptures.

Education and Reaſon taught Heathens, and muſt perſwade us. For, firſt, <note place="margin">Reaſ. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> if wee looke to God, he is (as the Prophet ſaith) worthy to bee praiſed; 1. all excellencie is his, therefore all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſaith reaſon in Philoſophers. 2. All Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is due to him, therefore all thankes, which is a religious act; for to the higheſt Maieſtie is due the loweft ſubjection, and that is Religion, which ſubjects the ſoule. 3. Hee is the firſt ſpring and author of good: all excellencie and honour is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in him, and derived from him, and therfore muſt returne to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If we conſider the thing it ſelfe; <note place="margin">Reaſ. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> thankes is due after mercies received, and wee cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it without many incongruities: firſt (as is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied) Religion is violated, which tels us that wee 1. owe to God all poſsible ſervice; 2. that thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving is a ſpeciall worſhip, wherin we transferre all honour from creatures to God, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 50. <hi>ult.</hi> 3. that wee are no leſſe bound to acknowledge Gods workings in our praiſes, than his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in our prayers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Charitie is violated, which bids us love an enemy, much more a God; to bleſſe thoſe that curſe, much more thoſe that bleſſe us; to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21381:8"/>evil with good, much more to anſwer good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with goodneſſe. <note place="margin">V. Ariſt. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks.</note> Indeed kindneſſe, by the rules of friendſhip &amp; love in the Heathens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth challenge eyther recompence, if we deale with our matches, or acknowledgement where the diſtance is great; &amp; the greater this, the greater that. Now betwixt God &amp; us the diſtance is infinite, and if twere poſsible our love &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe ſhould fill up that diſtance, and extend it ſelfe into infiniteneſſe.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, not to bee as forward with our praiſes as prayers, argues baſe ſelfe-love and ſervilitie, and makes it appeare that wee love not God but his gifts; nay, in truth that wee ſecretly hate him. For wee begrudge no man the praiſe of his kindneſſe, but whom wee eyther envie or hate: now God is above the reach of our low envie; and therefore our lothneſſe to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, proceeds from our inbred enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, when of the twaine wee had rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie his grace, than yeeld our ſelves beggars and dependants,</p>
            <p n="3">3 Iuſtice is violated: we owe God thankes, 1. in point of Law and covenant; Tis our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, our promiſe, our cheefage and rent that is due to him: <note place="margin">Gratia ſpecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis pars juſtitiae. Cic. l. <hi>2.</hi> de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zent.</note> ſo that the Orator ſpake not over, when he intimated that Ingratitude was a kinde of Unjuſtice. For what more unjuſt, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, againſt all deſert and covenant, Gods right? 2. In point of moralitie and honeſtie; in manners wee muſt reciprocate with men, much more with God: nor can he be an honeſt man, who is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21381:8"/>to be an unthankfull man.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If wee compare the dueties, <note place="margin">Reaſ. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> no reaſon but we ſhould be as full of thankes as prayers: 1. I am ſure we have as many mercies as croſſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts (in preſent and reverſion) as wants. 2. All our ſorrowes and afflictions are deſerved, all our comforts undeſerved: if that muſt not weaken our prayers, ſurely this muſt greaten our thankes. 3. Thankfulneſſe will become us as much as beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nay (as the Prophet adds) as much benefit vs, <note place="margin">Chryſ.ad pop. Ant.Hom. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note> as much comfort us: Thankefulneſſe holds old mercies, and wins new; yea, greater thankfulneſſe is a ſurer evidence of love and ſinceritie than prayer, and no leſſe a cauſe than a ſigne of joy; if not ſenior to prayer in the world, yet of more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, at leaſt of more excellencie in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Once, it is at leaſt as needfull for us to give up praiſes as prayers, for theſe reaſons: Firſt, we are (for certaine) as forgetfull of the conſolations as of croſſes, nay more, becauſe we are more ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all than intellectuall, and fulleſt of ſelfe-love. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we are as likely to miſcarrie in proſperity as in adverſitie, unleſſe the one bee ſanctified by thankſgiving, as well as the other by prayer. As Croſſes without prayer will embitter us, ſo Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings without praiſes will ſwell us, and make us giddie, unleſſe wee allay our wine with ſome of this ſugar, thankes I meane, which is ſweet in it ſelfe, moſt comfortable to us, <note place="margin">Cant. 7 9.</note> and more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God than ſweeteſt Wines or Incenſe.</p>
            <p>Well, we heare what ſhould be; <note place="margin">Vſe <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> now by way
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21381:9"/>of reflection lets doe two things: whereof the firſt is: fee what wee have done. Prayers and praiſes ſhould ſucoced each other, as day doth night ſummer winter; what ſay you? hath it bin ſo? The truth is, when I caſt my thoughts back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto publick proceedings, I find what doth ſomewhat comfort mee; I finde, firſt, that after publicke humiliations in 88. our moſt happy Queene was moſt publicke and ſolemne in her thankſgivings: next, after our deliverance in 1604. <hi>Nov.</hi> 5. a ſet time appointed for ſolemne praiſes; thirdly, after deliberation had, ſome thankſgivings added to our publick prayers. But when we looke into private paſſages, alas wee are all too blame: we goe to God in our diſtreſſes, as Turkes uſe to goe to their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or others to their Ladie, by troupes and Caravans; but when we be delivered, we returne like thoſe Lepers in the Goſpell, ſcarce one in ten, in twentie, in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. To ſpeake ſooth, moſt of us have ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to glorie in our praiers; they be too faint, too few, too much overrun with pride &amp; unbeleefe: but in thankeſgiving wee are ſtarke naught, worſe than naught. firſt, we will not ſee wood for trees, mercies for bleſſings; when wee cannot tell how to looke beſides them, we will not fall upon them in our thoughts: wants we ſee, and ſo are ſtill cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; favours wee will not ſee, and ſo are never thankfull. When ſpeech is of croſſes, wee have all; croſſes in body, croſſes in ſoule, croſſes in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, croſſes in friends, our life is made of croſſes: when of mercies, we can finde none about houſe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21381:9"/>no money in purſe, no corne in barne, no comfort in the houſe, no friend in the world, wee ſee no land, nothing but ſea.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when wee ſee, wee will not ſpeake: when we fall upon croſſes, wee are cloquent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond truth, we adde, we multiply, we ariſe in our diſcourſe, like him in the Poet, I am twice, thrice miferable, nay ten times, nay twentie times, <note place="margin">Aristop. in Plut. Act. <hi>4.</hi> ſc. <hi>3.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> nay a thouſand times miſerable; But when it comes to mercies, we ſpeake of them as malefactors doe of their faults, yeelde no more than what can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from us, or proved againſt us, as if we were loath to peach God or our ſelves. Or if (thirdly) wee ſay any thing, it is rather to ſet up our ſelves than God, and the ſacrifice is intended to our netts, witts, providence, more than to Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: in truth we ſerve our ſelves in praiſes as Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norants doe in prayers, they ſet up fleſh and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaliſh merit; under a colour of prayer; and wee under a flouriſh and varniſh (of God be thanked) vent our pride, and ſtroke our ſelves. The worſt unthankfulneſſe is, when men love not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to God. Or laſtly, if ſome thing bee ſaid; thats all, for little is done: True thankefulneſſe ſtands in a reciprocation of affections &amp; actions. Wee ſhould returne love for love, and ſervice at leaſt for kindneſſe; but wee doe not ſo. It fares with us as once with Iſrael; the care, which taſtes words as the raſte doth meats, <note place="margin">V. Chryſ. hom. <hi>11</hi> ad pop. Ant. Anima tristis non and it.</note> was ſo filled with choler, that they could reliſh no comfort (<hi>Exed.</hi> 6.9.) whileſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſpake: and our thoughts bee ſo ſowred with the taſte of croſſes,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21381:10"/>that we can taſte no mercies, at leaſt wee cannot taſte the ſweetneſſe of the giver in the gift; and thence it is that our affections lye dead within us, whilſt his mercies ſwarme about us. Hee ſhewes his power in the greatneſſe, his wiſedome in the ſeaſonableneſſe, his truth in the conſtancie, his grace in the freeneſſe, the riches of his mercies in the fulneſſe of his bleſſings; but nor one nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affect us. Our hearts are ſo farre from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> zeale hereupon, as that (like <hi>Nabals</hi>) they are cyther as cold or heavie as a ſtone. Miſerable hearts, and miſerably dead, when ſo manic war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and reviving comforts cannot raiſe them upwards: but in the meane, what hope of quicke actions, when we labour with ſo dead affections.</p>

            <p>For the firſt, the Lord hath caſt upon us bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, not only undeſerved but undeſired, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; he hath beene better to, us than his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, than our prayers, than our hopes: hee hath prevented us with ſome which wee never fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, yea done more for us than we are aware of; and he hath given us others, which wee never durſt once hope for.

But tis done; hee was made fleſh, ſeene of angels, ſlain of men, laid in grave, raiſed to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and we are now redeemed, juſtified, ſanctified, glorified in him. Redeemed, juſtified, ſanctified, glorified! what words be theſe: what things? No man, no Angell can conceive the worth of theſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21381:12"/>things: when wee have ſaid all, all is this, God hath given us Chriſt, that is, God hath given us himſelfe, and all the creatures in heaven &amp; earth. God hath delivered us from the evill of all evils, and hath given us the bleſsing of all bleſsings, the marrow of all comforts; the earth is ours, the heavens ours, the word ours, the ſpirit ours, God ours becauſe Chriſt is ours. Now then when in Chriſt our head wee are eſtated in the whole world, have we not matter of thankfulneſſe? yes (we now ſee it) if we had hearts.</p>
            <p>But how ſhal's get a thankefull heart firſt, <note place="margin">Ob.</note> and expreſſe it next?</p>
            <p>Labour for three ſaving graces; 1. Humility; <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> 2. Faith; 3. Love. All theſe ſend a man abroad, and make him ſeeke himſelfe in others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Humilitie empties a man of all great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the creature, and fills him with an high admiration of the Creator. The humble man ſo well underſtands himſelfe, and other creatures, and Gods excellencie, that he ſees that too much cannot be aſcribed to God, too little to man: and therfore he is very willing that God ſhould carry all the praiſe and glorie from all creatures; and the more hee can abaſe fleſh and exalt God, the more glad he is. Labour then to be humble men with <hi>Iacob</hi> and you wil findy our ſelves leffe than the leaſt favour, then you will ſee; <note place="margin">V. Bradford.</note> matter of thankfulneſſe there, where the proude finds mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of murmuring.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Faith is another emptying vertue: it layes up all its treaſure in anothers houſe, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21381:13"/>leaves it in anothers hands for feare of robbing. The faithfull mans treaſure is Chriſt, his life is Chriſt his crowne and glorie is Chriſt: if Chriſt hath, honour, he hath honour enough; therefore he willingly carries all to Chriſt. Labour then for faith: for if faith once unite you to Chriſt, that you be one, and unite you to God through Chriſt, that you can look upon God as your God, then you will ſeeke his honour as your owne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, love ſeekes not its owne (eyther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite or credite) it liwes in another, and it works for another: in that meaſure that wee love God, wee will ſeeke Gods glory, we will ſpeake good of his name, <note place="margin">Amas &amp; lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das. in Pſ. <hi>85.</hi> ſic &amp; Chryſ. ad pop.

               </note> and ſet out his praiſes. O love him who is love beautie, nay glorie inſelfe: and if thou love, thou praiſeſt, as <hi>Auſben</hi> ſpeakes.</p>
            <p>Thus the heart will be tuned and ſet right, if it be a broken heart, abeleeving heart, a nealous heart, twill endite well, praiſes wil ſtreame from it as naturally as water from a fountaine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.1. but then (in the next place) the outward man muſt concurre, the tongue muſt walke apace like a ſwiſt pen; to that end, do but owne thine owne words, firſt, tabe up the complaints thou madeſt in thine afflictions, he as eloquent in enlarging thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes now paſt, as thou waſt then; ſpeake now what paines, ſeanes, griefes, ſomes God hath now delivered thee from, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> doth here: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thy then ſomewes to preſent thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, that our thankes muſt in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure anſwer Gods mercy, and our former miſery; the more our ſighes were, the more our ſongs muſt be; the more prayers were made, the more praiſes muſt follow (for thoſe bee double mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that follow upon prayer). and next for God, the more remarkeable the deliverance was, the more ſolemn and heartie the thankſgiving muſt be, for ſingular mencies we muſt doe ſome ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larthing, ſet apart ſome time, ſome Preſent, ſome gift, doe ſome thing that may ſcale up our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt acknowledgement of Gods goodneſſe, elſe great mercies will work great thoughts, as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> found for a time, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25.</p>

            <p>Which three queſtions ſhal receive theſe three ſhort anſwers following.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 The writing is Poeticall, and delivered in Verſe, for the helpe both of memorie and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</item>
               <item>2 For the Penman, we cannot ſay much of certaintie, nor is it much materiall; this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> made cyther the deſcant or plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſong. 2. the Worthies of God, <hi>Iob, David, Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> &amp;c. were much delighted with Poetry. 3. the Kings of Iudah (ſundry of them) were endued with an extraordinarie ſpirit, &amp; a divine ſentence was often in their mouthes, as wee ſee in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and ſpeeches, and praiers of divers of them: wherefore if wee ſay that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> pend this with his own hand, we ſay more than what ſeems reaſonable in it ſelfe, and probable to others.

            </list>
            <p>For the third queſtion, the good Kings mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was to conſecrate (with this ſong) himſelfe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21381:14"/>and his life to God, and to leave this upon record as a pledge and proofe of his thankfulneſſe to all poſteritie.</p>
            <p>In his practiſe, take notice of our duetie.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt adde to our preſent thankeſgivings ſome pawne and monument of our thankfulneſſe for the future. <note place="margin">Doct. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> We muſt, for great bleſsings, ſtake downe preſent thankes: that's one duetie, but that's not all; wee muſt leave ſome monument therof (as we may) to poſteritie, and caſt how we may eternize Gods praiſes, and procure him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in ſurviving ages.</p>
            <p>This (firſt) God commands; <hi>Tell it</hi> (ſaith hee, when he ſpeakes of great mercies) <hi>to thy childrens children.i.e.</hi> convey thankefulneſſe to poſteritie, and keep on foot Gods praiſes to the worlds end, if poſsible. Hereof is it, that the Lord ſets a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Accent upon ſpeciall mercies, and takes order that they may bee reported to ſucceſsion. Thus when he had ſet Iſraell over Iordan, and in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of his countrey, <hi>Set up</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>ſtones,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioſh. 4.7, 8, 9.</note> ſome in the water, ſome on the land, that may witneſſe my mercie, your thankfulneſſe, for after times; let the very place ſpeake it. And elſewhere, Day unto day (as here place to place) muſt utter his goodneſſe and mans gratitude. Hence thoſe ſolemnities of the Paſſe-over for one mercie, <note place="margin">Levit. 23</note> of Pentecoſt for another, of Tabernacles for a third, of Trumpets for a fourth, of new Moones for a firſt, &amp;c. God for great mercies would have a commemoration, a day of publicke thankſgiving throughout all generations.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:21381:15"/>
            <p>Secondly, as God commanded, ſo his people practiſed this duetie; ſometimes they ſet out time, <note place="margin">Eſt. 9.</note> as in the feaſt of Purim; ſometimes they ſet up Altars, as <hi>Abraham</hi> often; ſometimes they leave a marke upon the place, <note place="margin">2.

            <p n="2">2 When thou haſt done ſo, caſt thine eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Indah</hi> with him; looke abroad, and ſee how preſent wants threaten poſterity with miſerie, and as thou canſt prevent it: I. ſee how manie grown ones there be that play, or ſteale, or beg for want of imployment, and ſet thy wits on work to finde out ſome trade, ſome husbandry, ſome buſineſſe that may give ſome imployment. 2. ſee how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie little ones there be that mought be uſefull if they had breeding; but alas their parents (if li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) have neyther meanes to breed them Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, nor money to binde them apprentices: call upon thy ſelfe and others, ſaying, There's a wittie childe, lets breed him a Scholar; there's a ſtrong childe, lets traine him up for a Souldier, make him an apprentice, &amp;c. who knowes what ſervice hee may doe the Church or Countrey oneday: O what good mought rich men doe this way if they had hearts! If they feare to erect publique ſtanding Schooles or Colledges, or to give ſome Fellowſhips for perpetuitie, let them (if they minde the common good) take ſome particular children that are moſt hopefull, and breed them,

            <p n="2">2 Bee, with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> a good Churchman; 1. repaire Gods houſe, &amp; let it never be ſaid, that our Churches lye like Barnes, and that <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> lets downe what <hi>Pater noster</hi> ſet up. 2.

What? expect Sermons, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sermons; learning, much learning (ſo that our Preacher muſt be able to anſwer any queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and yet denie him meanes! Meanes? by all meanes we would have him have a competencie. A competencie; how much is that? who ſhall judge of that? Now the good Lord keepe his Clergie from the vulgars competencie. I ſpeake what I know, and I ſpeake it with a wet face and a bleeding heart, I know Preachers of excellent parts, that ſpend their ſtrength in the Pulpit, who cannot lay out ſiſtie ſhillings in ſive yeares upon books, but they muſt fetch it either off the backs, or out of the bellies of their poore children. Call you this a competencie? Well, if wee deſerve no kindneſſe, yet doe us juſtice, lets have what your fathers gave us. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> found things alienated and turned out of courſe; no doubt wits were working then: Take heed (Sir) of Innovations, of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21381:19"/>making your Clergie too rich; the State hath thought fit to leſſen their meanes: men can now preſcribe againſt them, we can ſhew a compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and prove our cuſtome, &amp;c. But what anſwers this good King? Cuſtome mee no cuſtome, wee muſt not make a cuſtome of robbing God. Were theſe things once Gods? eyther ſhew mee Gods releaſe, or elſe reſtore them home.

Do not turne off all with a Tuſh, Tythes were Leviticall, the Goſpel ſpeakes nothing of a Tenth, &amp;c. 1. anſwer what's written; 2. ſhew us where the old appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is reverſed, and which is that <hi>quote pars</hi> now that conſcience muſt reſt in, and when thats done, then give us a juſt Commentary upon that, <note place="margin">V.

And when you have reduced and reſolved all into a competencie, yet let it be S. <hi>Pauls</hi> competencie, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note>

I ſpeake no more than what everie Scholar, who is acquainted with a courſe of ſtudie &amp; reading, knowes to be true: all that meanes which uſually is thought ſufficient to defray all charges, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all payments, to anſwer all expectations of wife and children for portions, of ſtrangers for hoſpitalitie, is little enough to buy a conſtant Preacher bookes, and phyſicke. Now then, if you will be competent arbitrators, allow him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, ſome bread, ſome clothes, ſomething to keepe his wife and children from begging or ſtarving.</p>
            <p>You are wearie (I dare ſay) of this diſcourſe, I have now done, I have diſcharged my conſcience in delivering my errand, &amp; have ſhewed you how you may witneſs your thankfulneſs to ſucceeding times, if you pleaſe. There's firſt, your owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and poſteritie to bee moulded; ſecondly, there be poore Orphans and children to be bred, Schooles to be erected, poore Students in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſitie to be maintained, poor Preachers to be encouraged, Church livings to be redeemed and augmented: and if this be not ſufficient, there be poore Labourers to be imployed, poore debtors to be relieved, yongue Tradeſmen to be credited;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21381:20"/>and if this doe not like you, there be in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, fields to be trenched, woods to be planted, high-wayes to be amended, correction-houſes to be builded, publique ſtore-houſes and Granaries to be appointed, youths and ſouldiers to be tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and in the Cities, waters to bee conveyed, fire-engins to bee invented, &amp;c. And in both, Churches to be repaired, priſons to be furniſhed with ſome Teachers, and other imployments more than a few: ſtand not idle now all the day long, becauſe none ſets you on worke; Houſe, Towne, Field, Countrey, Citie, Church, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, Men, Women, Children, Tradeſmen, Church-men, blinde, lame, poore, all call upon you to worke: nay, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>whileſt its day worke;</hi> the Spirit ſaith, <hi>whileſt you have time, doe good;</hi> your Father ſaith, <hi>Give to ſeven and eight, be not weary in well-doing;</hi> your labour is not loſt, your coſt is not loſt, God will pay you all againe, honour him he will honour you, bleſſe him hee will bleſſe you, giue him immortall praiſe, and you ſhall receive an immortall Crowne.</p>
            <p>We have heard, firſt, that King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was thankefull; ſecondly, that hee was thankefull to purpoſe: Now lets ſee for what hee is ſo thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; 1. that his ſickneſſe was removed; 2. that his health was reſtored. Wee will ſhut up both in one.</p>
            <p>Freedome from ſickneſſe, <note place="margin">Doct.</note> enjoyment of health, are two mercies which call for manie thankes. Need we prove this? Firſt for ſickeneſſe, we have the voyce of God and man, that it is amercie to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21381:20"/>eſcape it; 1. God promiſes freedome from it, <note place="margin">Exod. 15.26. Lev. 26.16. Deut. 28.22.</note> as a bleſsing upon the obedient; 2. Hee threatens the inflicting of it as a judgement upon the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and accordingly proceeds.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all men be of the ſame minde; firſt, good men wil bleſſe God for an Eagle-like-body, <note place="margin">Thence called <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> a bodie full of ſtrength and life, of action and motion like the Eagles, which is moſt laſting <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103. Secondly, naturall men ranke this in the forefront of mercies, yea reckon of health as an abridgement of <hi>all bleſſings, and of ſickeneſſe as</hi> the ſumme of all outward miſeries. And that not-altogether without reaſon.</p>
            <p>For firſt, ſickneſſe muſt be numbred amidſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall evils: how ſoever it will ſtand with univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall nature, and the all wife God can improve it to ſingular uſe, yet in it ſelfe, it muſt be deemed evill in its nature, being againſt the private welfare of the patient; evill in its cauſe, mans ſinne; evill in its terme and iſſue, it tends to death; evill in its effects, it adds to our miſerie: whereas ſome evils wound with ſorrow, ſome threaten us with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, this doth both.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it maimes nature, and hinders good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; the bodie is deprived of cheerfulneſſe and activitie, <note place="margin">Malum contriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum quae vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntati, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Galen.</note> the ſoule diſappointed, like the Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler that rides a tyred horſe, it can neither receive that good, nor doe that good that otherwiſe it could. There's no man knowes, but he that knows fickneſſe, what a diſadvantage tis to the ſoule to be ill lodged in a ruinous bodie: Its even ſtifled within it ſelfe for want of motion, and move it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21381:21"/>cannot for want of organs, but verie lamely: The underſtanding is clouded, memorie weakned, judgement dazled, phantaſie diſturbed, affections diſtempered, in ſhort, the whole frame of Nature ſo diſ-jointed, that like broken bones it can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſt nor move. Nor is the ſtroke only upon naturall actions, but upon morall alſo; the ſoule in diſeaſes chronicall becomes ſo lazie, liſtleſſe, neutrall, that it hath no mind to pray, no ſtomach to food, no heart to doe any thing for it ſelfe; and in diſeaſes more acute is ſo taken up and tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with paine &amp; anguiſh, that it mindes nothing but what cannot be had, ſleep and eaſe, &amp;c. Hence we may put that difference betweene ſicke and ſound that the Heathen put betweene poore and rich; <note place="margin">ciog.</note> the healthfull man may ſtudie when hee will, walke when he will, eate when he will, ſleepe when he will, worke, play, faſt, feaſt, ride, runne when hee will: but the ſickly man muſt ſtudie, preach, travell, eate, ſleepe when he can; he is not his owne so command: hee hath not himſelfe, much leſſe other comforts. No marvell if ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at one blow deprive us of the comfort of our meats, beds, houſes, grounds, friends, wife, children, &amp;c. it deprives a man of himſelfe: hee hath wit, but not uſe of it; memorie, but not the benefite of it: yea it turnes him well-moſt into an Image; he hath eyes, and ſcarcely ſees; eares, and heares not; mouth, and ſpeakes not; feet, but walkes not: nay yet further, thoſe ſenſes &amp; parts which let in comfort to the ſound, occaſion the ſick mans trouble, the ſight of his cupps, glaſſes,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21381:21"/>boxes makes him ſicke, the ſmell of his meates ſicke, the taſte of his drinkes ſicke, the leaſt noyſe offends him, the leaſt ayre pierces him, in a word, this turnes his comforts into croſſes, his bed tyres him, his chaire troubles him, his friends diſquiet him, their abſence offends him, and ſo doth their preſence, their <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ence offends, and ſo doth their talke, their mirth doth, and ſo doth their ſadneſſe: poore man, ſomewhat he would have, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what; hee is not well, and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is well about him; he is ſicke, and ſo all the world is made of ſickeneſſe to him, as to the gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die all things run round.</p>
            <p>Now as ſickeneſſe is a great affliction, ſo health as great a mercie: it comes from mercy, <note place="margin">Hence called in Hebr. length. on.</note> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes manie bleſſings; good temper, good ayre, (at leaſt for us) good food, at leaſt a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bleſsing upon poore meanes. 2. It tends to mercie, health tends to life (the greateſt bleſſing) to a long life, yea immortalitie ſo farre as that goes. 3. It carries with it a troupe of mercies, 1. it ſweetens all other croſſes and wants; health ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thin coats warme, hard fare ſweete, a meane lodging good, tis the poore mans ſawce at's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his cloke in his journcy, his warming-pan in his bedde, his boots in the myre, and when he is at worſt he can leape and ſay, as the countrey phraſe is, Health is worth all. 2. It puts him into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all other bleſsings: 1. Hee enjoyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, his wits, ſenſes, limbs be his owne, hee hath their uſe and ſervice. 2. with himſelfe he enjoyes all things about him; the light is pleaſant, the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21381:22"/>ayre ſweete, his meate good, drinke good, bedde good, now all that was naught before becomes good. Againe, he reliſhes all, hee findes content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all: now he ſees a wife to be a wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be children, friends to be friends, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before all the world was made of his humour, whether bitter or ſowre.

The ſecond is pride, a ſinne that ſo ſwels the ſoule that it breaks the skin and caſe, the body: pride breakes the wits, witneſſe <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> breakes the heart, and wounds it ſelfe, witneſſe <hi>Saul, Achitophol,</hi> and breakes ones ſleepe, ones peace, bodie, eſtate, all; a ſick diſeaſe: a proude man is never without ſome ailement.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21381:23"/>Proverbs: there you may reade of the Countrey mans three Doctors, Quiet, Diet, Mirth. For the firſt, health is nothing but Natures reſt &amp; repoſe; health gives peace, and peace yeelds health: out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace is a great bleſing, and verie whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but that comes from peace within; which is double, 1. peace of Iuſtification, 2. peace of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. So long as there's warre in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, warre in the affections, one power and luſt conflicting with another, alas there's no more quiet to us than was of old to <hi>Rebecca:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 26.</note> but when Faith heales the conſcience, and Grace huſhes the affections, &amp; compoſes all within, then the ſoule lookes out of the bodie, and ſits in the face with a checrefull countenance. If your fleſh, with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi> ſhall rejoyce, labour for this peace; get faith in Chriſts bloud, get the vertue of Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, get wiſedome, i. all ſaving grace, and that makes for health, and is a medicine, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.8.</p>

            <p>Brethren, if you have not felt ſickeneſſe, yet heare it, view it ſee how it racks and tortures a poore man, and that done, reflect upon thy ſelfe and ſay, O Lord how much am I bound to thee for health! I can eate, my brother cannot; I can walke, he cannot; I ſleep all night, he never layes his eyes together; O Lord give mee a mercifull heart to men, a thankefull heart to thee for this bleſsing:</p>
            <p>For the ſecond ſort; have we beene ſicke and now made ſound? lay both eſtates together with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and provoke thy ſelfe to thankfulneſſe. Call to mind what then thine anguiſh was, how ſicke thy ſtomach was, how ſad thy friends were, how tedious the night, how long the day, how terrible the thoughts of death, the apprehenſion of judgement: thinke now thy thoughts then, acknowledge now thy then purpoſes and vowes. Didſt thou not then thinke, and promiſe, Oh if God would reprieve mee once more, I would become a new man, more carefull of my wayes, more thankfull for health than ever I have beene: thinke now what the price of health was then, what then thou wouldſt have given for one nights ſleep, one hours eaſe, one draught of drink, one vomit, one ſtoole, one the leaſt of thoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which now thou enjoyeſt: thinke how little wealth, houſe, land, friends, all ſeemed to thee without health, and now thou haſt all reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in this, lift up thine eyes and hands to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21381:24"/>with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and ſay, Sickneſſe put me out of poſſeſsion of all, but with health all is come back againe; my ſtomach is come to mee, my ſleepe, my fleſh, my ſtrength, my joy, my friends, my houſe, my wealth, all is returned: O what a change is here! earſt nothing but pain, now nothing but eaſe; not long ſince ſtript of all, now poſſeſſed of all, as if I were another <hi>Iob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, would wee looke eyther downeward or backward, wee ſhould become more thankefull; but in any caſe take that with you which is ſaid before of thankefulneſſe in generall, and apply it to this particular of health. <note place="margin">Nibil prodest verbis praeſerre virtutem, factis destruere zeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem.

            <p n="1">1 Come forth of affliction as <hi>Iob</hi> did, that is, as the gold comes out of the fire, purged from your droſſe: let ſickneſſe draine the ſoule as well as bodie, and leave your humours, your pride; ſelfe-love, worldlineſſe, hypocriſie, &amp;c. weaker than it found them: and now you be made whole, take your Saviours <hi>Item, Sinne no more, <note place="margin">Iob. 5.14.</note> leſt a worſe thing happen to you;</hi> fall not to your olde dyet, leſt you fall into your old diſeaſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe.

            <p>Nor is it ſufficient to preſent the Lord once, and to confine our thankefulneſſe to anie one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance; we muſt, in the third place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate our ſtrengths and lives to God, and offer up our ſelves as living and acceptable ſacrifices to him <note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> that is, woe muſt uſe all our time, all our wit, all our health, <note place="margin">Opus nostrum Pſalterium no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum eſt.

If thou wilt heare me, Ile deliver it to thee with the ſame affection (degrees excepted) that <hi>Eltha</hi> did to <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 34.31.32.</p>
            <p>Surely it is meete, <note place="margin">Iob 34.31.</note> and it becomes thee to ſay, and that to God, I have borne chaſtiſement; this the firſt leſſon. Farre be it from thee to ſay in thy heart, Tis true, I have buried manie children, but what were they? of the baſer &amp; poorer ſort, ſuch, whoſe lives were burden ſome, whoſe deaths are beneficiall to me: nor let it enter into thy heart to thinke, Well, I ſee the error; had ſuch a place beene ſcoured, ſuch traffique ſtayed, ſuch meanes uſed, this had beene prevented, hereafter Ile bee wiſer. No, it is thy wiſe dome to ſee Gods Name written upon this rod, as <hi>Micah</hi> ſpeakes, and to acknowledge him: we wiſh thee to uſe all ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary meanes, but not to reſt there; thy experience hath taught thee, that the plague nothing feares, either thy new fields, or freſh waters, &amp;c: it comes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21381:27"/>of Gods errand, and when it comes, take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, for it wil not away without its errand. Therefore in the ſecond place, improve the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as well as feele it; proceed to the ſecond leſſon in <hi>Iob,</hi> and ſay, Ile ſinne no more. Firſt, <note place="margin">Iob 5.6.</note> ſee why the rod is ſent as well as by who. The rod buds not out of the duſt, it hath a roote, and that root is ſinne, and that ſinne is manifold. A King doth not uſe to ſmite downe his ſubjects by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands for ſmall offences; a father will not draw a ſword upon his children for toyes and trifles: London, thou muſt take the height of thy ſinnes by the compaſſe of the puniſhment, and judge of that by this.</p>
            <p>What I have thought of thee, and thy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in generall, I have ſpoken elſewhere ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably enough, as I think; but now I ſpeak to thee, I earneſtly entreate thee to take into thy conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. and therein note how the Lord charges her not only with ſuch crimes as were committed by her, but alſo in her, <hi>In thee,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>were they, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21381:28"/>own wayes, caſt into the account thine-other-mens-ſinnes, thine-other-land ſinnes, thy Dutch ſinnes, thy French ſinnes, thy Spaniſh ſinnes, thy Italian ſinnes, thine-owne-countrey-ſinnes; ſee whether there be not in thee thoſe that eate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mountaines, and thoſe that for lucre ſake both harbour and hide them. Whether in thee there be not ſuch as never yet ſaw Chriſts face, or heard his voyce in the Aſſemblies: whether in this wonderful light, there be not in thee who know not whether Chriſt be a man or woman: whether there be not in thee men, who ſtudy new oathes and lyes, as men doc new faſhions: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thee there be not who never ſee the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath light, but lye eyther buried in bed, or drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in drinke: whether in thee children be not ſo wantonly bred, that they ſleight father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, to make ſhort of a long bed-roll; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thee there be not wretched men that ſet open their doores to all the bankrupts, unthrifts, gameſters, robbers, cheaters, harlots that the countrey purſues: whether in thee there be not ſome that ſet all to ſale, wife, childe, ſervant, name, conſcience, ſoule, all. And if upon ſearch theſe or any of theſe ſhall bee found within thy walls or reach, O gloriſie God in his viſitation, and ſave thy ſelfe by diſclayming theſe ſinnes. Thine they be not, if thou where thou mayeſt doſt reforme them, and where thy power fayles doſt bewaile them. Howbeit this is not all; as ſinne muſt be ſeene, ſo muſt it be left: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou muſt proceed, <note place="margin">Iob 34.31.</note> and ſay, Ile offend no
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21381:28"/>more: as a Chriſtian, Ile reforme my ſelfe; as a parent, my children; as a Maſter, my family; as a Magiſtrate, my charge; as a tradſman, my courſes. And to the end thy reformation may be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, learne two things more of <hi>Elihu,</hi> firſt, <note place="margin">Verſ. 32</note> be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſee and know thy faults; pray that GOD would adde to correction inſtruction, that he will open thine heart to heare, and ſome mouth to ſpeake home to thy caſe, thy ſoule; <note place="margin">Pſal. 94.12.</note> and when light is commin, winke not with thine eyes, ſhut not the doore againſt it. Secondly, carrie ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee this reſolution, Let God teach, Ile learne; ſpeake, Ile heare; convince me of a ſinne, Ile leave it whatever becomes of me; be it my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, be it to me as my life, if God will ſay it is a ſinne, Ile leave it in the practiſe, in the purpoſe, in the allowance of it; this murtherous ſinne that hath ſlaine my childe, my friend, ſo manie of my neighbours, nay my Saviour, ſhall never have place againe in my heart or houſe. And this is not onely the way to thankefulneſſe, but alſo a proofe and peece of it: know that ſo many ſinnes as the love of God conſtraines us to leave, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſongs are preſented to God; <note place="margin">Chryſ. de laude Dei.</note> everie ſlaine luſt is a gratulatorie ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, thou muſt proceed with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and ſee from what, to what God hath brought thee: ſhall a Citie conceive and bring forth in a day? it hath beene ſo with thee. I may ſay of thy ſorrowes, what <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes of his comforts, they have beene ſwifter than a ſhuttle: <note place="margin">Iob 7.</note> Didſt thou or anie man living thinke, that within one Summer
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21381:29"/>thou ſhouldeſt burie ſo manie, and ſo few weeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? could it be imagined, that when thy channels were diſcovered in ſo low an ebbe, that thy banks ſhould be ſo ſuddenly filled againe? O London looke upon thy ſelfe, and wonder at thy ſelfe: invert now <hi>Ieremies</hi> lamentation, and ſay, How is the ſolitarie Citie become full! how is ſhee that was barren, made fruitfull! Sit downe with <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">See the plague at Aſex in Cypr. &amp; Euſ</note> and conſider what thy bitterneſſe was when death walkt in the ſtreets, raged in the chambers, when death was in the pot, in the bedde, in the diſh, in the hall, in the parlour, when the bells ſpake nothing but death, the doores preſented no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death, and every man thou ſaweſt, thing thou touchedſt, place thou ſateſt in threatned thee with death: conſider what thy cares, fears, griefs, thoughts were then; and now whileſt thine eyes behold as it were a reſurrection to life, ſo that now life is in the ſtreetes, life in the houſe, life in the Church, trading, building, ſinging, &amp;c. alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, bleſſe thy GOD that hath wrought this change, and get up with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to the houſe of the Lord: Strange it was, that hee in ſo ſhort a ſpace ſhould meaſure the whole diſtance betwixt death and life; yeſterday dead in nature, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to live as the ſunne to goe backward, and to morrow ſo ſtrong that he could ſhew himſelfe in the Lords courts: This is wonderfull, and this made him wondrous thankfull. And what (I pray) wants thy deliverance of this? how much leſſe wonderfull? how faſt did ſickneſſe come in, how faſt did it gallop out? how faſt did it riſe from
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21381:29"/>ſcores to thouſands, how faſt did it fall againe from thouſands to ſcores? London, lay theſe things together, and forget not him who hath done ſo great things for thee.</p>
            <p>In the third place, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> loves not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch all at one journey: hee begins his ſong aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as mought be, but tis not ended yet; he hath left a patterne for thee to work by. Thinke it not ſufficient to complement God with a few words, and a ſhort ſong, for along deliverance; write this mercy with a pen of Diamond, in a book of Marble; call upon all within thee, <note place="margin">Pſal. 103.1.</note> as <hi>David</hi> did within him, to ſpeake of this deliverance to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens children, and doe ſomething that may ſet men on ſinging 500. yeares hence: Thou haſt ſonnes of all ſorts; ſome Enginers, ſome Artiſts, ſome Poets, ſome of excellent invention, ſome of great activity, ſome very daring and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, ſome ſtrong, ſome wiſe, ſome rich, of all ranks ſome; call upon them, ſome to write, ſome to build, ſome to invent, ſome to give, that cirie, country, Church, State, ſea and land may take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thence of bleſſing God, whilſt London or England ſtands. Now happy <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſickneſſe of his that ended ſo well: his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſent him to God with prayers, his recovery with praiſes; nor God nor man loſt by this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: God had more ſervice, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, we gaine a good coppy, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> hath his leaſe renewed for fifteene yeares: And thus afflictions conclude, which begin with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and end in thankfulneſſe. London, make thy
