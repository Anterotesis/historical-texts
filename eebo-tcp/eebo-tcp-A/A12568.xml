            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

first association of men dispersed, from a
solitary sauage life, into Citties, Common

militarie.</p>
            <p>Religion saith <hi>Plato,</hi> is the foundation of al Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealths,
and of humane societie; execution of good lawes, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Iustice, (which is rightly to be called pollicie) is the
fountaine of felicitie: And the exercise of Armes and of
the Art and discipline militarie, is the maintainer of peace,
and ground of securitie; without these and euery one of these,
no kingdome can continue, and the Common wealth where
they are with good order established, doth prosper and flourish:
For ouerpassing the commoditie and necessitie of Religion and
pollicie, to be dilated of by Diuines and states-men, as more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to their profession, and impertinent to my present
purpose: Concerning the Art and science Militarie, this may
I boldly &amp; trulie write and affirme: that by the exercise ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
all Empires, kingdomes, and Common wealthes haue come
to their height and soueraintie, and haue maintained their
happy state and prosperitie; And by neglecting the same,
they haue declined, decaied, and finally been made praies to
their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The Art Militarie it was, that established the Empires
<pb facs="tcp:11434:3"/>
of the <hi>Egyptians, Assirians, Medes, Persians, &amp; Grecians;</hi>
and that inlarged the dominions of the <hi>Romains</hi> to so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
greatnesse: This Art it was, by the which great <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

thereof againe, hath beene the decay and ruine both of
those and many other most noble Empires and Kingdomes, and
hath caused the losse of all Greece, and a great part of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

               </note> By men of
Warre (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) Common wealths are conserued, and
that the Art Militarie should be alwaies practised in any well
ordered kingdome, it is both profitable and necessarie: which
<hi>Gelon</hi> king of <hi>Scicilie</hi> wel knowing and considering, &amp; that
people vnpractised in Armes through idlenesse and want of
experience incur danger to be subdued: He caused often in his
kingdome rumors of warres, and inuasions of Enemies to bee
raised, and therevpon made present preparation of resistance,
leuied souldiors, trained and exercised them in al points of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie
discipline, and led them foorth in warlike order some
certen daies march, towards the sea coast, as though hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
presentlie to giue battle to his enemies inuauding;
but his souldiors expecting the enemies, and when they should
fight, he emploied them in certaine labors and trauailes, such
as he thought conuenient, saying, that in performing the same,
they should both ouercome sloth and Idlenesse, two mortal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the common wealth; and that their enemies besides,
vnderstanding how they were void of Idlenesse, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Armes, would neuer haue the boldnesse to inuade them.</p>
            <p>The like prouident care haue diuers other noble kings, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors

into skirmish &amp; to giue battle with the most aduantage, which
of al other matters military are of greatest importance, to work

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first thing belonging to the Art
and Science Militarie, practised by all
Warlike Nations in all ages hath bin,
that al Captains after they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the charge of bands or companies
of horsmen or footmen armed &amp; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned,
according to the discipline and
vse of the Nation that they are of; haue first instructed
and taught their souldiors to reduce themselues into their
simple and single order of ranks, and to weare, carry, and
vse all their weapons in soldior-like manner, according
to the nature and effect of euery different sort of them,
without which readilie and orderlie performed and dulie
obserued, with all obedience, neyther Captains, officers,
nor their soldiors, can in right vnderstanding be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
worthy to beare the name of men of warre; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will first begin with the orderlie reducing of a band
into forme to march in their rankes as followeth.</p>
            <p>All Captaines, Lieutenants, and Sergeants of bands,
are first to consider before they do reduce their bands of
souldiors into their simple and single order of ranks,<note place="margin">Certen mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of and obserued by all Captaines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their bands into their simple &amp; single order of rankes.</note> how
many different sorts of weapons they haue in their bands
with the number of euery different sort of weapon; which
done, then are they to consider what sort &amp; kind of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
shall march in the first compertiment or deuision,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11434:7"/>
and what other sort of weapon in the second comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so subsequentlie in all the rest; so as alwaies the
compertiment of armed men piquers doo march in the
midst of all the rest of the compertiments.</p>
            <p>All which being by them and their officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,<note place="margin">A comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a band of Soldiors, is to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of soldiors of any one sort of weapon, as of Harquebuzi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers, of archers, of musquetiers, of piquers or of halbardiers, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duced into their simple or single order of rankes, as of 3. 4. 5. 6. or 7. &amp; so vppe to 10. or 11. in a rank at the most, readie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into squadron, or to be any other waies imploied</note>
then they are to resolue how many souldiers
of euery sort of weapon they will command to march in
a rancke; as of 5. of 6. or of 7. or more or fewer: so as
they be not fewer then 3. nor more then 10. or 11: at the
most in their simple and single order of rankes, although
their bandes be verie great. And these numbers of 10. or
11. in a ranke at the most, and 3. soldiors in a ranke at the
fewest for single bands to march in, hath beene obserued
by all men of warre of iudgement amongst all Warlike
Nations in all ages; and that in respect that the rankes of
souldiors that doe not exceed the number of 10. or 11.
may in an instant bee numbred by the Captaines or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
sudden casting their eies vpon such ranks, as also by
the souldiors that are to reduce themselues into their
rankes: wheras if they were of greater numbers, the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
lieutenant, or sergeants, may quicklie mistake the
number of soldiors in ranke, and so to their reproach faile
in their intended reducements. Besides that squadrons
how great, and of what forme soeuer they are formed, the
compertiments of diuers or many bands, are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently
and certeinlie brought into their proportions
and formes,<note place="margin">Single bandes are not to march aboue 10. or 11. in a ranke at the most for diuers causes and reaso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not exceed the number of 10. or 11. in a ranke at the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost,
or rather fewer, then if they were of greater
numbers; with other causes and reasons also which for
breuities sake in this place I omit. And now all this bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as aforesaid by a Captaine considered, and he hauing
with himselfe concluded that all the compertiments of
different weapons throughout his band shall march 5. in
a rank, or any other number (as aforesaid:) he is presently
to giue order to his officers to reduce them into that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11434:7"/>
number in euerie ranke; which to performe, some one of
them is first to saie vnto the harquebuziers who are to be
the first compertiment,<note place="margin">Certen orders and briefe spea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued &amp; vsed by Captains &amp; their officers, when they would reduce their bandes into their sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and single order of ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes.</note> 
               <hi>Ranke your selues harquebuziers
fiue in a ranke,</hi> appointing them the ground where the
soldiors of the first ranke shall reduce themselues; and so
likewise the like briefe wordes and orders are to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
to the Archers, to the Musquetiers, and to the
armed men: which being by them heard, euery different
sort of those weapons ought with all celeritie to reduce
themselues throughout their compertiments into the
foresaid number of 5. in a ranke,<note place="margin">In all reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes either of horsemen or footmen al the backer rankes must obserue the proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate distances in frunt and by flanks, of the two formost rankes.</note> all the backer rankes of
euery compertiment, obseruing the proportionate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the two first rankes of their owne comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in frunt and by flanks.</p>
            <p>But because when soldiors doo begin to reduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
into ranks after the number pronounced by their
Captains or Sergeants, that in the first, second, or third
ranke, or else in some of the rest of the rankes, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
sometimes more soldiors to fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l into some of those
rankes, then there should be by the number pronounced,
(as aforesaid) and that those soldiors that came last into
that ranke or those ranks,<note place="margin">Two speciall &amp; generall rules to be obserued by all soldiors when they are to reduce them selues into rankes.</note> are vpon pride or wilfulnesse
lothe to put themselues out of that ranke or rankes, and
to retire themselues to find out some ranke or ranks that
doe lacke the number pronounced: the Captains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and the officers of bands ought to instruct their sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors,
at such times as they are to reduce themselues into
their simple or single order of rankes, according vnto the
number by their Captains or officers pronounced, that
if in the first, second, or third ranke; or in any of the rest
of the former ranks, that disorder doe happen; that then
the ouerplus of the number of the soldiors by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
or officers pronounced that doe find themselues on
the left flanke, or side of that ranke, or rankes, shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
put themselues out of the same ranke, or ranks, and
retire vntill they find a ranke or rankes, that doe lacke the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11434:8"/>
number of soldiors by their Captain or officers pronoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced.
And to the intent that this order may be the better
performed, the Captaines, Lieutenants, and sergeants,
ought to instruct their soldiors that in the reducing of
themselues into ranks, the first soldior that is to begin in
the first ranke, being placed by the Sergeant in the place
where the first ranke should begin, the rest of the soldiors
of the same armor and weapon that are next vnto that
first soldior by the seargeant placed, shall presently fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ranke by the left side or flanke the one of th' other, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
that ranke be compleat according to the number by
the Captain, Lieutenant, or Sergeant pronounced. And
so likewise the second,<note place="margin">This kind of reducement of a single band of horsemen or footmen into rankes, euery soldior by the left flanke of the other hath not bene accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to true discipline vsed by our English nation of a long time.</note> third, fourth, and consequentlie al
the rest of the ranks are to reduce themselues into theyr
ranks by the left flankes, or sides the one of the other, and
not to enter into ranke disorderlie th' one betwixt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So that by the performance of this prescribed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
any ouerplus of soldiors that shall happen to fall into
any of those rankes shall find themselues to be on the left
flanke or side of those ranks, and therfore shall know that
it is their duties presently to retire out of those ranks, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they find some other ranke or rankes that doo lack the
number by their Captains or Sergeants pronounced. Al
which different weapons being reduced into their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiments
by the orders aforesaide, then the Captaine
may command his lieutenant and Sergeants of the band
to draw the one halfe of euery different sort of weapon of
volee, behind the compertiment of armed men, &amp; there
to place them in the same &amp; like order as the other halfe
of those weapons of volee are before the armed men; so
as the armed piquers shall hold the middle place of the
band according to all discipline.</p>
            <p>And the like briefe speeches and prescribed orders of
reducements by the left flanke the one of th'other may
serue for horsmen, be they men at Armes, Launces, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
or Stradiots, or of any other kinde of armor and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11434:8"/>
weapon on horsebacke. As for example, If a Captaine
or Lieutenant of men at Armes, or Dimilances would
reduce his companie into their simple or single order of
rankes,<note place="margin">Briefe spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to be vsed by Captains of horsemen when they are to reduce their companies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their simple and single or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of rankes.</note> he is to say vnto those that are to begin the first
ranke: <hi>Ranke your selues Launces three in a ranke,</hi> or 4 or 5
in a ranke, or as it shal please him: Vpon which speaches
pronounced, all his whole band or companie is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
his commandement and words pronounced with
the like obseruations as are before prescribed vnto the
bands of footmen, hauing alwaies speciall regard to their
proportionate distances in frunt and by flanks. And these
prescribed orders before set downe, al soldiors bee they
horsmen or footmen ought to know &amp; performe with all
celerity, quietnes, &amp; silence, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very seuere punishment.</p>
            <p>Now the Captain or Captains hauing reduced their
soldiors into their simple, or single order of ranks or into
any forme of square, &amp; that the soldiors piquers do stand
at their piques, the butends on the ground, and the points
vpright, and that the Captain, Lieutenant, or Sergeants
would haue them to march, they are then to say to the
first ranke: <hi>Shoulder your piques and march;</hi> which is as
much to say:<note place="margin">Brief speaches to be vsed by the Captain &amp; his officers to piquers stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</note> Lay your piques vpon your right shoulders
and march, which shouldering of piques must be doone
with a comely and soldiorlike grace, all the piquers of the
first ranke falling backe with their right feet almost a foot
behind their left, that their piques may the more leisure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and comelie fall to their shoulders, and then raising vp
their left feet about a handfull from the ground,<note place="margin">How piquers should shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques and march.</note> &amp; letting
them fall againe, they must all in an instant aduance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
&amp; so fal into their march, first with their right feet.
And so in like maner the second, third, and fourth ranks,
&amp; so subsequentlie al the rest of the ranks must in al points
perform the like, &amp; shoulder their pikes one after another
&amp; carry the butends of their piques 3. foot or more from
the ground, straight in discent towardes the right hams
of the souldiors piquers marching before them, euerie
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11434:9"/>
ranke beeing so euen in frunt, that the butend of no pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
pique may preceed the one the other in the same
ranke; and so euen and straight by flanks that the butend
of euerie piquers pique may be iust point and blanke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the right hamme of the piquer preceding in the
ranke before him: And so they must al with great silence
and with a graue and soldiorlike grace, march.</p>
            <p>But whereas in this place I doe instruct that all the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors
of the first ranke, and so subsequentlie of all the rest
of the rankes one after another should first fall back with
their right feet, almost a foot behind their left, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that their piques should fall the more leisurely to
their shoulders, and that then all the soldiors of the first
ranke at one instant should raise and lift vp their left feet
about a handfull from the ground, and letting them fall
againe to the ground should march forward, first with
their right feet; that instruction I doe giue partlie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that the same being orderlie performed as aforsaid,
it dooth giue a very comelie grace vnto the soldiors in
their first beginning to march, but chiefelie because that
the leisurely falling backe of all the soldiors of the first
ranke with their right feet, to shoulder their piques, and
so subsequentlie of all the rest of the rankes one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with the lifting vp also of their left feet about a hand
full from the ground, is a warning to euery hinder ranke
presently to prepare themselues to march, whereas by
not performing the same or the like leisurely and soldior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
warning vpon the stroke of the drum or briefe spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
pronounced as aforesaid, it often commeth to passe
that the soldiors of the second ranke, are suddenlie, and
disorderly cast too great a distance behind the first ranke,
and so consequentlie all the rest of the rankes, by the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
shouldering of their piques, and stepping forward of
the first ranke.</p>
            <p>And I doe further aduertise that the soldiors piquers of
any priuate band marching in their single order of rankes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11434:9"/>
doe in any wise obserue the distances of 16. or else 18.
feet betwixt euerie rank &amp; ranke by flankes, and 6. or else
7.<note place="margin">Distances to be obserued by piquers march<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing in their single order of rankes.</note> feet betwixt euery soldior, and soldior in frunt; that is
betwixt soldior and soldior in euery ranke: And this in
case the ground will permit them or otherwise that they
do march in conuenient distances in frunt and by flanks,
according to the ground and occasion.</p>
            <p>And in this place because I haue mentioned and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the distances that ought to be obserued by a single
band of piquers, and other weapons marching in their
simple and single order of ranks, I thought it were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
place also to handle and write at large of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and different distances that ought to be obserued as
well in frunt; that is in euery ranke from frunt to backe,
as by flanks, that is betwixt euery ranke and ranke, not
only by single bands, but also by squadrons and battels
for many purposes, and that not onelie by footmen, but
also by horsmen of diuers different sortes of armour and
weapons. Howbeit considering that the same hath been
briefelie touched although to no great purpose by some
other writers of forreigne Nations; And that if I should
enter to write and discourse of those matters effectuallie,
it would require manie sheetes of paper, and therefore
would be very long and tedious to the Reader, I thought
good to ouerpasse those particularities as thinges very
well knowne to all skilfull men of warre of all warlike na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to proceed to other matters that doe require
more particular instruction.<note place="margin">That it is a thing of verie great difficulty to set downe by writing all the iust and proportionate distances that Horsemen and footemen are to obserue in frunt and by flanks vpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers occasions.</note> And that the rather, because
the many and different distances that are vppon diuers
different causes and occasions to be obserued by horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
as also by footmen, are such and so many as they
cannot bee expressed by writing but with verie great
difficultie; for that the same cannot bee particularlye
set downe but by the measures of paces and halfe paces,
and by the measures of more and fewer feet, of halfe feet
and quarters of feet, and other such measures; which I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11434:10"/>
thinke no man of any experience can possibly by writing
rightlie expresse without failing or erring more or lesse:
And that by reason that sometimes single bandes are to
march in open places where they haue roome inough to
inlarge their ranks both in frunt and by flankes, thereby
to beautifie and giue grace vnto such companies; And
at other times they are to march thorow Citties and
Townes, where the narrownesse of the streats doe not
giue them roome to inlarge themselues in their distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
thereby to make the greater show: at other times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
bands are to march in the field readie to be reduced &amp;
incorporated with other bands, at which time they are
to march more close, &amp; in neerer distances both in frunt
and by flanks. And so likewise being incorporated into
squadrons, they are for diuers different purposes, as som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for their greater ease to march, &amp; to giue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
show, and to bewtifie the squadron, they are to march
in the rankes inlarged; and at other times vpon the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of the enimie being not yet in sight, or beeing in
sight, they are to straighten their rankes more or lesse; or
that vpon the neare approch of the Enemies squadrons
of both horsmen and footmen, they expect and doubt a
charge of horsmen in frunt, or flankes, or both; or that
they themselues are with their piques to charge a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
squadron of footmen. For al which, and diuers other
occasions and purposes, they are to reforme themselues
into diuers different distances.</p>
            <p>And as piquers and short weapons either in single
bands, or reduced into squadrons, are for diuers purposes
to reforme themselues into such varietie of distances:
Euen so weapons of volee reduced into sleeues, wings,
and other formes, are to vse some of the like, and other
sorts of distances. And as footmen are for such different
causes and occasions to obserue such varietie of distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as aforesaid: Euen so horsmen of diuers armors and
weapons, as men at Armes, Dimilaunces, Stradiots, Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11434:10"/>
and other sorts of light horsemen, are to reduce
themselues into diuers different distances according to
the effects and nature of their armors and weapons; and
are again to reforme themselues into other distances ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to new occasions and directions, sometimes for
one purpose and sometimes for others. All which variety
&amp; different sorts of distances and many others are of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great difficulty, to bee by writing rightly expressed in
their iust and proportionate measures; and yet y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it is a thing of so great facilitie for all good and
diligent Captaines and officers aswell of horsemen as of
footmen, only by sight of eye and ordinarie practise to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
and reduce their souldiors vpon any different occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
into all sorts of distances either in Towne, Campe,
or field, according to the Art and scyence Militarie; as
that there is not any Captaine, Lieutenant, nor Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
of band, that are any waies worthie to haue the
charge or mannaging of a band of footemen; nor any
Captaine, Lieutenant, Conductor, nor Decurion of
horsmen, that are any waies worthy to haue the ordering
&amp; managing of any sorts of horsemen vnder their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
if they doo not very well know all different sortes of
distances according to discipline, that they are to reduce
their soldiors into.</p>
            <p>And if the Captaine or officers aforesaid, would haue
their souldiors to stay their march and make a stand; then
the Captain, Lieutenant, or Sergeant is to say to the first
ranke of piquers <hi>Auance your piques:</hi> which words being
pronounced, al the soldiors piquers,<note place="margin">Brief speaches to be vsed to piquers when they shoulde make a stand or pause.</note> of the first rank must
in an instant lay their left hands vpon the forpart of their
piques, about a foot or more before their right handes,
auancing themselues forward two steps, the first with their
left feet,<note place="margin">How piquers should adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce their piques and make a stand.</note> and the laste steppe with their right feet, and
therewithall raising their piques vpright with both their

with the pointes towards the Element, which being by
the first rank performed with a comly &amp; soldiorlik grace;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11434:11"/>
then the second ranke, the third, fourth &amp; so subsequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all the rest of the ranks one after another, must after the
same sort auance their piques.</p>
            <p>And whereas it hath beene of long time vsed, and stil
is by many Italian, Walloun, and French Captains, and
so likewise by some other Captaines of other Nations,
that they doo instruct their soldiors marching in their
simple or single order of rankes of 5. or 6. or 7. or other
such numbers, as also when they are reduced into squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
that all the piquers that doo march of the left flank
or side of the band or squadron, should carrie all their
piques vpon their left shoulders, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y piquers marching
vpon the right flanke doo carry theirs vpon their right
shoulders; and this to the intent (as they say) that the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
of the left flanke or side of the band or squadron
carrying their piques vpon their left shoulders, doo in the
same carrying of their piques, greatly beautifie the band
or squadron in the eies of the beholders: whereas, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
all the piquers of the left flank should carrie their
piques vpon their right shoulders, as those of the right
flanke doo, that it would not make so good a shew, as by
carrying their piques vpon their left shoulders: Thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I say, that I haue knowne diuers Italians, and namelie
<hi>Marco Antonio Colo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na, Ascanio de la Corna, &amp; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin
Vitelli:</hi> all which three were very notable gentlemen
and great Captains, that did greatlie mislike that the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
of the left flanke of a band or squadron,<note place="margin">No piquers of a single band or squadron ought to carie their piques vpon their left shoulders.</note> should car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
their piques vpon their left shoulders, vtterly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the cause before alledged: saying, that the left flank
or side of piquers marching in their simple, or single or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of ranks, or in squadron, could not be more bewtified,
then by the wearing of their swords vpon their left sides,
and their piques vpon their right shoulders in soldiorlike
manner: besides that for right handed soldiors to carrie
their piques vpon their left shoulders when they are to
aduance, or vpright, or shoulder their piques, it dooth
giue a greater disequalitie and disgrace in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11434:11"/>
of those and diuers other effects; and therewithal
is a great deale more vnready for right handed souldiors,
for diuers other purposes to performe and vse; then if
they carried al their piques after one sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> vpon their right
shoulders. And as the opinions of diuers Captaines
are as aforesaid, that the carrying of their piques vpon
their left shoulders doth bewtifie the left flanke, because
it dooth resemble the right: So contrariwise, I say that
such as doo behold either the frunt or the backe of such
a band or squadron, shall see a disproportion and disequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
in the partition where the piquers of the left flank do
carry their piques in a different sort from al the rest of the
piquers of the right flanke. For all which causes before
alledged, with others, which for breuities sake I omit; I
would wish that all piquers should aswell in squadrons as
in their single order of rankes, carry all their piques vpon
their right shoulders, &amp; not vpon their left; except some
times when they are in march in the field to ease them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
they may change their piques to their left shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>Also if there were any piquers that were left handed
from their youth, I wold wish them to carrie their piques
vpon their right shoulders, and to practise and vse their
piques with their right hands, in couching and making
head with them against either horsmen or footmen, and
in all other militarie exercises and actions. And because
such left handed soldiors doo weare their swordes vpon
their right sides, I would wish that they should not be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
neither in single bandes, nor in squadrons, vpon the
vttermost flankes or sides of them, but in some other of
the inner ranks.</p>
            <p>And here it is to be noted that in reducing of a single
band or companie of soldiors into their simple,<note place="margin">How a single band co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting of 5 different sortes of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons should be formed to march in the plaine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen fields.</note> or single
order, the Captain, Lieutenant, or Sergeants of the band,
must haue great consideration in forming of their bands;
and chiefely consisting as our English bands doe of 5. dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
weapons; that is, of piques, batleaxes, musquetiers,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11434:12"/>
harquebuziers, and archers; and that they ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
in this sort following: First that they should place
the one halfe of the harquebuziers in frunt; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atlie
after them, should march the one halfe of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and after the archers, the one halfe of the musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
and after the musquetiers, al the ranks of the piquers
with the Ensigne in the midst or centre of them, guarded
with halbarders, or battleaxers; and after the piquers the
other halfe of the musquetiers, and after the musquetiers
the other half of the archers, and after them last of al the
other halfe of the harquebuziers; which band marching
in this sort, the one half of the different sorts of weapons
of volee marching before the piques,<note place="margin">A great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage and readines for bands march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this sort, to be reduced into other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>es.</note> and the other halfe
behind, both in like numbers of ranks &amp; in one order, they
are by that means alwaies ready vpon all occasions to be
reduced into any forme, or different forms to arme aswell
the back of the piquers by some called Rereward, as also
the frunt, flanks, &amp; al four corners of the said piques: as for
example, If the Captain of the band be disposed to arme,
and draw two sleeues of any one sort of those weapons of
volee by the flanks of the armed men, he may then with
great celerity perform the same, either by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding by
the stroke of the drum, or by som briefe speach, that al the
piquers and short wepons shal aduance their piques and
make a stand, and hauing reduced those armed men into
som kind of square, then one of the Sergeants of the band
is to draw down al the ranks of that weapon of volee, that
he would make his sleeue of, vpon the right flanke of the
piques in as many ranks as he listeth, and as many soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
in euery rank as pleaseth him, or as he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded;
&amp; so likwise at the same time &amp; instant another sergeant,
or the Lieutenant of the band (which Lieutenant ought
euer to march behind the hindermost ranke of the band
incase the Captain do march before) may draw vp by the
left flank of the piques the like number of ranks, &amp; of sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors
in euery rank of the same weapon of volee; and so
likewise with the like celerity vpon the different strokes of
the drum, or different briefe speaches of the Captain, all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11434:12"/>
the rest of the different sorts of weapons of volee by draw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
down as many ranks of them that doo march before
as he thinketh requisit, and drawing vp as many ranks of
those that do march behind or in rereward as he thinketh
meet; and employing the rest for skirmishes, or ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
or other seruices as he thinketh most conuenient;
they may with great dexteritie reduce them into diuers
different and variety of forms, aswell for the guard of the
frunt and back of the piques, as for the flanks &amp; corners,
and all other occasions and purposes.</p>
            <p>Also it is furder to be noted that if a Captain, marching

rankes, as also in trypling of them by right lyne, the
fourth ranke is now become to be the second ranke, and
the seuenth the third rank, and so subsequently in the rest,

            <p>But in the performance of this before set downe, the

that doubling of rankes by right line, or encresing them

if any man will aske the causes wherfore in reducing this

that then the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the pique and so should annoie the one the other, with
thrusts and foines (as they terme it) at all the length of
their Armes and piques, according to the vse of single
Combattes either in sport or earnest betwixt piquer and
piquer. By which kinde of fighting of squadrons at the
push of the pique, I say, that none of the rankes can fight
but only the first ranke, because that if they obserue their
proportionate distances according to order and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
the piques of the second rank are too short to reach
with their points the first rank of their enemies squadron
likewise standing still foining at all the length of their
Armes and piques; as they vainelie imagine: Yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
to the trouble and disorder of the first ranke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them they do thrust and foine ouer their shoulders;
During which time of the pushing and foyning of the
two first rankes of the two squadrons of enemies, all the
rest of the rankes of both the squadrons must by such an

their bellies full, or vntill they can fight no longer: which
is a very scorne and mockerie mylitarie to be either spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

any great numbers of piquers reduced into form of squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons

and true experience, such a squadron as should thinke it
their greatest aduantage to fight in that sort, must (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to discipline) inlarge themselues in their ranks and
distaunces both in frunt and by flankes, to the intent that
they may haue elbow roome enough without any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
by the nearnesse of the ranks behind them, to pul
backe their armes, and to thrust at their enemies appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
them at all the length they can of their armes and
piques, and againe with dexteritie to pull backe, &amp; retire
them to giue new thrusts: which opening &amp; enlargment
of ranks being perceiued by the contrarie squadron (who
if they be skilful men of warre) doe come closed in their
rankes both in frunt and by flankes, as close as they can
possiblie march pace with pace and step with step, as if
they were one entire body, carrying their piques with
both their hands breasthigh, all the points of the piques
of the first rank of one euennesse &amp; equality not any one
preceeding the other: And so likewise the points of al the
piques of the second, third and fourth ranks, carrying the
like equalitie and euennesse, but yet the points of euerie
ranke of piques, shorter and further distant almost by a
yard from their enemies faces, then the pointes of the
ranke that doo preceed them; And all those fower ranks
marching or moouing forward together pace with pace
and step with step, carrying their piques firmly with both
their hands brest high as aforsaid their points full in their
enemies faces, they doe altogether giue a puissant thrush,
the points of the first ranke of piques, first lighting vpon
the faces of the first ranke or rankes of their enemies; and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11434:19"/>
the points of the second, third, and fourth rankes, subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

opened and inlarged, that they neuer giue them any ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
any waies to pull backe and recouer the vse of their
piques to giue any new thrustes, nor yet to close their
ranks inlarged, but doo ouerthrow, disorder and breake
them with as great facilitie, as if they were but a flocke of
geese; as all men of right consideration and iudgement
may easilie consider and see.</p>
            <p>But after all this it may be, that some very curious and
not skilfull in actions of Armes, may demand what the
formost rankes of this well ordered and practised squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
before mentioned shall doo after they haue giuen
their aforesaid puissant blows &amp; thrusts with their piques
incase that they doo not at the first incountry ouerthrow
and breake the contrary squadron of their enemies: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
I say, that the foremost rankes of the squadron ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
with the points of their piques lighted vppon the
bare faces of the formost ranks of their enemies, or vpon
their Collers, pouldrons, quirasses, tasses, or disarmed
parts of their thighes; by which blowes giuen they haue
either slaine, ouerthrown, or wounded those that they
haue lighted vpon, or that the points of their piques ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vppon their armours haue glanced off, and beyond
them; in such sort as by the nearnes of the formost ranks
of their enemies before them, they haue not spacee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
againe to thrust; nor that by the nearnes of their
fellowes ranks next behind them, they haue any conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
elbowe roome to pull backe their piques to giue a
new thrust; by meanes whereof they haue vtterly loste
the vse of their piques, they therfore must either present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
let them fall to the ground as vnprofitable; or else may
with both their hands dart, and throw them as farre for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
into &amp; amongst the ranks of their enemies as they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11434:19"/>
can, to the intent by the length of them to trouble their
ranks, and presently in the twinkling of an eie or instant,
must draw their short arming swordes and daggers, and
giue a blow and thrust (tearmed a halfe reuerse, &amp; thrust)
all at, and in one time at their faces: And therewithall
must presentlie in an instant, with their daggers in their
left hands, thrust at the bottome of their enemies bellies
vnder the lammes of their Cuyrasses, or at any other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
parts: In such sort as then al the ranks of the whol
squadron one at the heeles of the other pressing in order
forward, doo with short weapons, and with the force of
their ranks closed, seeke to wound, open, or beare ouer
the rankes of their enemies to their vtter ruine: At which
time and action all the inner rankes of piques sauing the
first, 4. or 5. ranks, can with their piques worke no effect,
by reason that the said 4. or 5. rankes before them being
next to their enemies, are so neare and close together,
that they cannot with any thrust vse the pointes of their
piques against their said enemies, without endangering
or disordering their fellowes before them; For which
causes by al reason and experience militarie, short staued,
long edged, and short and strong pointed battleaxes or
halbards, of the length of 5. foot or 5. foot and a halfe in
all their lengths, at the vttermost, in the hands of lustie
and well armed soldiors that doo follow the first 5. rankes
of piquers at the heeles, doo both with blow at the head,
and thrust at the face, worke wonderfull effects, and doo
carrie all to the ground. By all which particularities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alleaged and declared, I thinke it may be apparant to
all such as are not obstinatelie ignorant, that Battles and
squadrons of piquers in the field when they doo incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and charge one another, are not by any reason or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
mylitarie to stand al day thrusting, pushing, and
foining one at another, as some doo most vainelie ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
but ought according to all experience with one pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issant

great effect.</p>
            <p>But in this case the mosquetiers must take great heed,
that they do not ouercharge their peeces with powder,

break or recoile, and so ouerthrow them to the trouble of
the piquers, from vnder whose piques they are to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

haileshot of warre by mosquetiers is for diuers times and
places of seruice, of great effect, so as they giue no volee
at the enemie aboue .20. paces at the furthest. And I do
furder aduertise that no musquetiers, nor harquebuziers,
reduced vnder the guarde of a sqadron of piquers, should
giue any volee, or volees of shot neither with full bullets
nor with any haileshot of warre at anysquadron or troupe
of Launces charging, or approaching to charge neither
.300 .200. nor yet .100. paces, with intent to recharge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,

with haileshott of warre, or full bullets, and being giuen

more horses and men, then. 10. volees of musquets or

and close themselues in their rankes by frunt and flankes,
as the piquers before them haue done; it commeth to
passe that they are so close together, that hauing no el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe
rome to discharge their peeces at some kinde of
point and blanke: the discharging of their shott vpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
accidents doth become more daungerous to their
fellowes piquers in the rankes before them, then any
waies to the Launces; because that being so neare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
euerie each one do so trouble the armes, peeces, and
handes of their companions; that when they thinke to
shoote ouer their fellowes piquers heads at the Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they are more likely to shoote too lowe, and to kill
some of their fellow piquers in the rankes before them, to
the daunger of the disordering of the whole squadron:
Besides that it is wonderfull daungerous if any flaske, or
tuchboxe by any accident should fall on fire by so many
matches light, being so neare together, which if it should
happen by one flaske or touchboxe taking fire; there is no
doubt but that the same would set on fire a great sort of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
flaskes and touchboxes, burning and scorching ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

would cause so great disorder and feare, that it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

according as he hath before determined either the one

the Sergeant Maior may giue order and reduce vpon the

through the straight; which being perfomed, then he is
to send the one halfe of the shott of all the diuers sorts of
volee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> did arme the right and left flanks of the squadron
to march before through the straight, I meane all such
weapons of volee as did arme the foreparts of both the
flankes and frunt of the squadron, and not the other halfe
of shott that did arme the hinder parts of the flankes, and
backe of the squadron, who are for the guard of the backe
or Rereward of the squadron, and for diuers other causes,
and accidental employments to remaine hindermost and
to march .5. in a ranke, and to follow the last comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of piquers into the straight, and that I would wish
to be performed in this order and sort following: First I
would send the compertiments of mosquetiers of the
right flank marching according to the narrownes of the
straight .5: in a ranke, and the harquebuziers of the same
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:11434:30"/>
flanke after them, backt with some light armed piquers
and halbarders; then I would send the compertiments of
archers likewise of the right flank marching .5. in a ranke,
then I would that the compertiments of mosquetiers and
harquebuziers that were for the guard of the left flanke
marching. 5. in a ranke, backt likewise with some num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of light armed piquers and halbardars, should follow
the archers of the right flanke, and that after them should
follow the archers of the forepart corner of the left flank,
which different compertiments of weapons of volee of
the forepart of the right flanke being marcht through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
straight into the plaine, should march so far on the right
hand, as there should be space and roome enough for the
compertiments of the piquers of the right flanke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
themselues into forme vpon their lefte flanke, and
that then euerie sort and weapon of volee should reduce
themselues into the same formes, of sleeues, winges, and
troupes and other such like, as they were vpon the right
corner and flanke of the squadron before that they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
into the straight:<note place="margin">Wher the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pertiments of the weapons of weapons of volee of the forepart of the right and left flankes of the Squadron bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marched through the straight, should reduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into forme.</note> Then would I that the different
Compertiments of the like weapons of volee of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte
of the left flanke of the squadron that haue followed
the first compertiments and are now likewise come
through the straight, should march so much on the left
hand of the plaine as they may leaue ground and space e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for the squadron of piquers to reduce themselues
into their forme betwixt them and the weapons of volee
of the right flank, &amp; that they there should again reduce
themselues into the like formes of sleeues, winges, and
troupes that they were vpon the forepart of the left flanke
before they marched through the straight. But it is to be
noted, that presently vpon the entring of the last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiments
of the forepart of the weapons of volee of the
left flanke into the straight, that the Sergeant Maior is to
come to the frunt of the right flanke of the squadron if

as well by such briefe speaches as aforesaid, as
by the sound of the trompettor and drummes, they are
all subsequentlie and orderlie with their compertimentes
to separate them and to followe one another by right

compertimentes haue marched one after another tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the straight into the plaine; so they are with all ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leritie
to reduce themselues by the left flanke the one of

throughout, as aforesaid, seeing the seconde comper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
reduced and doubled by the lefte flanke of the

so consequentlie the fourth, fifth, and all the reste of the
compertiments, are by their Captaines to bee lead and
reduced by the left flanks the one of the other; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by them performed, and the squadron reduced into
the same forme of number of ranks, &amp; of soldiors in euery
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11434:31"/>
ranke that it was before they entered into the straight;
then all the shot of the different weapons of volee that
did march through the straight before the first comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of piquers; I meane, the one halfe of those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came to the straight did arme the forepartes of
the right and left flankes of the squadron, and now againe
already before the squadron is altogether againe formed
by their Captaines and officers, reduced into the same
formes vpon the foreparts of the right and left flankes of
the squadron that they were before that they first separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselues from the squadron, and entred into the

of the squadron, that they were before the squadron did
enter into the passage.</p>
            <p>All which being performed, and al the harquebuziers,
mosquetiers, and halbarders that were sent to possesse the

that the squadron marching forwarde in the enemies

vpon the frunt, and the other halfe vpon the backe of the

And the cause wherefore I woulde haue no drummers
placed in the frunt of a squa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dron vppon the occasion of

through the greatnesse of those instruments, to vse

            <p>But heere it is furder to be noted that the squadron be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againe reduced into forme, and marching forward in

hand as that by reason and discipline military they ought
to keepe themselues in squadron; then they ought accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the bredth or frunt of their squadron, to deuide
the whole squadron into as few and as great comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of number of soldiors in euery ranke from frunt to

that by the greatnesse of their compertiments they may
a great deale the sooner reduce and forme their squadron
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:11434:32"/>
againe vpon any sudden or great Alarum: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
If the squadron were double as broad in frunt as by

or Sergeant Maior may presentlie command the
whole squadron to be deuided into 6. compertiments of

at the first forming of the same; or into any other forme
that the Coronell or Sergeant Maior shall thinke most
requisit by any one of the same orders of reducementes
that I haue before very particularly set downe.</p>
            <p>And it is furder to be obserued that the said squadron
marching in the open fields with sleeues, wings, &amp; troups
of weapons of volee belonging to the same, should euer
at certen times make certen pauses, aswel to the intent to
ease themselues and take breath, because that armed men
or mosquetiers with their heauy furniture, or the soldiors
of any other weapon cannot possibly continue any long
march without such pauses and staies, as also that if anie
dismarch or disorder hath hapned in their ranks, forms, or
orders, the same may be presently againe reformed and
redressed: And the like pauses and staies are to bee made
by bands of horsmen, for the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration &amp; causes.</p>
            <p>But now peraduenture some that may read this place
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:11434:32"/>
of my booke may say that I forgot in this place to write of
horsmen, aswell where they should be placed in the field
either vpon the flankes or corners of the compertiments
of diuers sortes of weapons of volee reduced into their
orders, as also in marching through the straight, whether
they should march halfe before and halfe behind, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
Wherevnto I answer that it were impertinent
to this place,<note place="margin">An obiection aunswered.</note> considering that here I doo but only shew,
how a Regiment of 4000. footmen vnder their coronels,
Captaines, and officers, without any bandes of horsmen
should be reduced into diuers formes aswell to march as
to fight; as also to passe through a passage or straight, and
being passed through the same; howe againe to reduce
themselues into forme; that by the ordering, forming,
and marching of this squadron and regiment as aforsaid,
all such as doo professe armes, and that doo not knowe
how squadrons of footmen should bee formed, may by
that which I haue before set downe, see, consider, and
obserue,<note place="margin">Bands and squadrons of horsemen are to be reduced into forme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the verie same order and sorte that foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are.</note> how any squadron of a great deale greater or
smaller numbers may diuers waies be reduced into form,
although in troth, bands and squadrons of horsemen are
to bee reduced into forme or diuers formes euen after
the verie same order and sort that bandes and squadrons
of footmen are. But yet something to satisfie such as
shall reade this my booke, I will by the helpe of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
God, in some places more conuenient, of these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
make mention, and set downe diuers verie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant

and one fawconet should with their horses be drawn
vppon the flanke, or side of the squadron, betwixt the

or any other waies, as I haue before very particularlie set

            <p>And this kind of iust square of armed men by frunt,
flankes, and backe, hath beene holden by some men of
warre,<note place="margin">The reasons that diuers me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of warre do al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leage to proue a iust squadron to be of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to fight.</note> and yet is, to be the most strong and puissant kind
of squadron of all others, in respect that the number of
rankes by flanks are equall with the number of souldiors
in frunt and backe; whereof ensueth (say they) vppon
the ioyning of two squadrons, and a battle well fought,
that commonlie many of the souldiors of the first rankes
are either ouerthrowne &amp; wounded, or slain in the place:
vpon which accidents, the souldiors that are in the next
rankes directlie behind them, are presently to bestride
them; I meane to stand ouer and defend them if they be
but wounded, and if they be slaine, then to take their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and so subsequentlie euery hinder ranke to fill vp the
ranke before them; so as only the hinder ranks shal come
to diminish and lacke number, by the supplying and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vp of the former ranks: By meanes of which entring
of souldiors out of the hinder rankes still to fill vppe the
formost rankes for the causes aforesaid, the opinion of
some men of warre hath been and is, that a iust squadron
of armed men, is of more resistance and annoyance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the enemie, then a broad squadron in frunt and
shorter by flankes is, I meane both the one squadron and
the other being neere about one number of souldiors; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all which it may bee alleaged, that such iust squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
in frunt, flankes, and backe, are more ready vppon
any sudden vnlooked for occasion, and comming of the
Enemie to make of any of both the flankes frunt, with a
conuenient breadth; then a squadron that is broad in
frunt, and narrow by flankes is able to performe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that the iust squadron hath no more to doo, but to
make of one of the flanks frunt by turning their faces and
weapons that waies, and to reforme their distaunces by
frunt and flankes: whereas the broad squadron to make
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11434:35"/>
of flanke frunt, must not onely doo the like, but also must
draw out a great sort of rankes from the contrary flanke,
and draw them vp to the head of that flanke, that is nowe
made frunt, and also reforme themselues in their distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by frunt and flanke, with diuers other particularities
by me at large before set downe.</p>
            <p>But incase that the sergeant Maior when he hath four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
this iust square of men,<note place="margin">How a Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Maior ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing formed a iust square may vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shorten the same by flankes and inlarge them in frunt.</note> and not of ground as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
shall vpon any occasion thinke it requisite to inlarge
the same squadron in frunt, that is to increase euery rank
from frunt to back with some conuenient number of sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors,
and to shorten the same squadron by flanke, that is
to make fewer rankes; then hee may with great celeritie
and dexteritie draw out as many rankes from the back or
rereward, as hee shall see requisite to inlarge the frunt
withall, and draw them vp by one of the flankes: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the squadron commeth to be shortned by flanks, by
so many rankes as the Sergeant Maior hath drawne out
from the backe or Rereward, and therfore that there shal
remaine an ouerplus of broken rankes more then at one
time can be drawne vp by flankes as aforesaid: the serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Maior then must consider whether the numbers of
the piquers of those broken ranks, be sufficient to increase
one ranke more by backe: And incase there doo lacke
number to performe the same; then hee is to consider
whether the numbers of the piquers of those broken
rankes, will serue to increase euery ranke one souldior or
more by flanke; which is to be vnderstood from frunt to
backe; and as he may with those broken rankes best per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
either the one or the other, he is to doo the same.
But incase that the Sergeant Maior shall see that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
men of those broken ranks doo lacke number to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
as well that by flanke, as the other by backe (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,)
hee then is to place them in the ranke of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
or otherwise to employ them in other seruices as
he shall thinke most requisite: The particularities of all
which with many more I haue before set downe at large,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11434:36"/>
and therefore it were superfluous to particular the same
againe. And now as I haue formed this foresaid battle
and iust square of 60. piquers in frunt, flanks, and backe,
which in all do amount to 6600. men, with diuers other
requisite matters: Euen so by the like orders of reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
If a Lord Marshall or a Sergeant Maior Maior,
haue 4000. or 5000. yea or 10000. or more or fewer pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
to reduce into one bodie of squadron, hee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them into a battle of a thirde part broader in frunt
then by flanks; or double as broad or more in frunt then
by flankes; or otherwise as he thinketh most conuenient:
As for example; If he haue 5355. piquers, and that hee
woulde reduce them all into one squadron, double as
broad or more by frunt then by flankes, as of 105. piquers
in frunt, and but of 51. rankes by flankes; and that hee
would reduce his squadron into form, by compertiments
throughout of 5. in a ranke; he shall then finde that 21.
compertimentes reduced into squadron by flanke or
flankes as aforesaid, will forme that squadron, of 105. pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
in euerie rank from frunt to backe, and of 51. ranks
by flankes.</p>
            <p>Or if the Sergeant Maior, be disposed to forme the
same squadron of the like number of 5355. piquers with
greater compertiments as of 7. in euery compertiment
throughout from frunt to back, that thereby he may form
his squadron with the fewer compertimentes; hee may
then command all the Captains or leaders of the piquers
to reduce euery one of their compertimentes into 7. in a
rank throughout from frunt to back; and then he shal find
that 15. such compertiments or diuisions of 7. in a ranke
throughout euery compertiment reduced into squadron
either by the flanks the one of the other, or by both flanks
subsequently al at one time, (as I haue in the beginning of
this proiect of squadrons very particularlie declared) doo
make iust 105. piquers in frunt, and 51. rankes by flanke,
which is more then double as broad in frunt, then long
by flankes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:11434:36"/>But because peraduenture there are some professing
armes not knowing how squadrons should be fourmed
that will imagine,<note place="margin">The orders and waies of reducing of 3000. or 4000. or of. 10000. or of any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of piquers into one bodie of squadron, are all one sauing that the compertiments are to be made longer by flanks.</note> that it is a matter of farre greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
to forme a squadron of 10000. or 12000. piquers,
or of greater numbers, then of 3000. or 4000. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
I say, that the orders and waies of reducing of
3000. or 4000. or of 10000. or any greater numbers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one bodie of squadron is all one, sauing that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertimentes
or diuisions of piquers, or of piquers and
short weapons to forme great squadrons must be longer
by flankes, then the compertimentes of small squadrons
are: and therefore whereas the number of piquers of one
bande, or companie are sufficient to make a compleat
compertiment of number of piquers by frunt, as of 5. 6.
7. or any such euen or odde numbers, not exceding 10.
or 11. as also of numbers of rankes conuenient by flanks
to beginne the squadron withall; and that so likewise the
piquers of other such single bandes are able to performe
the like, beeing reduced by the flankes the one of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as aforesaid, whereof it shoulde come to passe that
such small squadrons should bee composed of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiments
of single bands by themselues; yet great squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
or battles double as broad in frunt, as long by
flankes, or iust squares, or any other formes, must bee
composed of compertimentes although of like numbers
in frunt as aforesaide: yet much longer by flankes, which
to performe, because no one band haue piquers enough

2. bandes presentlie to bee reduced into one comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so likewise of other bandes, to the intent that
by such great compertiments he may with the more ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leritie

forme and reduce his squadron of 10000. or 12000.
piquers, or any greater, or smaller numbers into one
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11434:37"/>
squadron or battle; and that hee would forme the same
double as broad by frunt as long by flankes; hee may by
the like order of reducing of compertimentes of greater
numbers by flanks, performe the same with as great faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
as hee did in the reducing of the other squadrons of
smaller numbers with the compertiments of single bands
into forme.</p>
            <p>And therfore if a Sergeant Maior Maior would forme
one battle of aboue 10000. piquers, and that hee would
make them double as broad or more in frunt then long
by flankes: As for example, of 143. in frunt, and of 71.
rankes by flankes; he is first to consider how many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiments
of euen and od numbers wil make that frunt,
and he shall find that 17. compertiments of 8. souldiors
in euery ranke from frunt to backe, and of 71. rankes by
flankes in euery compertiment reduced into squadron by
flanke or flankes (as I haue verie particularlie in my first
forming of squadrons before declared) doo make y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
in frunt 136. souldiors, and then drawing vppe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of 8. and one of 7. which are odde, which in all are
18. compertiments. All which diuisions reduced into

souldiors.</p>
            <p>But now whereas all these squadrons before reduced
and described do consist only of piquers with a few hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardiers
for the guard of the Ensignes,<note place="margin">The chiefe causes why the Italians and Spaniards, haue of late vsed squadrons altogither of piques.</note> which hath bene

the piques, then if there were many rankes of short
weapons within the piques, which through the shortnes
of the weapons would make the squadron to shewe vnto
the Enemie as though there were a voide place without
any soldiors in the midst of the piques: Yet because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares past I haue in Fraunce seene the Sergeants Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iors
of the Suissers reduce certen rankes of halbardiers
within their piques, thereby according to discipline to
strengthen their battles aswell against the charges of hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
as against squadrons of footmen piquers: I will here
(with the helpe of Almightie God) sett downe and shew
how a squadron of halbardiers or battleaxes, inuironed
or impaled about with 5. rankes of piquiers in frunt, flanks
and backe, should be reduced into a squadron broader by
a third parte in frunt and backe,<note place="margin">How a squadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of halbardiers enuironed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, with 5. rankes of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers, should be reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to forme.</note> then long by flankes:
which is to be performed in this sort following, that is,
Incase that I haue .1500. armed battleaxes, or halbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and that I were disposed to reduce them into .50 in
frunt, and .30. by flankes, and that I would deuide that
whole number into .10. compertiments of .5. battleaxes
in euery ranke throughout euery compertiment: so as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
compertiment from frunt to backe should containe
150. battleaxes; Or that I were disposed to commaund
the .1500. battleaxes to be reduced into .5. comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of 10. souldiors in euery ranke throughout euerie
compertiment from frunt to backe, that is of 300. soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors
in euery compertiment, the same being by the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and officers performed, I then appointing the
ground where I would make the frunt of the squadron,
would command the Captaines or leaders of euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiment
either of .5. if the compertiments be all of .5.
or of .10. if they be of .10. soldiors throughout euerie
compertiment to march vp, the one by the flanke of the
other, vntill they come all to make one equall frunt in
their iust &amp; proportionate distances from frunt to backe:
which being performed then I would commaund two
compertiments all of piquers, each one of them of .150.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11434:38"/>
marching .5. in a ranke to be drawne vp, the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiment
of .150. close by the right flanke of the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes:
and the other compertiment of the like number in
like sort close by the left flanke of the battleaxes vntill the
formost rankes of both those compertiments of piquers
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both flanks be of equal frunt with the frunt of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleaxes,
and their last ranke equall with the last ranke of

that they were in frunt before, now by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioining
and reducing of those 2. compertiments of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
vpon the two flankes as aforesaid, the squadron is
come to be of 60. soldiors in euery ranke from frunt to

piquers reduced into 60. rankes of 5. in euery ranke to be
drawne close by the frunt of the squadron of battleaxes &amp;
piquers before reduced, euen from the one flanke and
corner to the other: And at the very same instant, I would
command 60<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ranks of piquers more of 5. in euery ranke
to be drawne close by the backe, and Rereward of the
same squadron: which being performed, then aswell the
60. ranks of piquers 5. in a ranke in frunt, as the 60. ranks
of piquers 5. in a ranke in backe, are either vpon the sound
of the trumpet, or the stroake of drummes to tourne their
faces and weapons, and to make of flanke frunt: I meane
that waies that the squadron of battleaxes, and the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
on the flankes do make frunt, and therewithall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to reforme themselues in their distances: so as of
60. rankes of 5. in euerie ranke that the same comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of piquers that was reduced in frunt was before, it
is now by making of flanke frunt as aforsaid, become to
be of 5. rankes of 60. soldiors in euery ranke: And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the aforesaid compertiments of the like number of
300. piquers of 5. in euery ranke reduced vpon the backe
of the squadron, by making of flanke frunt, towards the
squadron of battleaxes and piquers, are now likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to be 5. rankes by flanke, and 60. in euerie ranke.
All which being performed the squadron of battleaxes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11434:38"/>
dooth come to be enuironed or empaled with 5. rankes
of piquers in frunt, flankes, and back, the whole squadron
conteining in frunt 60. soldiors, &amp; by flanks 40. rankes.</p>
            <p>And now this squadron being thus formed; then would
I reduce all the different sortes of weapons of volee into
their most conuenient forms of forlorn hopes, of sleeues,
of winges, of hearses, of troupes, and other formes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature and effect of euery different sort of

therewithall regard as wel to arme the backe or rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

the frunt and flanks. And as I haue very particularly she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
how a squadron of Halbardiers or battleaxes, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
about with 5. rankes of piquers should be reduced
into the forme aboue described, and therewithall said
that the same should be armed in frunt, flankes and back,
with weapons of volee of diuers sorts, so would I if I had
conuenient numbers of horsemen of diuers armors and
weapons, arme the same squadron, and sleeues, &amp; wings
of weapons of volee, with horsemen in their due &amp; most

            <p>First,<note place="margin">The placing of the seuerall battles of the Armie.</note> I would place the vauntgard and Reregard both
of one equall frunt, but yet so farre distant the one from
the other, as that there might be ground &amp; place enough
betwixt them to reduce so many troupes, sleeues, wings,
and other formes of all the different sorts of weapons of
volee footmen, belonging to those two battles, as ought
to bee (according to the disposition of the ground and
comming of the Enemie) reduced and placed vppon the
outer flanks and corners of those 2. battles: And I would
that of the 2500. halbardiers before reserued and not pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
one thousand deuided into 2. partes of 500. halbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in each part should be placed in many little societies
and troupes of ten halbardiers in euery societie, some in
guard of the field peeces belonging to those two battles,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:11434:40"/>
and all the rest behind in Rereward at the backes of the
troupes and winges of the weapons of volee, ready vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any occasion to succour them and to annoy the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:
I meane that the said 1000. halbarders deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
2. parts of 500. in each part, that the one 500. deuided
and placed in their little troupes as aforesaid, should bee
for the succour and guard of the weapons of volee of the
vaungard, and the other 500. should be for the succor &amp;
guard of the weapons of volee of the Rereguard, which
performed, then would I place the other two squadrons
of battle and a Rereregardrereward in two wings, but not
so farre forward as the hindermost rankes of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
battles by 150. paces or more, with all theyr diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
sortes of weapons of volee, reduced into their most
conuenient formes, with one thousand Halbardiers also
taken out of the 1500. yet remaining vnplaced, equallie
deuided 500. to each battle for the guard of the field pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and succor of the weapons of volee as is before more
at large set downe: And those twoe hindermost battles
I would also place of one equall frunt, that is, the one as
farre forward as the other, but so farre seperated and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
the one from the other, and so farre without and in
winge, the one on the right hande, and the other on the

inner flankes of those two hindermost squadrons, might
not onelie haue roome inough to bee reduced into their
most conuenient formes, according to the nature &amp; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
dispositions and effects of euery sort of them, but
also in such sort, as that both those two hindermost bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
with all their weapons of volee might (without any
impediment of the two formost battles and their wepons
of volee, or of any their hearses, troupes, or squares of
horsmen) haue the comming of the enemies battles, and
squares, and troupes of horsmen, so apparant and cleare

               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:11434:40"/>All which reducements of those foresaid 4. battles,

of dimilaunces, of Stradiots, of Archers and Crosbow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
on horsebacke (as are before particularlie set downe)
to arme the flankes of the aforesaid foure battles: I would
first giue order that the 240. men at Armes shoulde bee
deuided into 4. winges, that is into 60. men at Armes in

I would reduce either into 3. rankes of 20. in euery ranke,<note place="margin">How &amp; where the men at Armes should be ordered and placed.</note>
or else into 4. rankes of 15. in euerie ranke, and woulde
place two of those hearses or broade squares of men at

the other broad square or hearse of men at Armes in
like sort, euen by flanke and right ouer against the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest

with many squares and troupes of horsmen of diuers dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

following, arme those 4. squadrons with certen field pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
according to the ordinarie vse of this time for the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:11434:43"/>
greater annoiance of the Enemie, and for the more sure
guard of the battles. First, incase there were any little hil
or high ground of aduantage of any conuenient neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
vnto the two formost battles, that might command
the open fieldes and plaines where the Enemies battles
should march and approch, then I would there place so
many field peeces as should bee requisite for that ground
of aduauntage, with some trench or trenches by good
numbers of laborers and pioners vppon the sudden cast,
and those peeces well and stronglie guarded with conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
numbers of piquers, halbardiers, and archers, and
would place the rest of the field peeces, vpon the flanks of
the battles in their most conuenient places, with their
powder, bullets, and all other thinges that do appertaine
to the vse of them for the annoiance of the Enemie. But
incase there were no such grounds nor ground of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
as aforesaid where to plant such peeces of artillerie,
then would I place 3. fawcons ranforced of 6: poundes
the bullet, and one fawconet ranforced of 3. pounds the
bullet, some 8. or 10. paces wide from the right corner of
the vaungard, and aduaunced furder forward then y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> frunt
and Corner of that battle by the like number of paces
with their gunners and all their aides and thinges apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
vnto those peeces well guarded with conuenient
numbers of halbardiers; And so likewise would place the
like numbers of 3. fawcons and one fawconet in the like
distances wide and aduanced furder forwarde, then the
left corner of the same battle, by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> like number of paces,
with their gonners and all their aides and other thinges
appertaining vnto those peeces, well guarded also with
conuenient numbers of halbardiers.</p>
            <p>And as I haue now armed the frunt of the said vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
with the number of field peeces before planted, so
would I arme the fruntes of the other 3. battles of Rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
of maine battle, and of a Rereregardrereward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
placed and described, each battle with the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of field peeces planted in like distaunces from the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:11434:44"/>
frunt and corners of them, well guarded also with Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardiers
as aforesaid. And although the backs and Rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
of all those 4 battles should not need to bee armed
with any fielde peeces, as it shall bee within fewe lines
heereafter apparant by the rest which I will set downe
concerning those matters: yet to arme those 4. battles
in the greatest perfection that I can, I would place vpon
euery corner of the backs and Reregards of all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
4. battles, two fawcons and one fawconet in like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunces
of paces that I haue before placed the field pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from the corners of the frunt of the aforesaid 4. bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.</p>
            <p>But heere it is to bee noted that although diuers great
Captaines that haue bin commanders and leaders of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
haue alwaies accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted Sakers of 10. or 12. pounds
their bullets and other peeces from 10. poundes downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to Robinets of one pound to bee in the number of
fielde peeces,<note place="margin">Of what height the field pieces ought to bee.</note> yet I to arme any battle with field peeces in
the open fieldes, would vse no peeces aboue the heigth
of fawcons of 6. pounds the bullets, and no smaller pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
then fawconets of 3. pounds the bullets, vnlesse it were
some Robinets of one pound the bullet, and those moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vpon carriages after the manner of Germanie light

wherefore I would vse no peeces of any greater heigth
for the field, are, that to vse Sakers of 10. or 12. pounds
the bullets in the fielde, such peeces I say doo require
more Horses, or Oxen to drawe them, and men to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
them, then Fawconets of 3. poundes, or Fawcons
of 6. poundes doo, which ouerplus and greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Horses or Oxen of draught, doo vpon the remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of those horses or oxen, and drawing them backe
when the peeces are planted, giue a great deale more
impediment and trouble not onely to the Gonners and
their aydes, but also to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he sleeues, winges, and troupes
of the weapons of Volee, that are reduced on the flankes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:11434:44"/>
and Corners of squadrons, then the small number of
horses belonging to fawconets of three pounds or Faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
of 6. pounds doo.</p>
            <p>Also Armies sometimes in marching in the open
and plaine fieldes, doo light vpon sandie and such other
softish and yeelding groundes, where either vppon the
drawing or discharging of Sakers of 10. or 12. poundes
the bullets, their Wheeles doo sinke so deepe into the
ground, that oftentimes they giue great impediment
and let to the Gonners and their aides to manage and
vse them, vpon diuers needefull occasions; besides that,
vppon their discharginges the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> worke no greater effect
against the Enemie, then such Fawcons and fawconets
as aforesaid doo.</p>
            <p>Also it is further to be noted that I would neuer place
aboue the number of 8. field peeces by the flanks or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of any battle, nor vnder the number of 4. I meane
that I woulde neuer place aboue 3. Fawcons and one
Fawconet, and those in conuenient distances wide from
the right Corner of the Battle, and 3. Fawcons and one
Fawconet, wide and in like distaunces from the left frunt
and corner of the same Battle, or at the fewest 2. Faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
and one Fawconet, some 8. or 10. paces wide from
the one Corner, and 2. Fawcons and one Fawconet
wide in the like distaunce from the other Corner of the
fame Battle, and that in respect that too manie fielde
peeces beeing drawen and marching vppon the flankes
of squadrons to the intent to bee planted as abouesaid
vppon the day of battle, are for diuers causes and vppon
diuers accidentes of farre greater impedimentes and
trouble, then any waies profitable to their owne Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons.</p>
            <p>Also it is further to bee noted that I woulde neuer
place any Fielde peeces directlie before the frunt of anie
Squadrons or Battailes, vnlesse I thought our forces in
the field to bee much inferiour in strength to the Enemy,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:11434:45"/>
because that peeces so planted would be a great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vnto the battles marching forwarde to incounter
with the enemie, by reason that such squadrons should
be compelled by such peeces so planted to open &amp; break
their rankes, and to disorder themselues, which is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of great danger the Enemie being in sight or neere at
hand. And now hauing armed all the aforesaid 4. bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
with field peeces in their most fitte and conuenient
places, there resteth to shew what should become of the
Cariages and baggages of the Campe, as also where the
ouerplus of the horsemen and footmen that are not yet
placed, ought to be emploied.</p>
            <p>The Carriages of all Armies and Camps do consist of
two sorts, the one sorte that are publique, as of treasure
and pay for the Armie, of great quantitie of powder both
for great and small shot, of armor and weapon, of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie,
as of Cannons, Culuerings, demy Cannons, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Culuerings, &amp; Sakers and other smaller pieces, with
all things belonging vnto them, of diuers sorts of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of prouision, of pieces maniable also, as of Curriers of
warre, of mosquets, harquebuzes and other such pieces,
with all things belonging vnto them, of bowes &amp; sheafes
of arrowes, and Crosbowes, gaffles, and quarrells, with
piques, halbardes, targets, Launces, Launcezagaies and
all other sorts of armors and weapons both offensiue and
defensiue, with boates also to make bridges ouer riuers &amp;
all thinges appertaining vnto them: And to be briefe, of
many other munitions &amp; prouisions, al which being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
for the vse of the whole Armie or Campe, are vnder
the charge of the Maister of the Ordinaunce. And as for
the other Carriages and baggages that are priuate they
are such as do belong vnto Cheistaines, Coronells, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
and other higher and lower men of charge and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and to be short to all the soldiors of the Army that
haue any thing to be caried: All which priuate Cariages
also, are vnder the Maister of the Ordinance his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement

would that the treasure should be caried either vpon mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
or horses, or rather vpon close couered waggons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of Germanie, and those carriages placed
towardes the midst of the square on the right hande, and
that the waggons or Carts that do carrie the cheife sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the powder, should be placed also towardes the
midst of the square on the left hand, and that both those
sorts of carriages should bee very strongly guarded with
good numbers of halbardiers, and that all the great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of batterie and artillery with powder and bullets,
and all other things belonging vnto them should be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

the frunt and backe, as vpon the outer flankes and sides of
the same square: And I would that all the rest of the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
should be reduced into 2. 3. or 4. ranks in the forme
of a Rainebow, a semicircle or halfe round at the back of
the most important publique cariages which are be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the semicircle should be so farre extended and drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great Compasse circular, that the right ende thereof
should haue right ouer against the left flanke &amp; corner of

of Cariages being performed, I would then take the 500.
halbardiers, and the 900. piquers, which at the first for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the 4. battles were reserued and not any where

archers, and the. 3000. harquebuziers and mosquetiers,
which are reduced and placed in many sleeues, winges,

all the aforesaid 900. piquers 500. halbadiers and 12000.
wepons of volee of different sorts into 4. parts, 3. parts of
the which being reduced into diuers squares and troupes,
I would should be reduced vpon the backe and both the
Corners of the semicircle, with certen fawconetts and

            <p>Now as for the fourth part and diuision of the weapons

would that. 100. of them should be placed vnder their
Conductors in diuers little troupes &amp; societies vpon the

that the other 20. light horsmen vnder the like Conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

            <p>And now all these reducements before set downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:11434:47"/>Also I would take 1600. more of those pioners and

to make head against and resist al attempts either of hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

the approach of the Enemy that is now in sight to giue
battle: Then I would wish according to the auncient vse
of many Warlike Nations, to the intent that it might
please Almightie God to prosper this Armie with victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that vpon the sound of the Lord Lieutenants trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
for the displaieng of the standard Royall of the Army,
to the intent to giue battle, the Enemie being in sight and
approching, all the souldiors should be instructed and
taught long before to say this short praier following, or
some other to the like effect.</p>
            <p>O Almightie,<note place="margin">A short prayer to be saide by soldiors, vpon the approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and, sight of the Enemies battle.</note> Eternall, and incomprehensible God,

of thy holy Name.</p>
            <p>And this said praier, I would wish to be said vpon the
sight of the Enemies battles by all the squadrons of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

souldiors of weapons of volee vpon their knees in their
Rankes as they stand. And that all the horsmen of euery
sort of weapon should on horseback vse the same or the
like short praier.</p>
            <p>And therewithall I thought good furder to aduertise,
that those squadrons being so formed or in any other sort,<note place="margin">It is not lawful nor sufferable for any soldior vppon the near approach of the Enemie, to turne his face.</note>
to the intent to giue battle to the Enemie, all the soldiors
piquers, and halbardiers should be instructed and taught
long before, that it is not lawfull nor sufferable for any of
the souldiors of any ranke reduced into forme of battle,
when vpon the very neere approch of the enemies squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
they haue vprighted their piques, to the intent with
the points of them to charge or receiue a charge of their
Enemies be they either horsemen or footmen, so much
as once to turne their faces to looke behind them: And
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11434:48"/>
to the intent that they may bee the more terrified from
any waies turning their faces to look backe (which doth
argue feare) they are to be instructed according to disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
that it shall bee lawfull for the souldiors of euerie
Ranke to wound or kill any souldior or souldiors of the
ranke before them vppon the turning of their faces and
bodies to looke backe: and the same is to bee performed
euen from the verie first to the last rankes: And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
is to be obserued to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent to make all the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors

without shewing any suspicion or so much as one

            <p>But now after my describing verie particularlie and
at large this said Armie reduced into the forme &amp; formes
aforesaid, to the intent that thereby all Gentlemen affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to matters of armes, and souldiors may with great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie
vnderstand mine intention and meaning; it may
bee that some gentlemen not experienced in matters of
armes, will in reading this my proiect imagine that the
reducement and forming of an armie into diuers battles
and other formes, dooth appertaine onely to the Lorde
Lieutenant Generall, or to the Lord high Marshall of the
armie; and that the same should be performed onley by
one of them, one peece after another: And that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
may imagine the rather; because I in my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
reducing and forming of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armie by way of discourse
doe write, and say, that first I would reduce and place the
vaungard, then the Reregard, and then the other two
battles, and the Weapons of volee, and after the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of diuers sorts of armors and Weapons in this sort,
and in that sort, with many other particularities and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances:
Vnto which their misimaginations I say,
that it is not one mans worke; although it were <hi>Iulius
Caesar</hi> himselfe, to reduce a whole armie into diuers forms
of battle with celeritie when they are to march in the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Countrey, or to fight with the Enemie, but that the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:11434:48"/>
same must be of necessitie perfourmed by diuers Chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and higher and lower officers of the armie: And yet
that notwithstanding, it is not possible to perfourme the
same with art, celeritie, and Discipline, vnlesse the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and order thereof doo proceede either from the
onely mouth of the Chiefetaine of the armie, or from
the Lorde high Marshall, or some other chiefe Officer
by them appointed; And therefore it dooth behooue
(which of them soeuer dooth giue the order) to haue the
forme and formes, of all the battles, squares and troupes,
as well of horsemen as of footemen with the scituation
and nature of the ground and groundes, and many other
particularities in his memorie and head; and that in so
great perfection, as if hee with his eies did at that instant
behold and see the whole armie in the field reduced into
all his intended formes.</p>
            <p>And therefore to perfourme the same, it is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
vse of all skilfull Chieftaines of armies and Lorde
Marshals when they haue concluded and resolued with
themselues by the aduise of their Councell,<note place="margin">The ordinarie proceedinge of al skilful Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainsof Armies in their reduce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of batles.</note> into what

being by him performed; they presently do resort euerie
one to their owne charges, and doo giue order to their

all other officers vnto whom the execution of those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
and actions doo appertain, for the performance of
al those reducements and orders that they haue receiued
of the Chiefetaine of the armie, or from the Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall:
which doone, then all the Captaines both of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:11434:49"/>
horsmen and footmen, and all their officers, doo with all
celeritie reduce their bandes into order, and march into
the field, where the Lord Lieutenant Generall, with the
Lord Marshall, and Sergeant Maior generall, do ouersee
and direct the Coronels, Sergeant Maiors and Captains,
in the ordering and forming of their battles, troupes and
other formes. And thus by this ordinarie proceeding of
all skilfull Chieftaines of Armies in their reducementes
and formings of battles and Campes, those and all other
matters militarie of any great importance, are with great
facility, and in very short time performed.</p>
            <p>And now hauing shewed all the most co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and reasons would wish a Lieutenant generall, or lord
Marshall of a puissant Armie, rather to forme 6. 7. or 8.
smaller battles; incase the number of the Armie bee so
great that the same by reason militarie may bee perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

mentioned battles I would should consist of. 2000. to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
battle, and that euery one of them being reduced in
to squadrons should consist in frunt, that is in euery ranke
from frunt to backe of 50. piquers, and by flankes of. 40.
rankes, ouerplus of broken rankes not any one soldior.
And these 6. foresaid battles reduced into the formes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
and flankt and wing'd with weapons of volee of
diuers sorts according to discipline and the comming of
the enemy; in mine opinion should be of great aduantage
to encounter with 15000. armed men their enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
but only into. 3. batles of 5000. to euery battle;
by reason that whilest the 3. formost battles each of them
consisting of 3000. as aforesaid, do confrunt with the. 3.
great batles of 5000. in each battle, the other 3. battles of
a vauntregard Rereward and of the battle of succor, and
of a Rereregard Rereward, that doo march in winges in
Rereward retired, as aforesaid, may with great celeritie
and dexteritie by marching and auauncing themselues
forward, charge the flankes of their enemies 3. battles,
and put them in great hazard of disordering &amp; breaking:
Howbeit here it may be obiected against mine opinion,
that in case the 3. great battles of the enemy of. 5000. to
euery battle were each one of them reduced into. 125.
armed men in frunt, &amp; of 40. rankes by flankes; that their

of vaungard, battle, and Reregard, they might euerie one
of them in ioyning frunt to frunt with them, in respect
that euery one of the great battles of. 5000. to euery
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:11434:50"/>
batle doth beare a greater bredth by the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of. 28. sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors

in euery squadron do, with great aduantage draw vp a
sleeue of 28. in euery ranke, and of 40. rankes by flankes;
and finding themselues full against the flanke of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
squadron, they may suddenly make of flanke frunt
by tourning their faces and weapons towards the flanke
of the foresaid littlesquadrons, and then reforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in their distances, and closing themselues in frunt
and flanks, may bend their piques and charge the flankes
of the little squadrons to their most assured ruine. Or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
vpon the inconsiderate ioining of any one of the
small squadrons of 3000. being in frunt but. 75. with the
verie midst of the frunt of the great battles of. 5000. that
do consist of 125. piquers in frunt; the foresaid great squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
vpon such an aduantage offered, may drawe vp
each of them two sleeues from each side or flanke of their
squadron one of. 14. piquers in euery ranke, and finding
themselues euen vpon both the flankes of the little squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron;
they may of their flankes make frunt, and so of. 14.
that they were before in euery ranke, they are now by
making of flanke frunt become to be 40. in euerie ranke,
and in length by flankes 14. soldiors, and so by reforming
their distances and straightning and closing themselues
in frunt and by flanks as aforesaid, may with their piques
charge both the flankes of the little squadron to their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
disorder and ouerthrow. To which obiection I say,
that those foresaid aduauntages and others might be very
well taken against the 3. little squadrons of vaungard, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and Reregard, if it were not that the other 3. little bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of succor of 2000. to euery squadron, euery of them
of. 50. piquers in frunt, marching in Rereward in distincte
battles by them selues were not alwaies ready vpon the
drawing vp of all such sleeues or winges from the bodies
of the great squadrons, suddenly with great dexteritie to
charge them either in frunt flanks or backe, to their most
assured ruine and ouerthrow. But againe it may be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:11434:50"/>
further alledged in fauor of the great battles, that al squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of armed men piquers doo alwaies march, wing'd,
&amp; flankt with conuenient numbers of weapons of volee,
in such sort as those weapons of volee should be a great
impediment to the forsaid little squadrons to charge the
sleeues, and wings as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Vnto the which I say, that true it is, that all well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
battles, are wing'd and flankt with shot of diuers sorts
and that it hath beene and is a maxime amongest al men
of warre of great experience and Iudgement, that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
sleeues, winges and troupes of shot beeing deuided
into many small diuisions, are a great deale more apt and
ready to bee emploied at one time, into more different
and effectuall seruices to worke great effectes then any
great diuisions of shot can bee: Which if it be so, as most
certen it is by all experience Militarie; then the 3. battles
of 5000. to euery battle hauing 10000. weapons of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee
of diuers sortes to be reduced vnder their safeguard,
must diuide those 10000. into so many compertimentes
and diuisions of sleeues, winges and troupes, as are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to guard 3. such battles; As also the diuisions of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
of volee themselues to bee protected and defended
vnder the safeguard of those 3. squadrons; and so likewise
the 15000. armed men beeing reduced into 6. little bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
as aforesaid, hauing the like number of weapons of
volee of diuers sorts to aide them, and to be by them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
must by all order militarie diuide those 10000.
weapons of volee into double as many or more diuisions
of sleeues, wings and troups then the 3. great battles haue
diuided theirs for their aide. From all which experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
reasons and examples I come to conclude that as
15000. armed footemen reduced but onely into 3. great
battles cannot by any reason militarie haue so manie
sleeues, winge, troupes, &amp; other diuisions of diuers sorts
of shot vnder their safegard, as 15000. armed men redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into 6. smaller battles may haue: Euen so that the 3.
great squadrons of armed men with their few &amp; great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of shot cannot possibly by any reason or experience
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:11434:51"/>
worke so great effects, as the 6. smaller battles their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
with their many and more conuenient diuisions of
diuers sorts of weapons of volee may worke.</p>
            <p>And now whereas I haue before fourmed a squadron
and diuers squadrons all of halbardiers or battleaxes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed
or empaled about with 5. rankes of piquers in
frunt, flankes and backe; and that the short weapons are
in greater number then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> piques; &amp; therfore by some in
these daies (that doo more regard the new fashions, and
fancies of the disordered and corrupted <hi>Militia,</hi> that of
very late yeares in diuers ciuill warres haue crept into
Christendome, then the true discipline, art, and science
militarie, which hath beene practised and vsed from age
to age of all antiquitie, in the warres betwixt Emperors,
Kinges, and puissant Common wealthes) it may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
be thought, that such a squadron is no waies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
for all great effects and purposes to a squadron of
the like number al of piquers without any short weapons,
sauing onely a very fewe for the guard of the Ensignes:
Thervnto I say, that I doo thinke this squadron of short
weapons enuironed with 5. ranks of piques as aforesaid,
to be of a great deale more aduantage, strength and effect
aswell against horsmen as footmen, then any squadron
of the like number all of piquers can be. And because it
shall be apparant that I am not carried with new fashions
and fancies, but with the obseruation of that which I
haue read, hath been in vse and obserued by diuers braue
Nations in many ages, as also by mine owne hearing the
opinions of diuers great Captaines, Coronels, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants
Maiors of diuers warrelike Nations, some of late
yeares dead, and some yet aliue; And therwithall by that
which I haue seene and obserued my selfe, in the squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of diuers Nations, some of the which haue vsed
squadrons all of piquers as aforesaid, and other Nations
squadrons of piquers with some rankes of halbards with
in their piques: which different vses of Nations haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
me occasion not onely to enter into imagination of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:11434:51"/>
the different or contrarie causes of the forming of such
squadrons, but also the more curiouslie to aske &amp; inquire
of diuers men of great sufficiencie of those Nations, the
different reasons and causes of the forming of such squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,

I haue gathered and obserued by the diuersitie of their
opinions concerning the same, as also by mine own sight

my foresaid squadron formed with short weapons, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned

and know that all the whole squadron consisting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of piquers, according as I haue before formed diuers
squadrons in this discourse; that not aboue 5. rankes of
the foremost piques at the most beeing closed in frunt,
flankes and backe, or rather but 4. rankes, can make head
with the pointes of their piques to hurt or reach the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
or men of the formost ranks of the Launces charging;
&amp; that because the longest piques that are in these daies
vsed by any Nation are not aboue 18. foot long, of which
length of 18. foot,<note place="margin">Not aboue 5. ranks of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers closed in frunt, flanke &amp; backe, are able to make heade with their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, to reache or hitt the first ranke of Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces charginge, for diuers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> the formost ranke of piquers either
clapping the butendes of their piques vnder their right
feete, or carrying them breast high to resist, and repulse
the Launces (both which waies are in the beginning of
this booke, very particularlie declared) I say that from
their right handes that they hold the butendes of their
piques withall to theirleft and forehands that doo beare
their piques (incase they carry them abouehand breast
high) doo occupie and therefore shorten 3. foot at least
of the length of their piques towards the foremost ranke

of their Enemies; then there doo remaine 15. foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their left and forehandes more for them to reach
and annoy their enemies withall; then the second ranke
closing themselues to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> first rank and carying their piques
breast high ouer the shoulders of the first rank do leese 3.

there remaineth but 12. foot of the length of their piques
beyond the foremost rankes towardes the annoiance of
their Enemies; then the third ranke closing themselues
to the shoulders of the second ranke doo come likewise
to loose three foote more by so much of their piques as
they hold betwixt both their handes as aforesaid, which
with the thicknesse and distance of the two rankes before
them dooth come to make them to leese 9. foote of the
length of their piques, so as there remaineth only 9. foot
of the length of their piques at the most beyond the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

the fourth ranke by the like cause and reason commeth
to leese 3. foot more of the length of their piques, so as
there remaineth only 6. foot of the length of their piques
with the pointes of them before the formost ranke to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy

piquers commeth by the like causes and reasons as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide
to leese 3. foote more at the least of the length of
their piques, which with the thicknesse of all the 4. ranks
before them doo come to make them to leese 15. foot or
more of the length of their piques so as there remaineth
only 3. foot of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> length of their piques beyond y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> formost
and first ranke, the which 3. foot of their piques towards
the Enemie reaching too short to annoy either horses or
men, doo rather through the shortnesse of the same, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
so little a waie beyond the first ranke, trouble the
foremost rankes of their fellowes, then worke any other
good effect; and therefore those piques of the fifth ranke
are rather to be kept still vprighted with the points some
thing bent towardes the Enemie, then any waies to bee
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:11434:52"/>
couched as the piques of the 4. foremost rankes are, and
so likewise the piquers of the sixth, seuenth, and eighth
rankes, and subsequently of all the rest hauing no possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
at the first charge either of horsemen, or footmen, to

the pointes something bent forward towardes the

and easilie succour and supplie the places of such
piquers of the fore rankes as come to be slaine, wounded,
or ouerthrowne, and so resist or repulse either horsemen

booke haue particularly set downe.</p>
            <p>Therevnto I answere,<note place="margin">An Obiection answered.</note> that the piques that are in the
backer rankes vppon the accidentall breaking in of any
men at Armes into the foremost ranks of piquers; or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the entring of any of the formost ranks of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
squadron of footmen; are through the hauing of so
many other ranks of piquers before them, with the great
length of those weapons in a presse so vnmaniable, and
therefore of so little effect when battles come to ioine;
that most of the piques of the inner rankes; I meane of
the sixt, seuenth, and eighth, and so consequentlie of the
rest of the middle rankes, through the letting fall of the
pointes of their piques forward (how leisurely soeuer) to
couch and bend the points of them to the annoiance of
the enemies, do through their great length so intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
and intricate with the pique<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of the former rankes,
that euery sudden touch of the piques that are in the
ranks before one another, do so disorder, beat, and turne
aside the points of the piques from their intended thrusts
at their enemies, as that they rather turne them through
their great length to the trouble of the ranks before them,
then any waies to resist, repulse, or annoie the Enemie.</p>
            <p>But now it may be demanded of me wherfore the sixt,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:11434:53"/>
seuenth,<note place="margin">Why the sixth, seuenth, and so consequentlie, the rest of the inner rankes can not as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly let fall &amp; couch their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques to the mis chiefe of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as the 5 formost rankes.</note> and so consequentlie the rest of the inner rankes
should not as orderlie one after another let fal and couch
their piques to the resistance and mischiefe of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as the 5. formost, and first rank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of piquers may.
Wherevnto I answer that the 4. or 5. first rankes hauing
apparant and cleare in their eies and sights the comming
of their Enemies in squadron, be they horsemen or foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
may with greater order and leisure all one after
another couch their piques and charge a contrary
squadron of footmen, or receiue a charge of horsemen,
then the other inner rankes of piquers can, who vpon the
breaking in and entring of some of the men at armes in
one place or other, or y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> entring of some part of the squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of their enemies footmen more in one place then in
another, as sometimes it happeneth, cannot so well and
clearely see the comming and entring of their Enemies,
by reason of so many ranks of their fellowes before them,
as that they may so wel in iust and conuenient times, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and distances, orderlie and effectually let fall and
couch their piques as the 4. or 5. foremost rankes haue
doone.</p>
            <p>Vpon which accidentes it dooth ordinarilie happen,
that such inner ranks are driuen to let fall and couch their
piques vpon suddens, least y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by their not couching them,
they should by their enemies approching them too neer
leese the vse of the points of their piques. Which sudden
letting fall and couching of their piques, dooth cause the
aforesaid intermingling and intricating, and confused o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwarting
of piques with piques, a great deale more
in the inner rankes, then any waies in the formost 4. or 5.
rankes as aforesaid. By all which it is to bee considered
and noted, that neither horsmen, Launces, nor footmen
piquers can enter vnder the points of my squadron of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleaxes
empaled and inuironed in frunt, flanks and back,
with 5. ranks of piques as aforesaid, but that they must of
necessitie abide the first violence of the pointes of them,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they find them already in great order and leisure
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:11434:53"/>
couched to resist and repulse them.</p>
            <p>Whereas farre otherwise it doth behooue the inner ranks
of a squadron consisting all of piquers, to obserue the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
of their Enemies be they horsemen or footmen in
such moments &amp; iust distances, as that they may be sure
to let fall and couch their piques, when their Enemies are
entred, and do come within 4. or 5. ranks of them; which
if they should faile to performe; then it were too late for
such inner rankes to couch their piques either againste
horsemen or footmen, now entred and comne within and
vnder the length of their piques. But vnto this, some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
soldior may obiect and say, that the inner rankes
may still carrie their piques couched, readie to resist, or
repulse their Enemies entering. Or otherwise, that they
letting fal and couching their piques, after that their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
be entered within lesse then 5. or 4. rankes of them
may so farre retire, and pull them backe, as that they may
recouer the vse of the points of them against their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to their great annoiance.</p>
            <p>Vnto which obiections, I say that it is not in the force
and strength of the most puissant soldiors of any Nation
that liue,<note place="margin">An obiection aunswered.</note> still to carrie their piques couched, no nor yet
to beare them abouehand ouer their fellowes heades but
a verie little while, considering the great length and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
of them: And therefore they must neuer let fall and
couch them, vntill such instant &amp; needfull times, as their
Enemies do approach them in so neare distances, as they
must presently (either with one entire thrush, if they bee
the formost, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or. 5. rankes, or with diuers thrusts in iust
instantes and times if they be the inner rankes), vpon the
entering of the Enemie, be driuen to make head, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor
the rankes before them; for if the inner rankes should
through lacke of skill thrust at their Euemies before they
come within the reach of their piques, then they should
worke no other effect, but thrust their owne fellowes that
are betwixt them and their Enemies, to their trouble, or
mischiefe in their heads, necks or backs. And for aunswer
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:11434:54"/>
to the other obiection that the ynner rankes of piquers
letting fall and couching their piques, may pul and retire
them so farre backe, as that they may againe recouer the
vse of the points of them against their Enemies entered; I
say, that if the enemies be they either horsemen or foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
be entered but only .7. 6. 5. 4. or 3. feete within and
vnder the length of any of the piques of the inner ranks
that it is not possible for such piquers, in respect of the
ranke and rankes that are so neare and close behind them,
to pull their piques with their armes so farre backe, as any
waies to recouer y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vse of the pyonts of them against such
Enemies as are comne within and vnder their piques as
aforsaid: whereof insueth that those inner rankes haue
vtterly lost the vse of their piques, and therefore must let
them fall to the great trouble of the leggs and feete of the
rankes of their fellowes aduauncing forward, and betake
themselues to their swords and daggars,<note place="margin">The great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that a squa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dron of Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes, enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about with 5. rankes of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers do work.</note> which are not

with another, by reason of their shortnesse, as the rankes
of piques do, through their great lengthes: which piques
doo no waies kill nor hurt but only with their pointes, as
is before at large declared. By all which I come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that 4. or 5. of the first rankes, be it in frunt, flanks,
or backe; I meane which of them soeuer vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the enemie be made frunt; doo worke far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
effectes then all the rest of the inner rankes of piquers
can possibly do: for in troth, all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> inner ranks of piquers
besides the 5. first ranks, doo neither against horsemen,
and chieflie against footemen halbarders, or battleaxes
well armed; no nor yet against armed men with swordes
and targets, vsing their targets only to defend their faces
from the points of the piques, worke any important ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as it is most manifest by the reasons, causes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
by me before alledged.</p>
            <p>And thus hauing at large shewed by diuers reasons
the imperfections of squadrons that doo consist onelie
of piques, with the great perfections and effects of squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of battleaxes enuironed onely with 5. rankes of
piquers; as also howe all sortes of squadrons that are
commonlie in vse in the open fieldes in these daies, and
also in al former ages ought to be reduced into form, with
many other different particularities; I will omit diuers
other sorts &amp; forms of little battles that are conteined in
som printed books of diuers languages; as of Crossebat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
of battles in triangle, &amp; battles in form of stars, with
many other such battles of diuers shapes &amp; fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,

phantastical battles are no waies able in the open fields to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:11434:55"/>
march &amp; encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter with such squadrons as I haue before
described and set down: And yet somtimes armies may
march vpon such strange &amp; extraordinary grounds (as in
marching ouer mountains or high hils y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> haue varietie of
forms of rising &amp; descending grounds) y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it is not possible
to form such great squadrons in such forms, as I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
declared and described, but that vpon the comming
of the enemie they must bee forced to deuide their three
battles of vauntguard, battle and Rereward, that they
marched withall in the plaine and open fieldes, into as
many varieties of little battles and formes, as the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
and formes of the varietie of groundes where they
presently find themselues doo present vnto them; and
therewithall to flank their armed men on euery side with
weapons of volee: All which a Lord Marshall or serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Maior may with a great deale more facilitie perform,
then to forme such great squadrons as I haue before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
reduced, and formed.</p>
            <p>But heere I thinke it good to aduertise the Reader,
that I haue heard verie crediblie reported, that there is
another kind of forming of a battle, amongst some of the
Sergeants Maiors of our Nation in these daies greatly in
vse, and that is; That they place foure piquers with their
piques aduaunced in square, according to the greatnesse
of the squadron that they meane by guesse to form with
the number of piquers that they haue for that purpose:
And somtimes they place in the middest of the frunt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two formost piquers, a third piquer, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they place two other piquers, vpon the midst of ech
flanke one, betwixt the said piquers that are in flanke,
with a fourth piquer also in the midst betwixt the two hin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dermost
piquers, which 8. piquers when they haue pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in as iust square in their distaunces as they can: then
they command al the piquers that they meane by guesse
to reduce into squadron, beeing all behind and in Rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the 8. piquers in square, presentlie to run into the
void place within the square of the 8. piquers, and there
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:11434:55"/>
to fall into their rankes with hubbledeshuf as well as they
can, vntill they haue filled vp all the distances and empty
place within y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> square of the said 8: piquers, which being
performed; they hold this way not only for a verie ready
forming of a squadron, but also for a most excellent waie

a squadron; which kind of forming, or rather deforming
of squadrons, in troth is called of all antiquitie to make a
squadron or battle of extremitie and necessity; when vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the sudden and vnlooked for approch and neare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the enemie, through the fault and negligence
of the scouts &amp; discouerers, they are forced in the place
of assemblie in their Campe, to make of necessitie ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
that is, for lacke of time to reduce their squadrons
into forme of like numbers of souldiors in euery ranke,
and into their iust and proportionate distances both by
frunt &amp; flanks according to discipline, to form a confused
squadron of different numbers of soldiors into crooked
ranks, and vncerten and confused distances, into the void
ground or place that is within 4. 8. or 12. or more pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers,
placed in square as abouesaid, in the place of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of their Campe: which kind of disordered battles
of extremitie are no waies able by any reason Military, to
encounter and abide the charge of a squadron of the like
number of piquers reduced into forme according to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;
that is of like numbers of soldiors in euerie ranke
from frunt to backe, and in their euen and proportionate
distances in frunt, and by flankes; and therefore being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ready with great order and facilitie to incorporate

any waies troubling the one the other, nor intricating
their piques nor rankes, mannage and vse their piques
with great dexteritie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and charge, and ouerthrow, such
a confused multitude, or battle of extremitie that are in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:11434:56"/>
vncerten numbers in their ranks, and in as vncerten and
confused distances: which causeth disequality and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
of rankes; and therefore cannot possibly close
themselues in frunt and by flankes, in any order, forme,
and strength, nor mannage and vse their piques without
confounding and intricating their piques with their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
piques, to the great aduantage of their enemies
well formed squadron, and their own most certen ruine;
Besides all which it is not possible for such a disordered
squadron to march in the fields, with any order, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to discipline to performe diuers other effectes
belonging to well ordered squadrons in the fielde, as all
skilful and expert Sergeants Maiors, and men of warre of

I come to conclude that such disordered battles of

a suddaine and vnlooked for comming of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
through the negligence of the scoutes, discouerers,

certen apassionate Gentlemen with many malicious and

downe a part of that which is conteined in my foresaid

reasons and examples, as any man that is of any discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may manifestlie see the great ignorance and lacke of

of piquers and of weapons of volee may be assoon

these following.</p>
               <p>When the great Princes of Germanie vppon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
or iniury offred, are disposed to make Warre one
against another, or vpon an imperiall army assembled to
inuade or resist the Turk, beeing bounde as they are by
their Tenures Militarie to the Empire, some to finde
Horsemen,<note place="margin">The causes and reasons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Princes of Germanie doe vse great bandes of 500, in their seruice of the Empire.</note> and others to finde footemen at their owne
charges, they then vppon such occasions haue alwaies
vsed, and doo still vse to forme their Regiments of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
into great bands of 500. to an Ensigne, &amp; that they
vse especiallie for two causes; the one thereby in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimentes
and so consequentlie in their whole Armies to
saue the pay of a great sort of Captaines, Lieutenantes
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:11434:57"/>
of bands, Ensignbearers and other officers, which would
be greatly increased &amp; so amount to a far greater charge,
and pay, incase they should compose smaller bandes of
200. or 150. or vnder that number.</p>
               <p>The other cause that doth moue them to forme their
bands so great, is, that their <hi>Militia</hi> consisting of harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers,
mosquetiers, piquers, and some halbarders, with
a few slathe swords for the guard of their Ensignes, that
those sorts of weapons by reason of the greatnesse of the
bands being in great compertiments and diuisions may
be the more readilie and easilie drawne out, and sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and with a great deale more celeritie incorporated
with the other great compertimentes of like weapons of
other great bands to forme their squadrons with sleeues,
winges, troupes, and forlorne hopes, according to the
order and direction of their Coronels, and Sergeantes
Maiors, then if their bands were smaller either of 200.
or 150. or vnder that number, whereby the Comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of weapons should be also the smaller, and therby
in number the greater, and so consequently, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a much longer time not only to drawe out, but also
to incorporate compertimentes with compertimentes
for the forming of battles with sleeues, winges, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne
hopes as aforesaid: Besides that, such great bands
both by reason and experience are as readie, and a great
deale more ready to bee emploied either in whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
vnder their Captains and Lieutenants, or deuided
into partes and corporalates vnder their Corporals and
Sergeants, for watches, bodies of watches, Centinels,
and all other ordinarie and extraordinary emploiments
and actions militarie, in Campe, Towne, or field, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
smal bands are: For it is most euident that smal bands
of 150. to an Ensigne, consisting of 5. different sortes of
weapons, (viz:) piques, battleaxes, mosquets, harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buzes,
and longbowes, and that therefore euery one sort
of those weapons is to be reduced into diuers little diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by themselues, which besides the vncomely sight to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:11434:57"/>
see so many small compertimentes in euery such little
band, it would require a much longer time vpon the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and ordinarie dislodging of an Armie reduced into a
vaungard, battle and rereward, to draw so great numbers
of compertiments out of such a number of little bandes;
then out of a few bands of 500. to draw a few great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiments,
and to incorporate and reduce them into
any forme or formes.</p>
               <p>And this before written, I thinke, might suffice to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
any that do professe Armes, that are of any discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
although but of meane iudgement in matters Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie,
that such great bands as aforesaid, are a great deale
more fitt and conuenient to forme battles and squadrons
withall, then such small bands as aforesaid are. Howbeit
because there be some 3. or 4. of our Nation y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in certen lewde and false pamphlets and libells against
me (as is before mentioned) that haue not bene ashamed
to name themselues the inuentors and deuisers of a new
discipline Militarie, (who how farre wide they are from
the vnderstanding of all true discipline, all men of right
consideration may euidently see by their writinges,
speakings, vaine opinions and actions); that they I say, in
their malitious and friuolous libels do write (as aforesaid)
that small bands of 150. are as readie to be reduced into
any squadron, as great bands of .500. are. I therefore to
make that, which I haue before written more apparant,
and vtterlie to conuince their obstinate ignorances, will
by comparing the best orders and waies of fourming of
squadrons, both with great, and with small bandes, shewe
with what great readines and facilitie, squadrons may be
formed with a few great Compertiments out of great
bandes of. 500. to an Ensigne; and with what difficultie
great squadrons are reduced into forme, with many little
Compertiments out of small bandes of .150. to an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe:
that therby all men of consideration may euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
see the erronious and vnskilfull opinions Militarie that
those our such men of warre do hold: And therefore I do
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:11434:58"/>
for example alledge: That admit that a generall of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

horsemen of diuers armors and weapons, with all other
prouision and furniture belonging to such an Armie, to
inuade some forren dominions; &amp; that the whole 18000
footmen being deuided into 5. partes he had concluded
(according to the commendable opinion of some nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men of warre that I haue knowne in my time) that. 3.
parts of the 5. should be all piquers and short weapons, or
all piquers without any short weapons, to forme a vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
battle and Rereward, according to the manner and
vse of the Italians and Spaniards of this time; and that the
other two parts should be all weapons of volee; weare I
say, determined to make a proofe, whether little bandes
of 150. or great bands of 500. were most apte and ready
to forme squadrons withal; and therefore hauing reduced
3. of the 6. Regiments into little bands of 150. that is 20.
bandes of 150. to euerie Regiment of 3000. and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
3. Regiments into great bandes of .500. that is .6.
bandes of 500. to euerie Regiment of 3000. he then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
these or the like directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hereafter set down, should
most manifestly see the great aptnes, dexteritie and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of great bandes of .500. to reduce squadrons into,
with the wonderfull vnreadinesse, great disorders and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
in reducing of squadrons into forme by little

               <p>The Lieutennant general therfore first to make proofe
whether the piquers of one of the regiments of the small
bands, or the piquers of one of the Regiments of the great
bands were more readie to be reduced into squadron, is
to commaund that at a certen houre vpon a sound and
warning giuen by his trompettor, two Coronells with
their two Regiments the one consisting all of small bands
of .150. and the other all of great bands of .500. should
with all celeritie reduce themselues into their simple and

is that the Captains and officers of the 3. first bands that

doo reduce all their weapons of volee that are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

meet: And that the said seuerall compertiments of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one of those three bands being led by their Conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
shall march and follow one another: And that al the
piquers of the 6. whole bandes be reduced into 6. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiments
of 10. in euery ranke from frunt to back, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
vpon the sound of the drums to follow the comper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of weapons of volee; As also beeing distinctlie
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:11434:60"/>
led by their Captaines to march and follow one another:
And then that the three compertiments of weapons of

               <p>Al which reducementes into their simple or single

sounds of the drummes, or of the Coronels trompettor,
they are presentlie to march out at that Sallie, turnpique,
or barriers of the camp, that it hath before pleased y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,

compertiments of weapons of volee being comne
neere to the place where the squadron is to bee formed,
they are presently to march to the right flanke and side of
the same place, &amp; there to reduce themselues into as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

direction: At which instant, the first compertiment
of 30. ranks of piquers 10. in a rank, doo march vp to the
place of reducement, whither being comn, vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sound
of the drums for that purpose, they are presently to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance

instant the second compertiment, and the third comper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
both of like numbers of 10. piquers in euery one
ranke from frunt to back, do march vp the second by the
right flanke of the first compertiment that hath alreadie
made a pause or stand, and the thirde by the left flanke of
the said first compertiment: At which time and instant
also the fourth compertiment dooth march vppe by the

               <p>And the sixt or last compertiment by the right flanke

last rankes of the said first compertiment. During which
time and instant of the reducement of the said 6. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiments
of piquers into squadron, the three last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertimentes
of weapons of volee doo march vp by the

and there are to reduce themselues into the like

Or otherwise as it shall please the Coronell or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant
Maior to giue direction, for the arming of the said
left flanke and back of the aforesaid piquers.</p>
               <p>And now this squadron being by this kind of reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
reduced into forme, with sleeues, winges, troups,
and other formes of weapons of volee, with great readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and celeritie; al men of consideration may euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
see, with what great facilitie and dexteritie a few great
compertiments of piquers and halbardiers for the guard
of the Ensignes, out of great bands of 500. are reduced
into squadron of 60. souldiors in frunt and 30. rankes
by flanke, or into any other farre greater squadron, with
weapons of volee reduced into diuers formes to arme,
the frunt, flankes and backe, according to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of the Generall, or Coronell, or Sergeant
Maior.</p>
               <p>But now let vs see how the other aforsaid regiment of
3000. deuided into small bandes of hundreds and fifties,
(according to the contrarie opinion) three parts of them
piquers, and the other two partes weapons of volee (as
aforesaid) may with most celeritie be reduced into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> like
squadron of 1800. piquers before set downe; that is, 60.
in frunt, and 30 by flanks: I say that to form that squadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
each one of the 20. Captaines must according to all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and discipline, first reduce their bandes vnder their
Ensignes into their simple and single order of rankes, as
also into their different compertiments, as the great ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
before haue doone.</p>
               <p>And because that they may the more readily forme the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:11434:61"/>
squadron, it will behooue them to haue speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the number of 60. souldiors that their squadron
must conteine in euery ranke from frunt to backe, as also
that there must be 30. ranks by flankes: which beeing by
them considered, they then must reduce all the piquers
of euerie one of their bandes into such numbers of ranks,
as that they may be by flank, in equall numbers of ranks
with the squadron that they intend to forme of 30. ranks:
which to accomplish, they must reduce their comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of piquers of each one of their bandes into 30.
rankes of 3. in a ranke: which number being 3. partes of
the 5. parts of each one of their bands as aforesaid; doth
amount iust to 90. piquers; the other two partes consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of weapons of volee beeing 60. So as they must
forme their squadron with the compertiments of 90. pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers,
3. in euery ranke, as the great bandes did forme
their squadrons with compertiments of 300. piquers 10
in euery ranke, which to perform, (considering that they
are 20. compertiments of 90. piquers to euery comper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,
out of 20 little bands, as the compertiments of
the great bandes were but only 6. compertiments of 300
piquers to euery compertiment, out of the 6. great bands
of 500. to euerie band) will require 3. or 4. times longer
time, then to reduce them into squadron by the 6. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiments
of the great bandes as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>Or incase that the Coronell would giue order that
those little bands being reduced into their simple and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
order of.3.<note place="margin">Diuers disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and confu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sions that doe ensue in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons with litle comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of bands of 150.</note> in euerie ranke throughout euerie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiment

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiments
of piquers out of 3. or 4: little bandes, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby to forme the squadron with greater celeritie:
They I say shall first before they bring that to passe, finde
themselues greatly confused to forme the same, by their
seeing so great a number of little bandes dispersed ouer
the place of Armes, which do occupy a great deale more
ground in the said place, then 6. great bands do: Besides
that it will require a double, or rather a treble time more,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:11434:61"/>
first to reduce 20 little bandes into their simple and single
order of ranks, and little Compertiments of so many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
sorts of weapons in so many places dispersed: and
then to drawe out and to incorporate such a number of
small Compertiments one with another, and after to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them into one bodie of squadron as aforesaid, then
only with 6. greate Compertiments of piquers to forme
the like squadron, &amp; to arme the same with many formes
of different sorts of weapons of volee in frunt, flankes and
backe. By all which alleadged both <hi>Pro et contra,</hi> as also
performed in the sight and presence of such a generall as
aforesaid, I thinke it would be euident vnto him, and to
all other men of consideration and Iudgement in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
that this little squadron formed but of. 1800<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers,
is a great deale sooner and with more facilitie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with the Compertiments of a few great bandes,
then with a great number of little Compertiments, out
of many little bandes as aforesaid: which if it be so in so
small a squadron where the little Compertiments of 90.
piquers marching 3. in a ranke doo beare length in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of rankes by flankes to forme such a little battle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
patching and peecing so many little compertiments
to forme the squadron withall: what then if the Generall
should command the Coronels and Sergeants Maiors
of 2. of the 3. Regiments of those little bands to reduce al
the piquers that according to the former diuision doo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
vnto 3600. piquers, into a squadron on of 90. piquers
in frunt, and 40. rankes by flanke? when that to perform
the same, they must not onlie first of all reduce euery one
of their little bands into their simple, and single order of
ranks of 3. or 4. or more in euerie ranke; but because that
their compertime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of 30. ranks 3. in euerie ranke are too
short by 10. rankes to make 40. rankes, they must not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incorporate themselues by flankes with the like nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of rankes; but also must with pieces of other bandes,
patch and piece their incorporated Compertiments, and
after the patching and pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:11434:62"/>
forme their squadron: which to performe doth require
a verie long time, and doth greatlie confuse &amp; confound
the Coronels and Sergeants Maiors, and al the rest of the
officers of those Regiments to their great disgrace and
reproach: wheras contrariwise the 3600. piquers of the. 2
Regiments of 6000. that do consist but of 12. great bands
being in the place of Armes reduced into 10. Comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of 9. piquers in euerie ranke, in each Comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from frunt to backe, are with great facilitie, &amp; with
out any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion to be reduced, by doubling themselues
by flanke, or flankes as aforesaid into the aforesaid squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of 90. piquers in frunt, and 40. rankes by flankes:
which being so, as by all reason and practise Military it is,
then if the Generall should giue furder order to the three
Coronels or Sergeants Maiors of al the three Regiments
of 9000. that do consist of little bands (as aforesaid) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
al their piquers, which according to the proportion

besides the other two partes that are weapons of
volee, into one bodie of squadron of 108. piquers in frunt
and of 50. rankes by flanke: how wonderfully then would
the Sergeants Maiors &amp; officers of those Regiments find
themselues confused to forme so great a squadron of the
peeces and patches (as they may be well termed) of. 60.
little bandes; when euery one of those single Comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
do not only lacke number in frunt to make conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient

celeritie; but also are a great deale too short by flankes to
forme the aforesaid squadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in number of ranks by flanks
and therefore must of necessitie, not only incorporate a
great number of little Compertiments, and peeces of
compertime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with other little compertiments by flanks
therby to make them to come to the iust number in frunt
of 108. piquers; but also must peece and patch euery one
of those Compertiments with the peeces of other little
Compertiments in backe or Rereward, thereby after to
reduce, forme, and being their squadron by flankes to

dooth cause so great a disorder and confusion in the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
executing of the directions of the Coronelles and
Sergeants Maiors, as it is neuer to make an end: whereof
insueth great noises and rumors, by calling, by swearing,
by commaunding and countermaunding, and by this
and by that.</p>
               <p>Wheras contrariwise, the compertiments of piquers
of the other three Regiments of great bandes of 500. as
aforsaid, consisting of 300. piquers to euerie comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may with great dexteritie, quietnesse and facilitie,
without the aforesaid peecing and patching of comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with compertiments form the aforesaid squadron

               <p>All which 18. compertimentes of 300. piquers to

(according vnto any of the orders that I haue before ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

squadron of 108. piquers in euery ranke from frunt to

consisteth of 5400. piquers as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>And this dexteritie and facilitie of forming of great
squadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s without any disorder or confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth proceed
of the great compertiments that are drawne out of great
bands: whereas farre otherwise, to forme the same saide
squadron with 60. compertiments of 90 piquers, 3. in a
ranke in euery compertiment, drawne out of 60. little
bandes of 150.<note place="margin">Diuers confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that doe ensue of many little comperti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers.</note> to euery Ensigne, to the intent to forme
the said squadron: the Captaines and officers after that
they haue reduced euery one of their bandes into their
simple and single order of ranks, (which is the first thing
for all seruices in the field that according to al discipline
ought to be performed) must then because their litle com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pertiments
of 90. piquers doo consist but of 30. ranks, 3.
in a ranke, go and find another compertiment of the like
number of another band to ioine with them by flanke,
thereby to make their compertiment of 6. in euery rank.
But because their two compertiments incorporated by
flankes as aforesaid, doo lacke 20. rankes of 6. in euerie
ranke to make the iust length of the squadron by flanke
that consisteth of 50. rankes: Another Captaine must
bring his whole compertiment of 90. piquers, which do
consist of 15. rankes 6. in a ranke, and ioine them at the
backe of the other two compertiments; and yet those 3.
Captaines must borrowe out of another compertiment
of a fourth band 5. rankes more of 6. in a ranke, which
are 30. piquers to make out the full number of 50. ranks,
6. in euery ranke; so as the fourth Captain that hath lent
30. piquers, dooth remaine but with a peece of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiment
of 60. piquers, with the which he must after
incorporate, and peece and patch other compertiments
either to make length by flanke, or bredth in frunt. And

doo insue in forming of a squadron of piquers with

great or greater confusions in reducing a farre greater
number of little compertimentes of weapons of volee,
that do consist of three different sorts of weapons, as of
Archers, mosquetiers and harquebuziers, into diuers
formes and emploiments; All which reducementes of
squadrons into forme with sleeues, winges, troups, and
forlorne hopes of weapons of volee, and other such like
doo require fower or fiue times longer time to performe,

of volee out of bandes of 500. to reduce such great
squadrons into forme as aforesaid with sleeues, winges,
forlorne hopes, &amp;c. of weapons of volee, as all men that
are not obstinatelie ignorant may by that which I haue
before declared most manifestlie see.</p>
               <p>The testimonie and proofe whereof was euidentlie
seene at such time as there were certen great squadrons
formed, or rather with great disorder, trouble, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
wonderfullie deformed heere in Essex the yeare
1588. Which proceeded of nothing so much as of the
lacke of vnderstanding of such as should haue reduced
the whole Armie into great bandes of 500. to euery En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
with conuenient and well sorted compertimentes,
or of 400. or of 300. to euerie Ensigne at the fewest.
Whereas farre otherwise, the bands of the whole Armie
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:11434:64"/>
did consist of diuers different numbers, as of 150. of 200
of 300. of 400. of 500. and of 600. to an ensigne, and in
all those bands, the compertimentes of the different sorts
of weapons were so ill sorted, and in so great dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the same with the lacke of skill of such as should
haue reformed those imperfections, were the very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that when they went about to reduce and forme any
squadron with sleeues, wing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, &amp;c: they fell into manie
errors and confusions, as all those that were there of any
vnderstanding in matters militarie might euidentlie see.
Vppon all which reasons and examples of reducing of
great and small bands into squadrons with so many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
confusions, and failings as are incident and
doo ordinarilie ensue in reducing of little comperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of small bandes into diuers formes of squadrons
with sleeues, winges, forlorne hopes, &amp;c, with the great
perfections and easinesse of reducing the great comper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timentes
of great bandes into all sortes of formes with
great facilitie as is before declared, considered; I come to
conclude that the aforesaid Lieutenant Generall, or any
other Chiefetaine of right vnderstanding, obseruation
and iudgement, would forme the footmen of his Armie

much to differ, yet their differences are so great, as they
are to be obserued by al skilfull leaders and conductors
of harquebuziers, and by the soldiors themselues.</p>
               <p>Of the which 4. the first is vpon some occasions to

selues into small societies either of 3. or else of 4. harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers
to second and supplie one anothers place: and
that is to be vnderstood in this sort: Incase that they doo
deuide themselues into societies of threes, then haue
they but onely three dischargings, and that is when the
formost soldior hath in trauessing his grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; with good
aduisement discharged at the enemy, and trauessing his
grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d doth retire behind his fellowes to charge again; y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> second harquebuzier should aduance forward to
espie som aduantage to discharge his harquebuze, not in
hast at the aire, but with leisure at his enemie that hee es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieth
standing still or in slow motion; which when hee
hath performed, and trauessing his ground, he dooth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire:
then the third harquebuzier aduauncing forward
and trauessing his ground should with good aduisement
discharge his peece at the enemie that he espieth stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
still or in slow motion, whilest the other two har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers
his companions, before retired doo charge
againe: which by him performed, then he is to trauesse
his ground and to begin againe to charge, retiring bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
and somthing wide of the hindermost of the three.
And by this kind of loose skirmishing of many societies
of threes dispersed in the field,<note place="margin">The commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that ensue to harquebuzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by this first way of skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing.</note> the formost of euery three

his ground, and espying when to discharge his peece ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuallie
(as aforesaid) dooth giue time and leisure, to
the other two of his societie retired behind, to charge
their peeces againe: But because that the chiefe effect of
harquebuziers in skirmish dooth consist principallie in
three thinges;<note place="margin">Three princi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pall waies wherein the chiefe effects of harquebuzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in skirmish do consist.</note> that is, in the well charging of their pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which cannot be well performed without conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time and leisure; the second, in leisurely discharging,
although not from steady and firm point at blank; which
can be seldome performed at men, or by men in motion;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:11434:67"/>
and therefore they are to take their sights at the endes of
their peeces, at such their enemies as are in slowest moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so make the best point and blanke that they may
by guesse from the endes of their peeces.</p>
               <p>And the third which is of no lesse importance then the
former two is; that harquebuziers doo not discharge
their peeces at the enemy out of conuenient distances;
for if they doo, then how well soeuer they haue charged
their peeces, and with what leisure and aduisement soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they doo discharge the same at men in motion, they
doo worke verie little or no effect, as well in respect that
no harquebuziers howe good soeuer they bee, can take
their sightes so certenlie from point at blanke in a great
distance, as they may in a much nearer distance; as also
that they can a great deale lesse take their sights from the
ends of their peeces at their enemies in motion a great
distance off, although it be within the points and blankes
of their peeces: besides many other causes and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities

of volee may be of 4. harquebuziers all at one time, and

which was into the forme of hearses, which hearses
were broad in frunt, and narrow short by flankes, which
is to be vnderstood, of many soldiors in euery ranke; and
but of fewe rankes by flankes; in such sorte, as what nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:11434:75"/>
soeuer of archers they placed in frunte, that is in euery
ranke, the archers by flanke did neuer exceed the nomber
of 7. or 8. rankes at the most; And the causes and reasons
were these: that the archers being reduced into their hearse
or hearses, as also into their conuenient distaunces in frunt
and by flankes, euery one of them without any trouble
through the too much nearenes of their fellowes in the
same ranke, or by the ouermuch nearenes of the ranke &amp;
ranks before them, might, without any impediment shoot
and roue of any mean height at their enemies being either
horsemen or footmen, ouer the heads of the rank or ranks
before them; and therewithall that the hindersmost ranks,
(being so few by flanks as aforesaid) might the more easily
see their Enemies that they shoot at: As also that by the
fewnesse of their rankes, the hindermost ranke and rankes
being the nearer to their Enemies, should the more easilie
reach their Enemies with their volees of arrowes; whereas
otherwise if the rankes were many, then by the ouerplura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of rankes the hinder rankes should be depriued of the
sight of their Enemies that they should shoot at, and also
should be driuen to shoot their arrows at their enemies too
high a compasse, and by such meanes worke the lesse effect
against their enemies.</p>
               <p>All which considered,<note place="margin">How to reduce archers into Hearses.</note> I thought good in this place to
shew how any number of archers should be reduced into
the forme of a hearse, or diuers hearses, which is a thing of
great facilitie to be performed, because that the Captaine
or Captaines of archers haue no more to do but to say vnto
their archers. <hi>Ranke your selues archers. 7. in a ranke</hi> or if
they will make a hearse of 8. rankes, <hi>then ranke your selues</hi> 8
<hi>in a ranke,</hi> (as in the first part of this my booke concerning
the reducing of single bandes into rankes, is verie particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly
contained); which being by the archers performed
thrughout the whole band, or as manie bands of archers as
they will bring into a hearse; then their Captaines and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors
are to lead them by the flanke and corner of the
squadron where those archers shall be reduced into winge;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:11434:76"/>
and there drawing those archers as far out, and large from
the corner of the squadron as they shal think requisite; and
finding the hindermost ranke of 7. soldiors, or of 8. if they be
disposed to make their flanke of 8. archers, to be of such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
distance from the corner of the squadron as they
shal think meet: then the chiefe Commander of those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
is presentlie to goe to the midst of that flanke where
they are to make of flanke frunt, and then being a conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
distance from them, he ought to say vnto them: <hi>Frunt
to mee Archers, and let this worde passe throughout from
flanke to flanke:</hi> Vppon which his wordes pronounced, all
the souldiors in flanke throughout next vnto him are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie
to turne their faces and weapons towardes him and
make of flanke frunt, and so subsequentlie all the rest of the
archers throughout al the rankes must performe the like.
And this making of flank frunt may be performed aswel by
the stroke of the drumme as by the briefe speeches of the
commander: which being by them performed, then they
must presently reforme themselues into their conuenient
distances both by frunt and flanks, that thereby they may
without any impediment giue their volees as aforsaid: And
thus of a great number of ranks that they were before when
they marched in their simple or single order of rankes, as of
7. or else of 8. in a ranke from frunt to backe, they are now
become a great number of Archers in frunt; that is, in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ranke, and but onelie of 7. or else 8 rankes by flankes,
which order and forme is to be vnderstood and tearmed a
hearse of Archers; and as this hearse is now reduced into
a wing either from the right or left corners of the squadron:
so may the like winges be drawen from all 4. corners, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
vpon the frunt or flankes of the squadron, or any other
place or places where it shal please the General of the field,<note place="margin">Archers redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, are neuer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or the Lord Marshall to direct or command.</p>
               <p>But heere it is to be furder noted, that such hearses are
not to giue any volees of arrowes at their Enemies, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vppon a token or signe giuen vnto them by some chiefe
Commaunder of the hearse, who by his officers is to make
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:11434:76"/>
all the souldiors of the hearse priuie to the same signe and
token; And therefore the same Commaunder and signe
giuer is to be of good vnderstanding in archerie: as also of
the distances of groundes, that thereby he may not faile to
giue his signe when the hindermost archers are within the
reach of the former rankes of the enemies bee they horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
or footmen: for if hee should faile in the same, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Archers through the too great distance of ground
shoulde shoot short, hee should then commit a very grose
error.</p>
               <p>Also it is to bee noted that if the commander of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
doo thinke it requisite, he may deuide the deliuerie of
his archers arrowes into two volees, that is, that hee may
if the hearse doo consist of 8. rankes by flankes take order
that fower of the formost rankes shal giue their first volees,
and as the enemies doo approch neerer to giue order that
the other 4. hindermost rankes shall likewise giue their
volees altogither with the rankes before them. And as the
reducing of Archers into these aforesaide formes of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are verie conuenient and of great effect for battles: euen
so they may bee brought into diuers other formes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the scituation of the ground or grounds and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
other occasions, and likewise worke verie great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes.</p>
               <p>But now, whereas there be diuers in this time professing
Armes, that doo greatly disesteeme archers, thinking that
a farre greater number of Archers were not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with a smaller number of mosquetiers:<note place="margin">An aunswer to such as doe thinke archers inferior to mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers in the plaine field.</note> Thereunto
I say that that their opinion doth proceede of nothing else,
but of their lacke of vnderstanding and knowing the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
imperfections and failinges that do belong to mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
and mosquetiers in the field, as also of the strange and
incredible effects of archers arrowes, and therewithall that
they did neuer enter into the consideration that mosque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
are not to worke any effect in the open fieldes but from
their restes fixed in the ground, or some other accidentall
or naturall rests and themselues standing still to take some

sight from point at blanke, at their enemies when they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
which at men in motion with any certentie it is not
possible for them to performe, and if they faile in taking
their sightes at point and blanke, then their bullets do flie
straight at the Cloudes without doing any other hurt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that when they haue once discharged their first char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of full bullets, or haileshot of warre from their rests in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case
they be forced vpon the vncerten comming of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
to remoue and new place their rests and charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
their peeces are so exceeding heauie, and they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
so troubled with their rests hanging vpon their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
that they are driuen to a verie long recharging of their
mosquets againe, which recharging if it be not in such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler
sort and perfection, as I haue before set downe, the
bullets of their second volee will scarce go within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of the height of piques vprighted, or rather of younge
trees, as all skilfull soldiors that do know their wonderfull
vncerten effects in seruices of the field will confesse: so as I
com to conclude, if the trial were to be made in the open &amp;
plaine fields betwixt 1500. archers, and 3000.<note place="margin">1500. archers able to breake 3000 mosque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</note> mosquetiers

can be deuised, those. 1500. archers being reduced into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

of thirties &amp; more or fewer, and they approching &amp; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailing
the mosquetiers both in frunt and by flanks, &amp; giuing
their volees of arrowes in continuall motions at the mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers,
who if they meane to worke any effect of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
must stand still to discharge their peeces as aforesaid du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time of their standing still they shall to their
great error and mischiefe receaue the continuall volees of
the archers arrowes, vpon all parts of their bodies, in such
sort as the archers there is no doubt, being well instructed
and led in their troupes by their Captaines and other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,<note place="margin">The aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers haue of mosquetiers.</note>
would with great facilitie with a verie few volees of
arrowes breake all the mosquetiers, although they were of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:11434:77"/>
a farre greater number: For although mosquets will carrie
their bullets point and blanke a great deale furder distance
then archers are able to work any effect with their arrowes;
yet their wonderfull vncertenties (many of the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
whereof I haue in other my bookes very particulerlie
set downe) are such and so manie, as against archers redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into great numbers of troups as aforesaid, and assailing
them in motion with infinite volees of arrowes, they would
be found to be of a wonderful, &amp; incredible small resistance
against the blowes of such innumerable arrowes as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
               <p>Howbeit peraduenture some professing armes will saie, that harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers
may with a great deale more aduantage
encounter with Archers then mosquetiers,<note place="margin">Their oppinion that thinke harquebuziers of greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage to encounter with archers then mosquetiers refuted.</note> because that
harquebuziers may incounter with Archers deuided into
great numbers of societies and troupes, and therewithall
may giue their volees of bullets in motion at the archers,
aswell as the archers their volees of arrowes in motion at
them. Wherevnto I answer, that if the volees of mosque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
bullets from their rests be so vncerten at men in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as I haue before mentioned, then of necessitie the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lees
of harquebuziers, themselues discharging in motion,
at the archers likewise in motion must needs be a great deale
more vncerten: besides that if harquebuziers do discharge
9. 10. 11. or 12. skores distant at the archers, as the archers
may doo at them, it will bee found that in 10000. of their
shot they will not hit so many as 10. archers:<note place="margin">The aduaunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> archers haue of harque buziers.</note> so wonderful
vncerten by all true experience of all wel practised and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
souldiors are those weapons of fire. So as I come to
conclude also that a farre greater number of harquebuziers
are no waies able to abide the terror of a much smaller num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber
of archers, I meane if the archers bee of a thousand or
any greater number, whereby they may reduce themselues
into many formes and troupes.</p>
               <p>And now as I haue alledged diuers reasons to shew and
proue that a smaller number of archers reduced into many
greater and smaller troupes, haue great aduauntage to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:11434:78"/>
and breake a great deale greater nomber of mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers
in the plaine &amp; open fields: euen so am I perswaded
by the like causes and reasons that.<note place="margin">Reasons to proue that 500. harquebuziers are in skirmish able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw as many mosquetiers.</note> 500. harquebuziers in
the plaine and open fields reducing themselues into many
societies of loose shot, as also into greater troupes (as I haue
before in other places, whereas I haue shewed in what sort
harquebuziers should skirmish declared) were able with
great facilitie to ouerthrow and driue out of the fieldes. 500
mosquetiers; I meane, if neither the harquebuziers nor the
mosquetiers had any other weapon to succor them but
themselues, by reason that the harquebuziers being disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into many societies of loose shot, and into greater and
lesser troupes, may trauesse their grounds and inlarge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and giue their volees in continuall motion, Iauing
only at the instant when they take their sights and discharge
their peeces at the frunt, flankes and backe of the mosque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
standing still like buttes without motion at their rests
whereas mosquetiers reducing themselues into diuers
broad squares, or troupes according vnto their most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
orders of aduauntage to discharge their peeces
from their rests, cannot discharge their peeces although
with haileshot of warre at the harquebuziers to any effect,
by reason that they are dispersed, and in continuall motion.
Howbeit if any man will saie that mosquetiers might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their rests likewise reduce themselues into many little
societies, and greater and smaller troupes, and so with great
aduauntage in respect that their peeces wil carrie point and
blanke a great deale surder, then harquebuzes, skirmish with
the harquebuziers:<note place="margin">Mosquetiers are not able in skirmish to vse their peeces without rests to any effect, &amp; with restes they cannot skirmishe.</note> Thereunto it is to be aunswered, that it
is not possible that mosquitiers, although they were al men

may with dexterity discharge it steadily and with ease from
his forehand, taking his sight either from point at blanke, or
at least from the end of his peece with some kind of certen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
which if his peece be any thing too heauie for him with
facilitie &amp; ease to mannage, it is not possible for him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
although it were at a firme and steadie marke, by
reason that he striuing with all his force to beare the end of
his peece, to discharge the same with some steadinesse and
certentie, the same ouermaistring his forces with extreame
heueth, doth make him to shoot iust either at the centre of
the earth, or else at the seuen stars without dooing any hurt
to the enemie: Besides that when he hath once or twise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
to recharge againe, it dooth not onlie through the
great length and heueth of his peece require a much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
time then for a harquebuzier to recharge his harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze,
but also doth so weary the mosquetier, that it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
no effect, other then by his seldom discharging to make
a great noise. So as in this matter I come to conclude, that
as mosquetiers (as I haue in certen other places before men
tioned) through the great distance that their peeces wil ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and the great blowes that they will giue aswel with hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot
of war as with single bullets, haue in their conuenient
and due times and places great aduantage against har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers:
Euen so for skirmishes, harquebuziers for the
causes and reasons before alledged, do in their effects farre
exceed and excel mosquetiers. And thus farre concerning

by reason that if another squadron of men at

not be able with their charge to passe those 10. rankes, no
more, then the squadron of 10. ranks to passe through their
multiplicitie of ranks; which is the cause that I would make
my squadron of men at Armes or Launces broad in frunt

9. or 10. or 11. or 12. ranks at the most.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, true it is that such squadrons of Launces as do
consist of 20. 25. or 30. rankes may drawe foorth from the
backe or rereward a sleeue of 5. or of 10. ranks of Launces,
and draw them vppe by one of the flankes of the same squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,

in euerie ranke, or more or fewer, I say (that in mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
one charge of the squadron of 500. launces should not
be able to worke so great an effect to the endaungering of
the squadron of piquers as those 5. little squadrons or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
should be able to doo, seconding one another and

finding the squadron of piques in some disorder
through the charge of the. 3. first squadrons should with
great facilitie giue in amongst them &amp; ouerthrow them, or
at least, put them in great hazard of breking &amp; ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And so likewise 500. launces or stradiots or any greater
number haue a great deale greater aduauntage to charge,
disorder &amp; break in the open fields any number or numbers
of harquebuziers or mosquetiers, incase they be without
any succor of piques or aduauntage of ground in troupes of

themselues vpon the frunt of the hinder halfe of the laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

the formost halfe of the launces now making their pause
and standing still, vntill that the formost ranke of the hinder

ranke of the formost halfe of launces, and so likewise that
the hindermost ranke of the same one halfe of launces, bee
equall with the hindermost ranke of the formost one halfe
of the launces, and so consequently all the rest of the ranks
be euen and straight by flankes one with another: which
being performed then of 6. in a rank that the same band or

comne to be 12. in a ranke throughout; which being done,

captains that doe lead them, are to lead and draw the flanke
of their band or bandes to the ground whereas they will

(as aforesaid:) Euen so may the Captaines either by the

their Launces to double themselues by right line; that is,

either to charge their enemies or to receaue a charge. And
as this broad square of many Launces in frunt, and but of
12. Launces by flankes hath bene reduced into forme by
two different waies as aforsaid; so may any other squadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or
squadrons of launces be reduced by any of those two waies,
of how many rankes by flankes soeuer they are. But yet as
the reducing of horsemen by right line is verie good and
ready: so the reducing of them into squadron by flankes as
aforesaid, is better; because they do no waies alter nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
themselues in their distances neither in frunt nor by
flankes; whereas otherwise by entring and doubling their
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:11434:82"/>
rankes one into another by right line, they come to disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their proportionate distaunces, which they must again
with all speed reforme. Aduertising furder, that as this squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
hath beene formed by the aforesaid two waies, so may
the same or any other euen at the first be as well reduced by
any of those 2. waies into form, in vaungard and frunt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making of flank frunt, so as the Coronell, Sergeant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior,

haue good regard aswel to the ground and number that he
wil make his frunt of, as to the number of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ranks by flanks,
and therwithal to place and accomodat the broken rank, or

               <p>Now because in these daies new opinions and fancies in
matters of armes grounded vpon very weake or rather no
reasons at all, do beare a very great swaie; and that amongst

that launces should be rather reduced into troup to charge
or receiue a charge,<note place="margin">Launces are alwaies rather to be reduced into squadron, then into troupes.</note> then into squadron formed: I for diuers
reasons, of the which some I will after alledge, would that
when any Coronell or Captaines of men at armes or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launces
shal haue occasion to reduce their bands into form,
either to march or fight; that then they doo in any wise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them into forme of squadron, according to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent-vse,
and not into troupe according to the newe fancies,
incase that time and leisure wil serue: And therwithall that
they do form them with a triple frunt,<note place="margin">Launces are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to bee 3. times and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 4. or 5. times or more in frunt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by flankes.</note> that is three times as

if the frunt be of 24. or 25. Launces, then the flanke

at other times and vpon other occasions into farre broader
frunts then quadruple, although by flankes not aboue 10.
or 12. rankes at the most as aforesaide: and that the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dardes
or Ensignes, if they bee men at Armes; or the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
if they bee dimilaunces bee placed in the midst of the
squadron.</p>
               <p>And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> those horsmen be instructed how to inlarge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:11434:83"/>
in their rankes when they march in squadron: and
how presentlie vpon the sight of the enemie approching to
straighten themselues by frunt and flankes, with their iust
&amp; proportionate distances, in such sort as they may charge
or receiue a charge of the enemie without disordering their
horses or Launces, or confounding their ranks. But incase
that vpon a sudden Alarm giuen vppon the approch of the
Enemie the Launces being in Campe, Towne, or Village
be not reduced into their single order vnder their Ensignes
or Guidons, but that they are then assembling themselues
and the enemie neere at hand; then they must make of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
vertue, that is to reduce themselues into troupe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
as neere as they can a triple, or quatriple frunt, or more
that they may somewhat resemble a squadron, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

               <p>And whereas there be some professing armes in this time
that doo holde an opinion that Launces haue a greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
to charge or receiue a charge in troupe, then in

               <p>All which being by them performed, they should then

by the terror and thundering of their enemies horses feete

also of the aduauntages that such light horsemen haue in
such semicircles against a squadron of Launces. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to reduce them into the aforesaid formes, I say that if
therebe (for examples sake) 200. light horsemen; they are
to march 2. in a ranke either by right line or oblique: And
incase they march 2. in a ranke by right line, then euerie 2.
horsemen are of equal frunt throughout from frunt to back
as all other sortes of horsemen in their rankes are: But if
they march in ranks oblique,<note place="margin">How to reduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

likewise the midst of the distance or voide ground that is

light horsman of the third ranke; And so subsequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
all the rest of the light horsemen must march in rankes
oblique the one to the other.</p>
               <p>Now all this band of 200. light horsemen reduced into
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:11434:86"/>
100. rankes marching by right line straight forward, are to
be reduced into a semicircle in this sort following, that is,
that one Conductor ought to march before all the rankes;
And another last of all behinde all the rankes; Then after
two other Conductors are to be placed in the verie midst,
the one to take care and to see order obserued by the one
halfe of the semicircle, that is of his right hand; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to see order obserued by the other halfe of the semicir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
that is of his left hand: which conductors being so pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and the Cornet either in the midst of the rankes of the
light horsemen, or else in one of the formost rankes; then to
reduce these 100. rankes into a semicircle, either the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
or formost Conductor must march with his band &amp;
fetch a great and a large compasse and circuite of ground,
either vpon the right, or left hand, according as he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to make the frunt of his semicircle: And thus he must
leade his band in compasse and halfe circle, vntill he seeth
the hindermost ranke right ouer, and against in semicircle
to the formost ranke of all the bande, which he himselfe
leadeth: which he perceiuing, then he must commaund his
trompettor to sound a stay or pause, which done, the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettor
must gallop towards the midst of the semicircle; I
meane of the inner or compasse side, and there must againe
sound to make of flanke frunt: which being performed, then
of 100. ranks of 2. in a ranke that they were before, they are
now becomne to be only 2. rankes of. 100. in each ranke,
which being performed, then may they march in this
forme of semicircle in their rankes, either by right line or
oblique if the fields be large and open (as they are most
commonly in Fraunce, and many other Countries) with

Launces that would thinke to breake that semicircle by a

aduauntage of the semicircle is, vpon the instant and verie
beginning of the charge of the launces to open themselues
in the midst; the formost Conductor of the Corner of the
right hand galloping large and something in compasse,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:11434:86"/>
and leading the one halfe of the semicircle of light horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
vpon the one flanke of the squadron of Launces; and
the other Conductor of the other ende, or corner of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle
to galloppe likewise somewhat large in compasse,
and lead the other halfe of the semicircle to charge vppon
the other flanke of the squadron of Launces, and with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
noises and shoutes to charge both the flankes, as also
the backe of the squadron with their speares al at one time.
Or if the Semicircle bee all of stradiots, with their zagaias,
which are double headed Launces, then that they beeing

doo charge both the flanks and backe of the squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron

killing, and wounding, both horses and men.</p>
               <p>By which new, extraordinarie, and vnexpected kinde
of charge, the squadron of Launces that thought by right
line to haue charged and broken the semicircle in the midst
finding nothing there before them to charge but onely the
ayre, are forced to make a stay or stand, and to defend them
selues with great disaduantage of Weapon; and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to make frunt of both their flankes and backe, all at

themselues out of all forme: whereof, and by the
neernesse of the light horsmen bee they speares or zagaias,
that haue charged them, as aforesaid, it commeth to passe,
that they haue not any ground nor roome to put their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

other waies to annoy the light horsmen, that haue charged

wounde and kill them and their horses both in flanks and

horsemen of the second ranke, that are oblique in ranke to
their fellowes before them, may at the same instant, haue
more open and conueniencie of ground to succour their

then they should presentlie cast about and flie in their little

vppon them with new charges and volees both in

be such, so many, and so continuall in giuing their volees

to set it downe in the end of these my former instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:

mariners, and saylers that are to mannage the Shippes,<note place="margin">The first.</note> and
all other sorts of artificers that are to repaire the Shippes,

concerning those seruices; which because it is a distinct and

for a warre offensiue, or defensiue or for both; into the

            <p>Now because I haue in diuers partes of Christendome

thinke none meete to be elected and inrolled vnder the age
of. 18. yeares; which is the lowest age that hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
amongst all warlike nations of auntient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
times; nor none aboue the age of. 35. or. 40. at the
most: And of the age of. 18. I would haue none elected
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:11434:90"/>
vnlesse they were of so great growth, &amp; corporall dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as that they were able to perform the duties &amp; effects of
souldiors, which verie fewe at that age can. And such as
should be elected after the age of 18. I would haue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
soldiors vntill they come to the age of 45. incase their
health and corporall disposition of bodie, doo continue in
them vntil that age.</p>
            <p>And so likwise, I would that such as were elected through
their good disposition of bodies to bee souldiors at 35. or
40. yeares old, should with good account and credit in the
shiers where they dwell, be dismissed from being souldiors
at the age of 45. and no waies further to bee emploied in
matters militarie, vnlesse their wisedome and sufficiencie
were such, as they were to serue as officers of bandes. And
the causes wherefore I would not haue any to bee elected
to bee souldiors aboue the age of 40. or to continue souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
aboue the age of 5. yeares more, which is 45. are; that
to elect and leauie olde men that neuer serued before to bee
young souldiors, is contrarie to all discipline; and to serue
as priuate souldiors aboue the age of 45. (vnlesse they bee
excellent archers in perfection of strong and cleane shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
it is more then is conuenient, considering that for the
defence of a kingdome where there is choice of young men
enough, it were contrarie to all reason and discipline that
they should continue their seruices as priuate souldiors any
longer, then vntil that age of 45. but in the countries where
they dwell, at that age with great credit to be dismissed, that
they may the better intend and follow their owne priuate
affaires and other yoonger men of sufficiencie and abilitie
of bodie and mind to bee chosen in their places: And thus
far concerning conueniencie of yeares.<note place="margin">Concerning the good and conuenient corporall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die of such as are to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled for sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And now to the second sufficiencie that is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in such as are to be elected and inrolled to be souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors

concerning the same, that the choice and election should
be such, as euery souldior that should be chosen should bee
a man well formed and dispost of body and mind, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
meet and fit either by former exercise from his youth;
or at least by aptnesse of mind and force, to learne the vse of
such weapons as he should be chosen and inrolled vnto: as
for example: I would have no man chosen to be an Archer
that had not so practised the vse of his bow from his youth,
that he should bee able to shoot strong, or at the least of a
conuenient strength and long arrowes, and therewithall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by continuall exercise to draw his arrow with three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and not with two (according to the new fashion) to

loose a great deale of the strength of their draught. And
thus farre in this place concerning corporall disposition of
bodie.</p>
            <p>And now to the third sufficiencie of such as are to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
chosen &amp; inrolled,<note place="margin">Concerning the honestie of such as are to be elected, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all such as should be elected and inrolled should be of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
parentage, and that their education and course of life
had bene such, as there were no notable vice to be noted in
them, and chiefly of dronkennesse, theft, blaspheming, com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon
swearing or brawling. Al which vices are such, as they
cause al such as are possessed of them to be disordered, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous,
and disobedient; which are things most contrary to
all true discipline. Also I would if it might be, that all such
as should be elected and chosen to be soldiors, should be of
themselues of some abilitie and substance either in landes,
or goods, or both; or else that from their parentes they
should be in possibilitie after their deceases to enioye some
lands, or goods, or both: And I would that they should be
of those two conditions before mentioned; I meane of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:11434:91"/>
good parentage &amp; present hauiour, or in possibilitie by the
death of their parents as aforsaid, because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same should be
a kind of obligation to their captains, as also to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common
wealth, for their good and obedient behauior, in their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

haue all soldiors and officers of bands at their first election<note place="margin">All soldiors &amp; officers of bands are at their first electi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Crowne and Realme of England.</p>
            <p>Now the election and inrollment of the archers, as also
of all the rest of the soldiors of other weapons being taken
with such regard and respect as aforsaid; I would then haue
them to be armed verie fitly and conueniently according
to euerie different sorte of weapon: And because that no
man can be conueniently and fitly armed, vnlesse he be first
fitly apparelled for his armor, and also for the vse of his wea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon,<note place="margin">No man can be conueniently, armed vnlesse he be first fitly apparelled.</note> and that in the campe and armie at Tilburie 1588.
wheras there were the regiments of diuers shieres, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
bands both of dimilaunces and light hormen, I did see
and obserue, so great disorder and deformitie in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell,
to arme withall, as I saw but a very few of that Army
that had any conueniencie of apparel, and chieflie of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
to arme vpon; whereof it came to passe that the most
of them did weare their armors verie vncomelie, and vnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie;
which foresaid doublets if they bee not conuenientlie
made, and of purpose to arme vpon according to the vse of
all antiquitie, it is not possible that armed men horsemen,
nor footemen should finde themselues in their armors at
ease: nor that they should vse their weapons with such dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie
as they may doo if their garments be purposelie and
fitlie made to arme vppon; nor yet that there can bee any
comlinesse in wearing their armors vppon such deformed
doublets; I would first therefore, that there should be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
regard had to the fit and conuenient apparelling of all
sortes of souldiors; and therefore to begin with souldiors
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:11434:92"/>
doublets,<note place="margin">Concerning the conuenient apparelling of all sorts of
sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors.</note> I would that their doublets should bee made of
Fustian according to the vse of all antiquitie, or of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moise
skinnes, aswel in respect of lasting, as that a man may
arme better vppon any of both those thinges, then vppon
Canuas, or any thinge that is more smooth, and lesse
woollie.</p>
            <p>Then concerning the form and fashion of their doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
I would that they should be of a conuenient heigth in
the Collers, aswell to defend their necks from cold in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as from heate in Summer. Then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I woulde that they
should be narrow in the shoulders, &amp; so smal in the sleeues,
and with so little bumbast, that the vambrases of armed
men might easilie close togither; and that archers vsing no
vambrases but certen stripes of serecloth or maile within
their sleeues to defend the cut of a sworde, might through
the smalnesse of their sleeues easilie draw and shoot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the string hitting vpon any part of the sleeue, but onelie
vpon their bracers.</p>
            <p>Then I would that their doublets should be made ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and wide vpon the stomacks and breastes, that the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors
being not pent by the straightnesse of their doublets
vpon their breastes, might the easlier fetch their breath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in fighting, or in any hastie march: and therewithall,
that their doublets be cutte flat vpon the bellie, and wasted
of like length to the Cuirasses of their armors, to the intent
that armed mens armors might sit the more iust and flat to
their bodies: But because the collars of armors doo beare
the chiefe waight of all the rest of the armour, I would wish
that the souldiors armed men horsmen, or footmen, should
either haue vnder Collars of Fustian conuenientlie bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basted
to defende the heueth and poise of their armours
from the paining, or hurting of their shoulders and necks;
or else that their doublets should be verie well bombasted
in all that part vnder their Collars both before and behind
according to the depth of the same, which will bee a great
ease to all armed men horsmen or footmen, for their often
and long continuing armed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:11434:92"/>Also I would that no armed men should weare any cut
doublets, as well in respect that the wearing of armour doth
quicklie fret them out, and also by reason that the corners
and edges of the lammes and iointes of the armours doo
take such holde vppon such cuttes, as they doo hinder the
quicke and sudden arming of men; as also that they are of
more impediment to harquebuziers, mosquetiers, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
for diuers respects to all skilfull soldiors wel knowne,
then doublets vncut are. Then I would wishe that there
should bee regard had to their hosen, that they might bee
easie for them to march and fight in; which the new fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
straight hosen are not: and therefore I would that they
should rather weare Greygescoes too vnder the knee, that
shoulde bee large, wide, and easie, lined with a Cotton li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
without any bombast; and next to the thigh with a
strong Canuas lining or false sloppe, wherevnto the nether
stockinges should be set and sowed, and gartered vnder the
knee, then either these new fashioned little round hose, or
newe fashion'd bombasted Greygescoes that are very
straight to the thighs and vpper parts; which in summer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the vneasinesse of them, doo with so much bombast
keep armed men exceeding hot, whereas the other beeing
large and wide as aforesaid, something after the fashion that
the Spanish souldiors doo vse, are a great deale more easie,
and chieflie for all sorts of footmen.<note place="margin">How archer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now as for their armors I would wish, that archers should
either weare Ilet holed doublets, that wil resist the thrust of
a sword, or dagger, and couered with some trim and gallant
kinde of coloured cloth to the liking of the Captains, with
their sleeues striped within, with certen narrow stripes of
serecloth or maile, to resist the cut of a sword, or else Iackes
of maile quilted vpon fustian to resist a blow or a thrust, of a
conuenient length, and the skirts not too long, in respect of
the lightnes &amp; easines of them: with their doublet sleeues as
aforesaid; and for the defence of their heads, because these
steele. Cappes commonly vsed, are of verie small comlines
for soldiors, and most of them too shallow, and therefore of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:11434:93"/>
small defence, I would wish some new and gallant fashion
morrions verie light and easie to be made for archers to
weare without any couering vpon them, but that they
should be milde or burnished white; which besides their
greater defence, being well and aptly made; would with
their brightnesse greatly bewtifie the archers that do weare
them. And as for the archers bowes, I would that they
should not be short after the new vse which causeth them
often to breake, but that they should be long and well backt
and nockt, according to the auncient vse; and their strings
whipt with fine thred, or silke; and that they should head
and make their first sheafes of arrowes, according to the
length that they do commonly vse to drawe. The blades of
their swordes I would haue to be verie good, and of the
length of a yard and not aboue; with their hilts only made
with. 2. portes, a greater and a smaller on the out side of
the hiltes, after the fashion of the Italian and Spanishe
arming swordes; and those swordes I would haue them to
weare with strong girdles of leather, their hangers of such
conuenient length, and so well formed as their swordes
might hang vpon the vpper parts of their thighes; not only
readie and verie easie to be drawen; but also by their well
hanging of them straight forward and backward, (I meane
not athwarte their bommes, as drommers, to giue place
&amp; roume to their drommes do vse; nor yet so farre forward
as they may lie athwarte their Codpeeces, as great boies
do vse at their first wearing of swordes when they come
new from schoole) that the said soldiors swords vpon their
hastie march, or any other occasion by their straight and
well standing of them, should hang firme without daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
or bobbing forward and backward, as swords vnsoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orly
worne, do commonly vse. The blades of their daggers
also, I would wish them to be not aboue 10 inches long, and
that the hilts of the same should be only made of one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
and short crosse without any portes, or hilts at all, and
not with great hilts after the fencers or alehouse fashion;
and that they should weare their daggers not vpon their
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:11434:93"/>
girdles at their backs, but hanging downe vpon their right
thighes before them, after the old English fashion; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that their daggers should stand the more firme and
steadie without bobbing or dauncing vp and downe vpon
the hastie march of the soldiors; I would that they should
weare them in leathers, after the fashion that I sawe some
of the soldiors of Sir Iohn Peters band deuise and vse, at
such time as I mustered his band neare vnto Brentwood the
yeare 1588. Which leathers being of the length of 7. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and 3. inches broad beneath, but aboue not so broad,
and haue in the vpper parts two cuts straight downeward,
for the waste of the girdle to goe through, and in the lower
end, two cuts straight athwart, for the dagger sheath to be
thrust through and downe euen to the verie locket; &amp; then
the locket of the dagger being fastned a little aboue, to two
holes through the leather right against the same with a
string or a lace; such daggers so worne, doo stand wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
firme, and verie readie for souldiors, archers, or armed
men to draw, and with thrustes to vse the pointes of them.
The archers also I would haue them to vse shooting gloues
with the inner partes of the fingers of Bucks leather, and in
no wise any leathers called finger stalles after the new fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Al their bracers also I would haue after the old fashion
of our English archers to many well known, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the new deuises. And thus farre concerning the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
apparelling, arming, and weaponing of archers.
And now to the election, apparelling, arming and weapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of harquebuziers.</p>
            <p>Harquebuziers I would wish them to be elected and
chosen of the yoongest sort of men,<note place="margin">Concerning the election apparelling, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers.</note> and of the meanest sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and size of all other sortes that should be allowed of, to
be elected and inrolled, and chieflie of such as haue small
skill and dexteritie in the long bowe, and archerie: For I
would that such as were skilfull in the long bow; I meane
good archers of what size of men soeuer; that they should
not be inrolled to any other weapon, considering that the
number of good archers of our Nation in these daies are so
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:11434:94"/>
few, and that, that kind of weapon is of so wonderfull and
miraculous effect in seruices of the field as by all auncient
and moderne experience amongst all Nations it hath bene
and is most manifest. Harquebuziers therefore I would
haue them to be of the yongest sort of men, as aforesaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they should be the more nimble to trauesse their
grounds, and to stoope to their peeces, and to take all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntages
of groundes, and of the smallest sorte and size of
men, because they should be the lesser markes in the sights
of their enemies in skirmish neare at hand, as is in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
instructions at large conteined.</p>
            <p>Their apparell I would haue to be dublets of fustian
without any cuttes, and Greigescoes all of the like sort and
fashion, as I haue before particulerlie set downe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
archers; and that they should haue euerie one of them
a saltenberg, commonly called a Mandilion of very good
broad cloath that will not shrinke, to encouer and keepe
drie their flasks and touchboxes and the pans and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes
of their harquebuzes in the time of wet &amp; moist wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and the same handsomely made to their bodies, and
of such Colours as euerie one of their Captaines should
make choice of.</p>
            <p>And therewithal that euerie one of them should haue an
vpright or sharpe morrion fast tied with a red skarfe vnder
their Chins after the spanish fashion, all white and grauen,
or at least, white vngrauen, and in no wise any black morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
because that the white doth beutefie the soldiors more,
and is of greater terror in the eie and sight of the Enemie.
The Cannons of their harquebuzes I would haue them to
be all of the length of a yard and not any longer nor shorter
all ranforced backward, and conuenientlie thinne forward;
and that the sights of their harquebuzes should be all open
sights; I meane without any pipes or couers vpon them,
because they might the more readilie take their sightes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from point at blanke if time will serue, or else from the
endes of their peeces. I would also that all those sights as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the pins of their peeces should be very euen and straight
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:11434:94"/>
set and filed to a iust and conuenient height; and their pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
chosen without any cracks or flawes within, verie well
boared and drawbored, and therewithal their vices at the
hinder ends of their peeces of such conuenient length, &amp;
so well made and filed, that their harquebuzes should not
recoile: besides all which I would that all their bullettes
should be of one Caliuer and heigth, and that of a meane
size for diuers causes, &amp; reasons that I haue before in mine
instructions alledged.</p>
            <p>All the stocks of their harquebuzes I would haue them
to be crooked (as we call them) and of good forme, and
not straight stocks, because that being crooked and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
stocks they doo more readily counterpoise the fore
end of their peeces, and more readilie fall into leuell when
they are in skirmish, and haue no leisure to take any sight
from point at blanke, but from the fore ends of their pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
then straight stockes doe: Besides that considering
the lightnesse of their peeces they may aswell and as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie
without rests at any time take their sights from point
at blanke with crooked stockes of good forme as if they
were straight. The Cockes, or serpentines I would haue
to be of conuenient compasse and able to receiue any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
match, and that the feathers and springs that doo
belong vnto them should be of so hard and good temper,
that they shoulde cause the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ockes or serpentines to fall
and rise so strong and quicke, as by their strong falling
with the matches into the pannes, they may make the fire
to sparcle, thereby in an instant to make the powder to
take fire.</p>
            <p>Then I would that euery harquebuzier should haue a
good and a faire flaske and touchbox, with strings to them
of conuenient length, and that they should bee taught
by their Corporalles very souldiorlie to weare them, and
to keep their powder in their flaskes and touchboxes very
drie. And I would that the pipes or mouths of their flaskes
should be a iust charge for their harquebuzes according to
the vse of the Spaniardes and Wallouns, and that the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:11434:95"/>
feathers and springs that doo make the plate or couer of
the lower part of the mouthes of their flaskes to open and
couer againe, should be of so good temper as they might
open and couer quicke and close, that the souldiors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
might bee assured not to ouercharge their peeces to
their daunger.</p>
            <p>Then I would that euerie harquebuzier should haue in
a little purse, or in a little bagge in his pocket, a little steele
with a flint, and a little peece of a certen kind of tinder like
a spunge, such as the harquebuziers Spaniards doo vse, to
strike fire to light their matches, with scourers, skrues, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
irons, and mouldes, and all other things requisite for
the well charging and keeping of their harquebuzes clean
and neat. Swordes also the blads of the length of a yard,
with hiltes of the fashion before mentioned, with strong
leather girdles, able to beare their swordes, flaskes, and
touchboxes, I would wish euerie harquebuzier to haue; &amp;
that they should weare their swordes of such conuenient
heigth, as I haue before declared, that archers and armed
men ought to doo. But as for daggers, I would wish no
harquebuzier to weare any, because they haue so seldome
occasion to vse them: and therefore doo rather increase
heueth and burthen then serue for any other purpose; the
experience whereof hath taught the harquebuziers of all
Nations to weare no daggers; Besides all which, I would
haue the harquebuziers to be taught, as also the mosque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
to know the differences of powder and of match, that
they may bee the better able to know what charges they
shall giue to their peeces, according to the goodnesse or
badnesse of the powder, and therewithall alwaies in skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
or otherwise to charge their peeces with some softe
paper, or something else betwixt their powder and their
bullets, and after their bullets to restraine the same: and to
haue their flaskes full of good and drie powder well cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and their touchboxes full of fine and drie touchpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with al other thinges requisit to the well vsing of their
peeces, and thus farre concerning harquebuziers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:11434:95"/>Mosquetiers I would wish to be elected of such men as
are of good force &amp; strength of bodie,<note place="margin">How mosquetiers should be elected appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, armed, and weaponed.</note> although they were
but of meane statures, for the tallest and best formed men I
would haue reserued for armed men piquers, and battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes
or halbarders to be reduced into squadrons or battles;
and yet I would not as aforesaid, that any good or strong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
should be enrolled to any other kind of weapon, but
onely to the longbowe, for the causes before mentioned.
But it is conuenient that mosquetiers should bee of good
force, and strength, in respect of the heauines of their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
and furniture, that by their strength and agilitie, they
may the better cary, handle, and mannage their mosquets:
And I would wish that they should be euerie waies appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled,
and that they should weare their swordes in strong
girdles without any daggers as the harquebuziers aforsaid,
and that they should be armed with the like morrions to
the harquebuziers before mentioned. Then I would wish

of one heigth, or caliuer of bullet with open sights, and in
all other thinges and particularities of the like perfection to
the harquebuzes that I haue before mentioned.</p>
            <p>But all the mosquets I would haue them to bee with
straight stocks because that considering their rests with the
great heueth of their peeces they may the better sett the
straight stocks to their shoulders and take their sights more
readily &amp; certainly from point at blank, then if their stocks
were crooked. Their iron forkes, or rests I would haue
them to be well and euen formed, that when the staues are
fixed in the ground, their mosquets might ly iust and euen
in their rests, which they cannot do if they be made higher
on the one side then of the other, as many are. The staues
of their rests, I would wishe to be of iust and conuenient
length and strength with piques of a good length that they
may enter a good waie in and stand the more firme in the
ground. Their flaskes, touchboxes, and stringes I would
haue to be of as great perfection as the flaske and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boxes
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:11434:96"/>
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harquebuziers before mentioned. And I would
wish that they should charge their mosquets with powder
out of the pipes or charges of the flaskes as the harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers
aforsaid, and not out of charges that hang vpon band
rolles as many doo vse: Because that oftetimes the couers
of such charges doo flie off, and shed the powder, in such
sort as the mosquetiers if they be not olde souldiors or wel
practised, doo sometimes thinke that they charge their
peeces out of such bandrol charges, when the powder was
spilt before, so as sometimes they put in their bullets into
their peeces without any powder.</p>
            <p>And I would that euerie societie or fellowship of 10.
mosquetiers should haue one great mould to cast 2. sortes
of bullets, the one full bullets, and the other 2. or 3. bores
smaller to charge vpon some occasion with the more ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leritie.
Also that the same mould should bee so long and
bigge, as it should be able to cast at one time 8. haileshot
of warre besides the bullettes, which haileshot of Warre
should be of the heigth and Caliuer of small pistoll bullets.
And this great moulde with a melting pan and lead, and
all other thinges belonging to the same, should be for the
common vse of the whole societie of 10. mosquetiers: as
the like pan and mould and other thinges which I for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities
sake did omit should be for the common vse of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
societie of 10. harquebuziers. And yet it doth behooue
the societies aswell of mosquetiers as of harquebuziers to
haue some priuate mouldes for bullets, besides their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and publike mould. And thus far concerning mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers.
And now to armed men piquers.</p>
            <p>The arming doublets and greygesc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es for armed men
piquers,<note place="margin">How piquers should be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled armed &amp; weaponed.</note> I haue before described, and therefore I proceed
to the arming and weaponing of them, as followeth. I
would haue all the piquers armed with burgonets of good
depth wel lined and stuffed for the easinesse of their heads,
and tied with a red skarfe vnder their chinnes, and that
they should not wear them flapping open vntied, as I haue
seene many of our Mosquetiers and armed men heere at
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:11434:96"/>
home doo. Also I would haue them armed with collers of
a good size, with backes and with cuyrats not too flat but
somthing high vpon the stomachs, that they may easily in
any hastie march fetch their breaths: &amp; the belly or lower
part of the Cuirasses, I would haue to bee lowe, and rather
somthing flat then any thing ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing or high, because they
may hauing their vambraces on, the more easily put their
hands to their swords without any impediment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
heigth of the lower parts, or bellies of their Cuiras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Also I would haue them to haue tasses to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mid thigh
not too broad, but of conuenient length and breadth,
comely and fit for their greygescoes.</p>
            <p>Also I would haue them to haue pouldrons of a good
compasse and size, and vambraces both ioined together,
and not asunder, because that the poise of the pouldrons
and vambraces, hanging vpon the pinnes and springes of
their collars, they doo not weigh so much, nor are not so
wearisom as when they are separated; and that they weare
their vambrases tied with pointes to their doublets vnder
their pouldrons; Also I would that al armed men should
weare gauntlets, as the armed men piquers Italians, and
Spaniards doo, and not to be bare and disarmed handed
as our English and some other Nations of late years haue
vsed, because that any smal wound receiued vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands
doth presently make such souldiors impotent, and vnable
to vse their weapons that haue receiued such woundes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be but small. Their swords, their daggers, and
their girdles I haue before particularlie set down, how and
in what sort I would haue them to weare them. Their
piques also I would wish them all to bee of the length of
18. foote, and neither longer nor shorter for the causes
in my former instructions and discourses mentioned, as
also conteined in my Booke of certen Discourses printed
1590. and that they shoulde haue verie good and foure
square heads of good temper, and lowe armed with long
cheeks, and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midst couered or armed with black lether
or black vellure, or with some other such thing, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:11434:97"/>
should not be too great nor heauie in wood, that thereby
the souldiors may carrie them and mannage them with
ease.</p>
            <p>Also I would that the staues of the piques should bee of
a tite and stiffe ashe, and not of ashe that dooth sagge, and
bend when the piquers doo carrie their piques breast high
before hand couched, because that such sagging and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ashe, although it be verie tough yet it is more heauie
then the other ashe: besides that the piquers cannot carry

               </gap> of such sagging, and bending piques so euen

other piques that doo not bend nor sagge, but are tite and
straight. And thus farre concerning armed men piquers,

apparelled and armed in Corslets in all points and peeces
of armour like vnto the piquers before mentioned: and yet
if those halbarders or battleaxes in stead of pouldrons and
vambraces did weare sleeues of good reueted maile that
might couer all their shoulders and armes euen from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Collers, breasts and backes, to the verie Gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
considering that by the good defence and easinesse of
such sleeues of maile, they might mannage their halbards
the better, I would for my part allowe them for verie well
armed, although I woulde that the piquers because they
are the formost rankes should bee in any wise armed with
pouldrons, vambraces and gauntlets, as aforesaid, and not
with any sleeues of maile. Also I would that the halbarders
should weare their swords and daggers of the same length,
and in the verie same sort that I haue appointed the armed
men piquers. But their halbardes or battleaxes I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would
haue to be strong and of good waight with long straight
edges, with good piques backward, and strong pointes of
conuenient length, but in no wise too long forward, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:11434:97"/>
that they should for the strengthning of them, be armed
with two cheekes downe the staffe of a soote and more

should not be aboue 6. foot long from the top of the
points to the lowest end of the little iron hoopes common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called the Feralles of their staues.</p>
            <p>Also I would haue certen other halbardes that
should be incorporated in euerie band of archers and

Halbarders I would haue them called extraordinarie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not for the squadron; And those I would
haue to be armed only with burgonets with collers, verie
light Cuirasses and backes, and without any tasses, and in

of their dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blets I meane within the fustian striped with
certen narrow stripes of serecloth, or of maile, to defend
the Cutt of a sword, and if that some of those extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
battleaxes, or halbarders, were armed but only with
burgonets and with short skirted Ierkins of buffe, with a

staues of the halbards of such halbarders extraordinarie, I
would wish to be longer by a foote, or a foote and a halfe
or more, then the armed and ordinarie halbardes that are
to enter into squadron, that is of 7. foote and a halfe long,
or more, because that they being to succor troupes and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
of loose shot, or to do execution vppon diuers acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
as aforesaid, and often times to fight with the enemy
hand to hand, and sometimes to encounter with two, or

Besides that it is more then strange that such Captains do
not censider that soldiors with their legges and thighes do

thus far concerning the apparelling, arming &amp; weaponing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:11434:99"/>
of halbarders, or battleaxes: So as I haue now finished the
apparelling arming, and weaponing of all sortes of foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
by our Nation in these daies vsed, and therfore I will
God willing proceed to the apparelling, arming, weapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and horsing of all such different sorts of horsmen, as
we now a daies doo vse, with some other such sortes of
horsemen also, as I would wish should be in vse and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
for the defence of the Crowne and Realme, as also for
any forren inuasion.</p>
            <p>And therfore to begin with light horsmen, such as in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
shires of england we doo now vse,<note place="margin">How light hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should be apparelled, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, horsed &amp; weaponed.</note> armed with red or
pied cappes and steele sculles within them, and with Iackes
and speares by some called Gads; in stead of this rude kinde
of arming as I account it, `I would wish that they should bee
armed with burgonets, or else with vpright morrions after
the Spanish manner, with collers, cuirasses, and backs, and
short tasses, and with sleeues of maile and gauntlets, or else
gloues of maile in stead of gauntlets; And to the intent they
should bee the more easely &amp; fitly armed, I would wish that
they should be apparelled I mean in doublets &amp; Greigescoes,
in the very same sort as is before for armed men declared;
And as for their speares I would wish them to be of 18. foot
long, and those I would wish to bee so long, because they
might not only vse them to charge vpon their thighes, but
also that they might by taking and houlding them in the
midst, vse them in stead of punching staues: And as for their
geldings, I would haue them to be of good life and size, and
swift of ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rire, and that they should ride them with light
short cheeked bittes, according to their horses mouthes, &amp;
that their sadles should not bee so little and ill fashioned, as
those which we commonly call scottish sadles, but rather
that they should bee of that fashion, which wee call nowe a
daies <hi>Morocco</hi> sadles, with pommells of suche conuenient
heigth as one single pistoll in a case might bee buckled and
set fast to the same, as also that the same should be made fast
and buckled athwarte the lower end vpon a little boulster to
make it to sit the more firme, and fitly vpon all occasions to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:11434:99"/>
be vsed according to the manner of the Reistres: Also I
would that no saddle should be without 3. girthes, and ther
withal should haue Patrells, and croupers with the raines
and headstalles light and of very good fashion. Besides al
this, I would haue those kind of light horsmen to bee verie
wel practised in the wel riding and vsing of their horses, and
handling of their weapons in euery kind and sort. And thus
far concerning that kind of light horsmen. And now to the
apparelling, arming, &amp; weaponing of stradiots by me men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned
in my former instructions, and discourses.</p>
            <p>Stradiots are a kind of light horsmen that haue been v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

haue beene armed and weaponed in diuers different sorts

it according to my opinion and best liking, I would wish
those kind of souldiors to be verie well elected and chosen
of such men as haue dispositions of bodies and mindes to
learne very well to ride, as also to diet, vse, and keepe their
horses, &amp; therwithall to learne to handle al their weapons
with great dexteritie: And as for their apparel, I meane
their arming doublets &amp; hosen, I would haue them to be
after the verie same sort as I haue appointed vnto other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
men. And I would wish them all to bee armed with
good burgonets and buffes, with Collers, with Cuirasses,

               </gap>ets couered with maile, thereby the better
to vse their pistols and other weapons; with such good
swordes, daggers, and girdles, as I haue before appointed
to other armed men, and in stead of Launces or speares, I
woulde wish them to haue Launces commonlie called
<hi>Laun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with double heads of good and hard temper according to

that taking them in the midst, they may strike both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:11434:100"/>
and backewarde, I meane aswell their enemies that
they haue in frunt or in flanks, as also their enimies &amp; their
horses that may vppon any retrait pursue them: I woulde
wish them also to haue horses or geldings, strong, of good
size and Carrire, with saddles of the fashion of the Reistres
of Saxony, with Croupers, pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>els, good headstalles and
raines with small chaines, to the intent that if their raines
should happen to be cut, they should not be straight at the
mercie of their horses, or of their enemies. And I would
wish them to haue at their saddle po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mels very good sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
pistolles, in good cases well and firmelie sette at their
saddles as I haue before mentioned, with touch boxes full
of fine powder in some conuenient places about them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and with a Cartage boxe of Iron of 7. or 8. cartages
fast set vpon euerie pistoll case, and the Cannons of the
pistolles ranforced backeward, and of small bullet; and of
the length of 12. inches, with good firelocks and no snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunces,
because in true vnderstanding for diuers causes
that I could alledge, firelocks are a great deale more certen
and of lesse failing then snaphaunces are. Also I woulde
that they should haue at their saddle pommels of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
side to the pistolles, men at armes axes; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that they are good to fight withall, are verie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
for horsemen to vse for manie requisit purposes,
and vses, which because they are thinges so well knowne
to all men of Warre of experience, I omit. And these
kind of light horsemen Stradiots thus horsed, armed, and
weaponed, are meet for all sorts of skirmishes and incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and also are of great execution against harquebuzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and mosquetiers, and to bee briefe against al sortes of
horsemen and footmen.</p>
            <p>But because their so many weapons, as are before
mentioned for one horseman to vse may seeme strange to
such of this time as do not loue to trouble themselues but
with very few weapons, I say it is no strange matter, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that such as doo meane to fight wel, do like to haue
store of weapons, that incase one or two should faile, they
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:11434:100"/>
may presentlie betake themselues to the choise and vse of
others, according to the time and occasion: But such as
would thinke those weapons by me before mentioned to
be too many for one man to vse, woulde thinke it a great
deale more strange, to see a Turky horsman that trauelling
by the way doth besides his Cemeterie, and his crooked
dagger, voluntarily carrie his Launce, his harquebuze, and
his Turkie bowe, with his sheafe of arrowes, with another
weapon which now I haue forgot, and all those weapons
they doo weare and carie so conuenientlie, and aptlie, as
they may vse euery one of them in his most conuenient
time and place. And thus far concerning Stradiots. And
now concerning dimilaunces.</p>
            <p>Dimilaunces are horsemen next in degree and account
vnto men at armes, as well in greatnesse,<note place="margin">Concerning the apparelling arming, ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sing and weaponing of dimilaunces</note> and puissance of
horses, as in strong and sure arming; and they ought to be
apparelled, as I haue in diuers partes before mentioned.
They ought to be armed also, with their helmettes, with
their beauers, with their sights not too high nor too lowe,
with collers, cuirasses, with rests verie conueniently set not
too high nor too low, backs, tasses, &amp; short cuisses too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the knee, or else with long Cuisses from vnder the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
lam of their Cuyrasses to vnder the knee, without tas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Also they ought to haue good and well compassed
pouldrons, vambrases, and gauntlets, and gussets of maile
well set for the defence of their armeholes, and their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
ought to be arming swords, and daggers, worne in
good and strong girdles, long, and strong launces, with a
curtilace of the one side of the saddle pommell, or a steele
mace, or a man at armes axe on the other side as aforsaid.
Howbeit I haue seene some both men at armes, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launces
vse tocks very conueniently worne after the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian
&amp; Turkie manner vnder their thighs; which Tocks
are long narrow stiffe swords onlie for the thrust: And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
I haue seene that in stead of Curtilaces &amp; tocks haue
worn single pistols, which pistols bicause men at armes or
dimilances are to giue their charge in squadron with the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:11434:101"/>
pointes of their Launces and shocke of their horses, they
cannot haue so much leisure to pull out, and to pul down<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
their cocks, as stradiots and other light horsemen that do
fight loose in skirmish or in other little troupes may: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that the gauntlets of men at Armes and dimilaunces
are not fitlie made to handle pistols in, as all men may see
that list to prooue them: and those dimilaunces ought to
be all horsed vppon puissant horses for the shocke and not
vpon geldings vnlesse they be very puissant; And their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
for their horses ought to bee steele saddles of good
forme, and of a conuenient bignesse, and as light as they
conuenientlie may bee made with good headstalles and
raines with chaines as aforesaid; with good patrells and
croupers. Also if there were any gentlemen in those
bands of dimilaunces, I would wish them not to bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the forepart of steele barbes, to the intent that vppon
any day that were likelie to be of great seruice against the
enemie, they should arme and barbe the forepart of their
horses, because that they being placed in the first rank, or
two rankes, should bee the better able to giue and receiue
the charge and shocke with the lesse daunger to their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
And thus far for dimilaunces.</p>
            <p>Now as for men at Armes because all men that are of
any experience and vnderstanding in matters militarie,<note place="margin">Men at armes out of vse in Christendome.</note>
doo well know that they must bee all armed, <hi>cap a pie,</hi> and
their horses verie puissant, and all barbed aswell behind as
before, with the number of weapons that they ought of
ordinary to weare and vse: And because that in these daies
partlie in respect of their great pay; but chiefly because the
art and science militarie hath beene of late years, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is in great declination and decaie, they are not in
vse in England, nor in any part of Christendome as they
haue beene, I ouerpasse them.</p>
            <p>But now it is likely enough that some Gentlemen that
haue beene trained vp in these late Ciuill wars of the Low
Countries or France may thinke that I haue forgotten my
selfe in not making mention in these aforesaid musters, of

and as vnskilfull in souldiorlie wearing, and vsing of

with such weapons as I haue before particulerlie named
that do belong to a dimilaunce; and if he be a stradiot, then
the Mustermaister is to view him a foote as aforesaid, to
see whether his apparell and armor be fitte for his person,
and therewithall aptly and soldiorlie worne, as also whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he haue all his weapons belonging vnto horsemen of
his sorte, and whether they bee good, and that he doth
weare them aptly and soldiorly, yea he ought to view how
he doth weare his hosen and Greigescoes, bootehosen,
bootes and spurres, and whether he doth weare them apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fitly like a horseman or like a Clowne: And incase
there be any imperfections or imperfection in any of those
particularities, he is presentlie to giue order vpon some

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:11434:103"/>
to be imposed vpon the partie that doth set forth the

lame; and therefore it behoueth the Mustermaister to
haue a skilfull Ferrar with him at his taking of Musters, that
can with skill Iudge of their lamenesse or soundnesse. All
which performed, then the Mustermaister must command
the horsman to mount on horseback,<note place="margin">Muster mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are to see that the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can well vse their horses and weapons.</note> and to put his horse

and to set it againe vpon his thigh and to stoppe and turne
his horse both of the right and lefte hand; and if he be a

he is to commaund him to gallop the field as if he were in

weapon of his with dexteritie; which being soldiorlike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
he is to be allowed to passe the muster for a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
soldior: but in case his horse be restie or headstrong,
such a horse how sound soeuer, is not to be allowed, vnlesse
he may in short time be reformed. And so likewise if he
be an archer, or Crosbower on horsebacke, he must verie
particulerlie view, and see; whether his apparell, armor and

verie curiouslie to view euerie one of their horses that they
be of conuenient age, and size, and sound of wind and lim,
as also whether their saddles, bridles, bittes, pattrels, and
croupers, and other furniture be in perfection.</p>
            <p>All which beeing by the mustermaister throughoutlie
viewed and found in order and perfection, then hee is to

that the armours and Weapons of all Shieres
should be kept by such rich men as doo finde those armors
and weapons, in their owne houses; and such as are found
by the common purse of parishes, that they should be kept
in the chiefe mens houses of those parishes where the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors
dwell; that vppon occasion of those seruices should
weare and vse them, aswell in respect that all men by all
reason will be more carefull to keepe and maintain in good
order such apparell, armor and weapons as were bought
at their owne charges, then great Townes, or Gentlemen,
or Corporalles, that neuer bought the same: Besides that
vpon any sudden alarum, or giuing of fire to the beacons
vpon the enemies comming to inuade, or other occasion
of seruice, when the souldiors of the whole shire, shoulde

and with a great deale more celeritie, apparell, arme and
weapon themselues in warrelike manner, the same beeing
in their owne houses, if they be owners of the same, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

in such houses of the same Towne whereas the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture

to Gentlemens or Corporalles houses, or to great townes
3. or 4. miles off; where their armors &amp; furniture are kept,
&amp; there in hubbledeshuffe disorderlie to arme themselues;
wherof, besides diuers other disorders that do ensue often
times vpon such sudden Alarmes, and armings, little men
doo put on great or tall mens armors, and leaue little ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
vnfit for great men to put on; according to the olde
saying, first come first serued; And so likewise they do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the right choosing of their apparell and Weapons;
whereof inseweth great disorder and confusion. And these

vpon the holidaies, during certen moneths in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> summer,

themselues with such weapons as they are inrolled vnto, as
archers to shooting game at Rouers, &amp; long buts, with their
long bowes, according to the ancient vse of England, and
that the harquebuziers in the presence of the chiefe men

3. or 4. other shot: And this at the charge either
of the parishes, or of such rich men as doo find such soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors,
or otherwise as it may be better considered of, and
deuised. Also I would that such soldiors as are piquers
being disarmed should with blunt piques, learne to march
soldiorly, as also with dexeritie to handle and manage
them, thereby the better to know how in seruice to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
their sharpe piques; as also the halbarders with blunt
halbardes made for the purpose, should learne to giue
both blow and thrusts at their enemies with their greatest
aduauntage: Howbeit as for halbarders and piquers there
is no neede that they should be so often exercised to the
vse of their weapons as the soldiors with weapons of
volee; because that soldiors with weapons of volee, be they
horsemen or footmen shal neuer be able effectually to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the vse and effects of their weapons in seruices of
the field in earnest, if they be not often and long before
exercised in sporte with dexteritie to mannage and vse
those weapons. And so likewise vpon such aforesaid ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydaies,
I would wish that all sorts of horsemen of what

other principall men where they dwel, appointed for that
purpose, ride their horses, and exercise themselues on hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
