            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

although for the great hast the Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
could not be so wel repaired as was

and hauing sayled many daies in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite

Gouernour of the Cittie, and
Captaine generall; for wee had great
neede of water, and to repaire our

I had intelligence by an <hi>Indian,</hi>
that <hi>Frances Drake</hi> dyed in <hi>Nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre

was afterwardes more manifestlye
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10090:9"/>
knowne: And hauing giuen you a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of all that happened hitherto:
Now I let you vnderstand, that I left
this Port the second of March, and
toke our course towards the <hi>Hauana,</hi>
where I thought to haue founde the
English fleete, &amp; also vsed all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
possible: vpon Munday the
eleauenth of the said Month, about
two of the clocke in the afternoone, at
the issue of the Isle of <hi>Pinas,</hi> in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of <hi>Guaniguanico,</hi> I met with
the English fleete, being fourteene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
good Shippes, I drew towards them
although they had the winde of vs, &amp;
our Admirall who bore vp towardes
the winde, with other two Shippes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to draw neere them, and although
we set thus vppon them, three times
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10090:10"/>
with all their Shippes, yet would they
not set againe vppon vs, and those of
our men which were farthest off cryed
to them amaine, being both within
shot of Artillerie, Muskats and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers,
whereby they receiued euident
hurt by vs: They shot off now &amp; then
at vs, and especially their Admirall,
and seeing our resolution how sharpe
we were bent towards them, they with
all expedition and speede possible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to flie awaie, hoysing Sayles and
leauing their Oares for hast in the
Sea: but I followed them, with nine
Shippes all the night following, and
with fower more the next daye, till I
made them double <hi>Saint Antonies</hi>
point, and so I tooke the course towards
<hi>La Canet de Bahamet,</hi> according
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10090:10"/>
to the instructions from his Maiestie:
It little auailed vs to bee seene, with
lesse number of Shippes, neither yet all
the diligence we could vse, could cause
them to staye or come neere vs, nor to
shoote off one Hargabush or peece of
Artillerie, for they fled away as fast as
they could, and their Shippes were wel
diminished, and that the best parte of
them, the rest they repaired in the port
<hi>Bella,</hi> whereas they were about fourtie
daies before, and so by that meanes
they were all well repaired, and our
Shippes verie foule, because the time
would not permit vs to trimme them: I
have sailed two Monethes and a halfe
in the Shippe called the <hi>Capitana,</hi> si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
we departed from <hi>Carthage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
we haue not repaired their Pumps
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10090:11"/>
nor clensed them: And the same daie <hi>I</hi>
departed thence, my Shippes were all
foule with Barnacles, our Admirall
and the rest of our Shippes haue the
like impediment, but no great hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
vnto vs for ought J could perceiue
by our enemies: It is manifest what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
they had of vs, and by no
meanes was it possible for vs to take
them, vnlesse wee could haue come to
deale with them with fire and sworde.
Neuerthelesse they left vs one good
ship behind for our share, wel manned,
which tolde me that the <hi>Drake</hi> dyed
in <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and that they
haue made for Generall of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
fleete, the <hi>Colonell Quebraran,</hi>
and also by meanes of the small time
being streightly followed by vs, they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10090:11"/>
had no opportunitie to take either wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
woode or flesh, and they are also
in such bad case, that J know not how
they will bee able to arriue in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the number of men we haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
are about 140. and 15. Noble
Captaines of their best sort, and some

a Generall, to tie the credite of his reporte
locally to any place vppon the report of a

whome they neuer saw, as to deliuer for

For admit the mistaking of the place

And as concerning the losse of any Barkes
or men in our Nauie, by the valour of the
Spaniard before <hi>Sir Fraunces Drake</hi> his
death, wee had none (one small Pinnesse
excepted) which we assuredly know was
taken by chaunce falling single into a fleete
of fiue Frigots (of which was Generall,<note place="margin">The successe of the kings fiue Frigots.</note>
                  <hi>Don Pedro Telio,</hi>) neere vnto the Island of

one of them we burnt in the harbour of

For true it is, <hi>Sir Fraunces Drake</hi> dyed of
the Flixe which hee had growne vppon
him eight daies before his death, and
yeelded vp his spirite like a Christian to

his creatour quietly in his Cabbin. And
when the Generall shall suruey his losses,
he shall finde it more then the losse of the

the Bullet: But the death of <hi>Sir Fraunces
Drake</hi> was of so great comfort vnto the

played her part and made good fight for

the <hi>Aduenture</hi> again within Muskat shot,
who hauing chaunged many a great Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,

and continued it an hower with small

with diuers others of their Ships,
were so beaten, that they left off the fight,
and were forced to lye in the winde, for
that they durst not lye of either board by
reason of their many and great Leakes,
which they had receiued by our greate

thinking to get the winde,<note place="margin">The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all carried his Creset light, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie was vppon his brode side.</note> which in the

gaue them the winde. All that night they
kept themselues vppon our broade side,
notwithstanding our Admirall carryed
his Cresset light all night: hauing greate

care of our smallest Shippes: This fight
continued about fower howers til it was
neere night, in the which fight, thanks be
to God, there was slaine so fewe persons
of our English fleete as I thinke the like

so little losse of men: What harme befell

their Shippes were sore beaten and raked
thorough, whereby there was such fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
backe and lying by the Lee to stoppe
their leakes, as some of them were driuen
to haste awaye, and rather to runne on
shore to saue themselues then sincke in
the Sea: Besides within two howers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our fight with them, wee saw one of
their great Shippes on fire which burnt
into the Sea, and all the Sterne of another
of their Shippes blowen vp: And in the
morning a Shippe of our fleete was runne
so neere the land, that to double the Cape
current hee must of necessitie tacke about
&amp; fall in the wake of the enemie, which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10090:25"/>
caused our Generall in the <hi>Garland</hi> and the
<hi>Defiance</hi> to tacke about, which two ships
forced the three Shippes of the enemies
which were put forth to take our Shipp,
or else to cause her runne on grounde) to
returne to their fleete to saue themselues,
hoysing all their sayles for haste: This
morning they were faire by vs hauing the

durst nor would come neere vs: What
became of the rest of their fleet we know
not, but true it was that they were in
great distresse mightily beaten and torne,
by hauing receiued many Bullets from vs.
All this day wee had sight of them, but
they shewed little will to fight or come
neere vs, so we keeping our course west,
and by North, about sixe of the clocke
at night lost the sight of them. And this
