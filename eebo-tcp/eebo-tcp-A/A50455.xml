            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>MEdicines</hi> being of the greateſt Importance, and the principal part of the <hi>Art</hi> of Phyſick: they require the greateſt Conſideration, ſerious Care, and ſtrict Examination, for an aſſurance of their validity and worth; for as much as the Reputation of the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and Life of the <hi>Patient,</hi> doth depend thereon: an errour or neglect herein, fruſtrates and baffles all the Phyſician's Learning; and if he be not skillful (not by Book reading, but Manual Operation) in this grand work, all his other learned qualifications are but deceit, and avail little in Curing. And ſince the Import of <hi>Medicines</hi> is ſo great, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the immediate Inſtruments contending with Diſeaſes; and from their Power and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, Curing is performed or fruſtrated; it mainly behooves the <hi>Phyſician</hi> (and as much it concerns the <hi>Patient)</hi> that he be compleatly provided with a ſtock of elaborate, excelling <hi>Medicines,</hi> reformed and well proved; ſuch as he may confide in; to oppoſe the ſecret inteſtine Enemies, that prey upon <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> and with which he may repair and ſupport the Fabrick of humane Bodies, unto the period of their term, by the common Courſe of <hi>Nature:</hi> elſe it may be ſaid, this or that Perſon came to an untimely end; as many do, for want of good means, or due adminiſtration. This premiſed, I proceed to the matter propoſed.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Medicines,</hi> that are deſigned and formed by <hi>Art,</hi> in reſpect of their Latitude, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and adaption; may be divided into three Ranks or Claſſes: and then they are either <hi>Catholic, Specific,</hi> or <hi>Appropriate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Catholic</hi> (or univerſal) is a Medicine of large extent and comprehenſion, applicable to, and uſeful in many and various <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and alſo in divers <hi>Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Specific</hi> Medicine is ſuch, as <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Art</hi> hath ſpecificated and deſigned for the Cure of one particular Diſeaſe only; and that in divers Perſons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Appropriate</hi> Medicine, is yet narrower and more reſtrained, being preſcribed for, and adapted to the particular Caſe of one ſingle Perſon only; under ſuch circumſtances and complicated Infirmities.</p>
            <p>Now to compare theſe three ſorts of Medicines, of different extenſions; as touching their worth, uſefulneſs and certainty in Curing; my <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> determines thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:33860:2"/>
The <hi>Catholic</hi> Medicine, that hath been ſtudiouſly formed, oft reviſed, reformed and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorated, by a skilful <hi>Artiſt</hi> in <hi>Pharmacy;</hi> long and often proved, and thereby approved, for its amicable, ſteddy, and certain operation; and moſt frequently attended with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: this excels all other; for its generous Latitude, and comprehenſive Virtues; being a ready, moſt confiding, and advantageous aſſiſtant againſt many <hi>Diſeaſes;</hi> very uſeful, and fitly applicable to divers <hi>Perſons,</hi> though differently ſeized and afflicted; but requiring ſuch manner of Operation as this <hi>Catholic</hi> performs: whether it be <hi>Cathartic, Diaphoretic, Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> &amp;c. thus allowing a plurality of Catholiks, diſtinct in their operations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Specific</hi> Medicine (that is truly ſo) having been frequently experimented, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom failing to do its Work; is a rare good <hi>Medicine</hi> for a ſingle <hi>Diſeaſe;</hi> but then it is bounded within that narrow compaſs of one <hi>particular</hi> Malady; and its virtues are not of that generous, uſeful, and extenſive Nature, like the <hi>Catholic</hi> Medicine; and is therefore inferiour in excellency and worth, excepting only againſt that <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> for which it is <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficated,</hi> or peculiarly adapted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Appropriate</hi> preſcribed Medicine, adapted to <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Caſe</hi> (in the new Mode of Practice) though ſeemingly ſounded upon much Learning, by traditional Book aſſiſtance; yet is much more caſual, hazardous, uncertain in operation and ſucceſs, much leſs to be preſumed and relyed on, than the two former Medicines: for this is but a <hi>Preſcript</hi> deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by conjecture and probability, and an Experiment to be made at a venture, or at beſt by <hi>analogy,</hi> which is no certain Rule: and therefore this appropriated chance-Medicine, muſt come far behind the two former, in dignity and ſafety, becauſe they are Medicines proved and approved; this never was proved, but waits for Sentence until the tryal be paſt; and whether this appropriated <hi>Recipe</hi> will prove <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> cannot tell, but he hopes well: and this he will ſay for himſelf, the Ingredients are all good and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: but that is not ſufficient; for granted that all theſe things be innocent and good in themſelves, as you ſay, it does not therefore neceſſarily follow, that they muſt needs make a good Medicine, for ſuch a purpoſe, and to operate ſo and ſo; but it may happen much otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſon why this <hi>Appropriated</hi> Medicine, though contrived and appointed by learned Men, ſhould be thus uncertain and dubious to rely on, are theſe: Firſt, Becauſe every new <hi>aſſociation</hi> of ingredients, or variety of <hi>preparation</hi> and manner of compoſition (to form an <hi>Appropriate</hi> Medicine) ſo much alters the Ingredients, in their properties and virtues, by acting and re-acting upon each other, that their ſingle Natures and Virtues are not the ſame in <hi>this,</hi> as they were in <hi>another</hi> Conjunction: and every new mixture, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent preparation, makes ſuch a change in their harmony and agreement, that the reſult or product is not foreknown by the beſt gueſſing judgment; but <hi>tryal</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> muſt declare, whether it be good or bad: whether theſe things will yoak, and draw amicably toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whether they will all concur and conſpire with the intended operation: and if they will be ſubjugated, unite and comply with the form of the Medicine; and whether a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion in their quantities may not appear afterwards, and ſome ingredient may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly exalted, and prevail over the reſt, to a diſguſt at leaſt, if not a greater injury; in bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſing the Medicine from the operation intended. He that can make all theſe requiſites, ſo evenly to fall in with the Medicine, and hit it ſo rightly, upon the firſt projection (of an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated</hi> Medicine) is a wonderful lucky Man: and to do all this, in a quarter of an hour, at the Sick Man's Chamber, with <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Ink;</hi> and I cannot deſign and compleat a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine at home in a quarter of a year, with the uſe of a <hi>Laboratory,</hi> to be well ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; this is ſtrange, very ſtrange. But look into theſe appropriated <hi>Recipes,</hi> filed at the Shops, and the Myſtery of this does plainly appear; That they are not ſuch as the World does believe them to be; but a ſort of ſquinting, diſcordant, uncertain, unreformed Medicines, upon the view of an expert Operator in <hi>Pharmacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:33860:2"/>
Secondly, No certainty of knowledge in the Patient you deſign the <hi>appropriated</hi> Medicine for (ſurer than the <hi>Catholic</hi> and <hi>Specific</hi> adaption) in as much as no <hi>idioſyncratical,</hi> or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual propriety of Perſon is foreknown; in point of operation and agreement of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, farther than the tryals and experiments made upon the humane Nature of Bodies, with many other Perſons: and therefore every new invented, untryed Medicine, adapted to <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Caſe,</hi> are but preſumed, uncertain and unſafe; and it neceſſarily follows, that the <hi>Catholic</hi> and <hi>Specific</hi> Medicines, are much to be preferred, and more to be relied on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſufficiently tryed and proved, to agree and perform with many.</p>
            <p>And thus much in ſhort (yet much more is to be ſaid) concerning appropriated <hi>Recipe</hi>'s or <hi>Preſcripts,</hi> untried new Medicines, contrived with Pen and Ink, and tranſmitted to the Shops to be made up: being compared with the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Specificks,</hi> the Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceutick <hi>Arcana</hi>'s, ſtanding Medicines, repoſited in the Phyſicians Cloſet, being the reſult and perfection of long labour, induſtriouſly and carefully prepared in their own Laboratory, well proved and compleated, ready for Practice. And this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon the compariſon of Medicines in this triple diviſion; I make from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and my <hi>Experience</hi> in both the Modes of Practice, having firſt been converſant near ten years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the preſcribing Practice, making Experiments with Appropriate Medicines, <hi>pro re nata;</hi> and ſince, for above twenty years, operating in Medicinal Preparations (to be Maſter of <hi>Catholic</hi> and <hi>Specific</hi> Medicines, more ſecure and certain in their Operations) and practiſing therewith.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewed you the ſeveral diſtinct and bounded Latitudes, the aim and ſcope of Medicines, in their deſign of Adaptation to <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Caſes,</hi> and my Judgment thereupon; next we ſhall conſider Medicines, in their different manner of Operation or Working; how they aſſiſt Nature againſt all the Diſeaſes that aſſault and afflict her; and what effects we may rationally expect from their Power and Virtues. And here you will have before you, Natures Directory, for performing of Cures in all Diſeaſes that ſhall preſent; and how ſhe is to be relieved in her praeternatural State, and deviations from her right and regular Courſe.</p>
            <p>There are ſix Cardinal Operations, or principal wayes, by which Medicines do operate, for the diſcharge and throwing off all excremental, morbific matter, that is bred or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Body, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Purgation, Tranſpiration, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rination, Salivation, Expectoration</hi> and <hi>Corroboration;</hi> hereby to preſerve or reſtore Health decayed: and theſe are promoted and uſed in Nature's Method, which ſhe performs in the conſtant work of Nutrition; caſting out the relicks, and ſuperfluous matter of our food, not fit to be retained; ſhe works by <hi>ſtool, tranſpires, urines, ſalivates, expectorates;</hi> and laſtly <hi>corroborates,</hi> with the <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from <hi>Aliment;</hi> and this enables Nature to perform all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Now theſe <hi>Evacuations,</hi> and Roborating aſſiſtance, are to be promoted by Medicine, as Nature oppreſſed or decayed, doth chiefly require and ſtand in need of; ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other. In ſome Caſes, one of theſe Operations, duly proſecuted, with an excellent good Medicine, is ſufficient; as <hi>Purgation</hi> alone ſometimes doth all that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to reſtore the Perſon complaining: other conditions of Body may require two: as <hi>Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and alſo <hi>roborating</hi> the Faculties. Sometimes three ſeveral operations are required by turns: to reſtore loſt Health, and ſometimes four are needful; as in Contumacious and Complicated Diſeaſes, in difficult and decayed Bodies. And by this <hi>Method</hi> all Phyſicians ought to go with ſecure well proved Medicines; and thus all Cures are regularly to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and not otherwiſe, by various, uncertain, invented Medicines.</p>
            <p>Now theſe being the certain ways, and only chief <hi>Methods</hi> of Curing; the fruſtration and failing herein (as to the <hi>Phyſician</hi>'s part) is from the inſufficiency and defect of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, to operate compleatly thoſe Intentions. And ſince the deſign of Curing, moſt ſafely and moſt certainly, falls under ſuch a method and management as this; then it mainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33860:3"/>
the Phyſician, to be furniſhed with a ſtock of ſuch choice Medicines of his <hi>own</hi> elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, formed, reformed, and ſufficiently proved, wherewith to diſpatch his Undertakings ſatisfactorily, and with credit: and it as much concerns the <hi>Sick</hi> and <hi>Diſeaſed,</hi> to find out ſuch <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> from whom they may expect the greateſt help and relief, they are capable of; eſpecially in difficult and deplorable Caſes; and not to be <hi>Patient</hi> ſufferers, and tryers of conjectural new invented <hi>Recipe</hi>'s, and uncertain traditional <hi>Book</hi> Medicines, taken up upon truſt, collected from Authors, and tranſcribed from one another.</p>
            <p>There are three principal things which concerns a Phyſician to know, when he is ſent for to the <hi>ſick</hi> or <hi>diſeaſed;</hi> in any of which, if he fails, the <hi>Patient</hi> may miſcarry or linger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By <hi>queſtions,</hi> and by the <hi>ſymptoms</hi> that preſent, what the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> or Complication of Diſeaſes the Patient labours under.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What <hi>Operation,</hi> or <hi>Operations</hi> of Nature in Man's Body, are to be promoted, or aſſiſted; for relief in the preſent Caſe; and which to precede.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> With what <hi>Medicine,</hi> or <hi>Medicines,</hi> this Operation, or Operations, are to be performed by.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> That is to be done at the <hi>Patient</hi>'s Houſe, in his preſence. The two latter, at the <hi>Phyſician</hi>'s Houſe: he muſt make no Medicines with Pen and Ink in the Patient's Chamber; but return home, and there conſider of the operation indicated, and moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to give help in that Caſe; whether <hi>purging, ſweating, corroborating,</hi> &amp;c. otherwiſe: which having determined, the <hi>Medicine</hi> is to be ſent away immediately, if ſo requiring: and this Medicine ought to be ready prepared (by himſelf and Servants) and well proved, long before the uſe of it was wanted, or required.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Preſcriber,</hi> he makes Medicines upon a piece of Paper in the <hi>Sick</hi> Man's Chamber; and would have the <hi>Patient</hi> believe, that all his Complaints are put into the Medicine; ſomething for this, and ſomething for that, and another ingredient for the other ailment: but alas, here is a great miſtake, Medicines will not be deſigned and formed after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; Medicines are not to be made by <hi>Indications,</hi> though they are to be exhibited by <hi>Indications.</hi> You muſt not mix this and that together, as proper and ſuitable (in your Phancy) againſt this and that complicated Infirmity; the Medicinal Compoſition may then prove as diſcordant and diſorderly in it ſelf, as the Diſeaſes in the Patient's Body were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant, and exaſperating one another. Becauſe (you will ſay) the ingredients are all very good; therefore the Medicine muſt needs be very good: that's a <hi>non ſequitur.</hi> You muſt ſteer by another Compaſs, if ever you will arrive at the true <hi>knowledge</hi> of Medicines, or the right <hi>Method</hi> of Curing. After your <hi>Mode</hi> of gueſſing at Medicines, many an unlucky Medicine hath been invented; the effects whereof are too bad: but all muſt then be father'd upon the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> that was ſo intractable and malignant, as to produce ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ſtrange <hi>Symptoms:</hi> pertinent to this matter, take the following <hi>Story.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Calling at a Houſe, where formerly I had a Patient, there was one ſick at that time there; the People of the Houſe, being my acquaintance, deſired me to go up, and give my opinion of the <hi>Sick</hi> Perſon, which I refuſed, becauſe under the charge and cure of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Phyſician:</hi> but being importuned, I was prevailed upon, and did go into the Chamber; I viewed the ſick, and asked ſome Queſtions; underſtanding who the Phyſician was, a Man of good Learning and Repute, I gave him his due, and ſaid, he well knew what he had to do; and ſeeing ſome Glaſſes upon the Table; I taſted of one, with a Label, inſcribed, The <hi>Cordial:</hi> of a maukiſh, flat, and ſweet taſt, more likely to make a Stomach ſickiſh, than to refreſh and cheer a faint languiſhing Stomach. I took another Bottle, and taſted a few drops upon the Pallat, turning it about in my Mouth, but ſwallowed none; yet this ſo drew my Chaps together, with ſuch vehement aſtringency, that my breath was ſtopt a while, until I could recover my ſelf: If any one would give me a hundred Guineas, I durſt not take a Spoonful down, for fear of ſuffocation. I ſaid little; only that I did not like
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33860:3"/>
that Medicine; but my thoughts were full. Two or three days after, meeting a Servant of that Houſe in the ſtreet, I asked how that Patient did; the anſwer returned, ſhe was dead. Now theſe Medicines were preſcribed by gueſs, at a venture, and ill compoſed: or elſe the Apothecary, or his Servant, was highly in fault: but where the miſcarriage was, did not belong to me to examine; and ſo it paſt off. The <hi>Doctor</hi> was an able Man; the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary</hi> was an honeſt Man; and the <hi>Patient</hi> was become a dead Woman: and there is an end of the Story. But not a few ſuch Caſualties do fall out in the <hi>Preſcribing</hi> Practice; and many People can tell ſuch Melancholy Tales, ſomething like to this. The <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and unhappy <hi>Caſualties</hi> thereupon, in and about <hi>London,</hi> if a true account could be had, would make a Weekly Bill, not inconſiderable, but worth remarking.</p>
            <p>I ſee, and do hear of many learned <hi>Men,</hi> and yet I can ſee but a very few learned <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines:</hi> either they fail in the <hi>aſſociation;</hi> (an Ox and an Aſs cannot well draw together) or by <hi>diſproportion</hi> in quantities, or in the <hi>manner</hi> of Proceſs, and finiſhing. If Learning be not brought down into the Medicine, what ſignifies Learning in point of Curing; only a varniſh, and a flouriſh, to ſet off and dazel Folks Eyes: Let me ſee the Medicine, I'll tell you what the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Learning is worth, in the deſign of Curing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>great</hi> Men of the World, that can command all the aſſiſtance and help this <hi>Art</hi> can afford; and therefore deem themſelves the more ſecure; are oftentimes the moſt unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, under <hi>Phyſick,</hi> of all others; chiefly at the times of the <hi>greateſt</hi> danger, in <hi>acute</hi> and peracute Sickneſſes: having three or four, or more <hi>Phyſicians</hi> to attend them: each of them muſt put in for a ſhare, in deſigning and forming the Medicines: one will have this, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ingredient, and a third, ſomething elſe to be added: then the form of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and the <hi>Modus praeparandi,</hi> is not readily agreed upon, but diſſent and thwarting ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there, each Man ſtiff in his opinion, and loth to yield; but the urgency of the Caſe, admitting no delay, ſometimes forceth an <hi>abrupt</hi> Concluſion; not a free <hi>Conſent,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Concurrence.</hi> Now what can you expect from theſe <hi>Conſultations,</hi> and excogitated new <hi>Compoſitions,</hi> though deſigned by Men of Learning; for they themſelves can have no aſſurance in them, but an uncertain conjecture; no well grounded hope: and ſo long as Practice thus depends upon the <hi>Invention</hi> of Remedies, whoſe operations will be very <hi>Caſual,</hi> and then <hi>ſucceſs</hi> muſt needs be very <hi>dubious.</hi> And now, my <hi>Lord,</hi> you have but a <hi>Chance</hi> Medicine for all your <hi>Guineas;</hi> but that's not all the loſs; here is a caſt thrown for your Life: it may happen well, by the benign aſpect of your Stars; the good <hi>Providence</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects you; but not the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Skill: they put it upon the <hi>Venture;</hi> they can have no true knowledge of ſuch Appropriated Medicines; and what the reſult of their mixture will be, is but ſtrangely preſumed, and groundleſly hoped; being formed without a <hi>Rule,</hi> and not confirmed by experimented <hi>Proofs:</hi> for although the ſingle ingredients be good and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in themſelves, yet what their <hi>Concord</hi> will be in <hi>Compoſition,</hi> and what Concurrence to the intention aimed; nothing but <hi>Experience</hi> in the Tryal can determine. If then dubious Medicines be put upon dangerous Diſeaſes, the attempt ſeems deſperate, and the event looks fatal.</p>
            <p>If this be the Practice of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> then <hi>Phyſick</hi> ſhall never be practiſed (after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) upon me: then rather give me the Countryman's Pepper <hi>Poſſet,</hi> and I'll venture it that way. I don't like to die by <hi>Phyſick:</hi> then I ſhall know, whether my Diſeaſe be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal or not: but he that dies in the other chance Practice, who can tell, whether his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,</hi> or his <hi>Medicines,</hi> let him ſlip, or thruſt him out of the World. 'Tis a known ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Plures gula quam gladius:</hi> and I wiſh it were not as probably true, <hi>Plures Medicamenta quam morbus.</hi> I have a farther charge to exhibite againſt the Preſcribing Practice, which you may expect at my next opportunity: then the World ſhall ſee what they have doted on, and what they have truſted their lives with.</p>
            <p>In my former Sheet called, <hi>A ſerious Debate, relating to Health and Sickneſs:</hi> having there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33860:4"/>
ſet forth and aproved, that from the beginning, and for many hundred years after, <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> were all <hi>Preparers</hi> of Medicines for their own Practice. That <hi>Medicines</hi> were then celebrated with the Author's <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> for the People to reſort thither. That of later times, <hi>Phyſicians</hi> have imprudently departed from that laudable and exemplary cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom; and taken up the new Mode of preſcribing to the <hi>Shops:</hi> an innovation hazardous to the <hi>Patient,</hi> injurious to the <hi>Progreſs</hi> and Performance of this <hi>Art;</hi> rendring it uncertain and unſafe: and in the end will prove the ruine of the <hi>Profeſſors.</hi> That although illiterate <hi>Empericks</hi> have defamed the publiſhing of Medicines, by ſpreading their trifles abroad; yet the legal <hi>Phyſician</hi> is not to decline his duty, becauſe ſuch Interlopers incroach upon his Priviledges and right; for ſuch abuſes will happen in the beſt of things.</p>
            <p>And as for my ſelf, having deſerted the <hi>Preſcribing</hi> Practice near thirty years, and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Practice of the <hi>Antie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts;</hi> I there made mention of ſome Medicines of my own Preparation, conform to the <hi>Ancient</hi> Cuſtom of the moſt renowned <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> and there gave an account of their Virtues, Doſe, and manner of uſe; that thoſe who ſtand in need thereof, may know where ſuch help is to be had: which perhaps elſewhere, the like may not to be purchaſed. In vain it is diligently to labour a long time, and earneſtly purſue the acquiring of <hi>extraordinary</hi> means; and being attained, then to bury the ſucceſs in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and deprive the World of that relief, which many have languiſhed for want thereof, and now are dead.</p>
            <p>The Medicines named, were ſuch as moſt generally are wanted; <hi>viz. Scorbutic Pills,</hi> and a <hi>Reſtoring Elixir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pills, by their <hi>Purgative</hi> and <hi>Diuretick</hi> Operations, radically cleanſe and purify the Body, from all <hi>Scorbutic</hi> and degenerate humours: which being evacuated and drawn forth, the various <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> bred from thoſe Cauſes, muſt needs wither, and will daily leſſen, if duly proſecuted: They fitly apply to moſt Caſes, requiring <hi>Purgation</hi> and <hi>urinary</hi> eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, and readily ſerve upon all emergent occaſions, or ſeaſonable preventions; opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with great eaſe and ſafety, in young or aged, and the tendereſt or weakeſt Perſons, the Doſe being ſuitable. And being of ſuch great uſe, and durable in keeping; ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident People, do keep them as neceſſary proviſion, to be ready, and not to ſeek them at the time of need.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reſtoring Elixir</hi> performs a different operation from the <hi>Pills;</hi> but is frequently uſed by turns with them: for as they by cleanſing carry of the impurities and noxious humours that oppreſs, clog, and obſtruct the functions of ſeveral <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> from perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their office; ſo this aſſiſting <hi>Elixir</hi> is very uſeful, to quicken, ſtrengthen, and raiſe up the faculties that are languid and weak; to rectify and reinforce them, when declining and deviating; giving an additional ſtrength, for reducing them again into the true execution of their offices.</p>
            <p>☞ I there alſo mentioned a Medicine very uſeful and proper for <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe frequent in that Country, and other Diſeaſes uſually attending <hi>Camps</hi> and <hi>Navies,</hi> which have proved ſo mortal to many now of late; which gives me cauſe to think, the Medicinal help hath not been ſo fit, and efficacious, as ought to be. If people of the beſt rank be meanly ſerv'd at home, though purchaſed at a conſiderable Charge; what will not ſerve to fill up a <hi>Cheſt,</hi> to be ſent abroad for the uſe of <hi>Souldiers</hi> and <hi>Seamen?</hi> the formality of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is enough; they did not die without the uſe of Medicines; and to alter this courſe, is againſt ſome Mens Intereſts; therefore any thing elſe propoſed, though ten times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it ſhall be oppoſed and ſtifled. I wiſh ſo well to the publick ſervice, that my zeal makes me bold to offer my ſentiments, which I hope will not be reſented ill, becauſe intended well.</p>
            <p>But I hear, there is care taken for a better ſupply; that ten Phyſicians are put upon the work. If they be <hi>Pharmacopoeians,</hi> Operators in Medicines; I ſhall expect ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33860:4"/>
from them; but otherwiſe, if Readers of Medicines, and only Book Learned; I expect no more than the reſult of other Conſultations; conjectural, preſumed, chance <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</hi> I cannot well think, how a compleat, adapt Medicine, ſhould be made by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation,</hi> unleſs the occaſion requiring, could wait upon many Adjournments, and days of tryal; to prove, reform, and meliorate their firſt invention: for many a Medicine that hath been thought very good and promiſing upon the projection, hath been found mean up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tryal, and rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One</hi> Mans <hi>experience</hi> in a Medicine, is <hi>better than ten</hi> Mens <hi>invention</hi> of a Medicine: take that for an <hi>Aphoriſm.</hi> And <hi>one</hi> Man ſometimes finds out that, which a <hi>hundred</hi> cannot; and <hi>thouſands</hi> never did. Here are ten Mens <hi>Heads,</hi> but where are the <hi>Hands?</hi> The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries</hi> are to find Hands: If <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Hands</hi> do not go together, I doubt the Medicines will be <hi>ſpurious.</hi> But farther, you'l ſay, here will be <hi>ten</hi> Mens <hi>experience,</hi> and that's ſurer than <hi>one</hi> Mans: but then conſider how hard a thing, and almoſt impoſſible it is, that the experience of <hi>many</hi> in the form, and methodical uſe of Medicines, ſhould run ſo even, and repreſent each other in uniformity and likeneſs; but there muſt be ſome grains of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for diſparity here and there, to piece them together, for an accord and union of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> to ſtamp the certainty of one <hi>homogeneous</hi> experience upon them; and when that is done, I ſay, all theſe <hi>experiences,</hi> ſo modelled, and reduced into one <hi>Maſſe,</hi> cannot be truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led concurring experience, <hi>in omnibus,</hi> that deſerves a <hi>Probatum eſt,</hi> and a true Copy to form experienced Medicines by; but you muſt call it a probable experiment to be made; and as yet wants Confirmation by proofs. If it be ſo, as in reaſon it is; then I muſt ſay, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive ſingle Medicine, well approved by one Mans Experience <hi>(ſi ſit Artifex)</hi> is more to be relied on, than a Method of Medicines, from ſuch a compounded Experience of many. But if I prove, you can make no true obſervation in your new Mode of Practice, and your experience not grounded thereupon; your judgment muſt needs appear fallacious, and the eſſential part of your ability taken away: for what is it that makes a <hi>Phyſician</hi> able and ſecure in practice, but <hi>experience</hi> founded upon true <hi>obſervations:</hi> and without this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he is but as a Novice, an uncertain conjecturing Man in the methods of Curing, although an ancient Practiſer. But this I muſt proſecute in my next.</p>
            <p>Since all Learning, reaſoning, and deſigning of Medicines, muſt give way, and yield up to <hi>Experience;</hi> than which nothing ſo certain to depend on; I muſt then prefer my ſingle tryed Remedy, before the methods of any learned <hi>Conſultation</hi> whatever. Having ſeen the proofs thereof, and manner of operation, in various, difficult, and deplorable Caſes: one whereof was my <hi>own,</hi> and the condition ſo deſperate, as I would not wade through the like again, for a heap of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Diamonds:</hi> when all hopes in other Medicines failed, this alone reſcued me <hi>(Deo juvante)</hi> performing the whole courſe, and anſwering all the indications that remarkable cure required. The ſtory too long to inſert here; or the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious</hi> Diſeaſes of others, in which this Medicine hath relieved. One part of its uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and excellency lyes here; that it is eaſily managed; whereas <hi>Methods</hi> of Medicines, being various, both in <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Medicine;</hi> they always require the attendance of a Phyſician, upon each particular ſick Perſon, which cannot be allowed to an <hi>Army</hi> marching, or diſperſed into Quarters, or a Fleet at Sea. And as for internal Ulcers, or Wounds made by Gun-ſhot, or Inſtrument, where the Surgeon's hand cannot come to dreſs, but muſt depend upon <hi>internal</hi> means; this promotes digeſtion in the wounded part, and alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth the purulent matter, or quittour; performing the office of a <hi>Balſam,</hi> and diſpoſeth to healing: and if a Surgeon hath ſuch an <hi>expedient</hi> as this to work with, it facilitates and ſets forward his buſineſs with all imaginable ſafety. This is no new <hi>Invention</hi> (to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure) contrived upon the preſent expedition and juncture of Affairs; but I can prove it was fortunately deſigned ſome years ſince, upon an extraordinary emergent occaſion; with its uſe and ſucceſſes in various caſes afterwards in Practice. So that I offered nothing upon bare
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33860:5"/>
projection and rational probability, but grounded upon matters of fact, the greateſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that can be given to ſupport the credit of a Medicine.</p>
            <p>I am the more free upon the <hi>Character</hi> of this Medicine (yet not the half of what I have to ſay) becauſe I mentioned it as moſt advantagious for the <hi>Publick</hi> Service; that you may not think I offered a <hi>trifle,</hi> or what is ordinary: I wiſh there may be ſuch a Medicine found in the Medicinal <hi>Apparatus,</hi> for Army or Navy; but I do not expect it. As for <hi>Contagious</hi> Diſeaſes, which oftentimes do infeſt Armies and Fleets (the cauſes whereof I could aſſign) and begets great Mortality, and this for want of a right underſtanding thereof, good, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive, and curative means, and due Adminiſtration; but few are fitted for this work. I have ſeen the higheſt Contagion that hath been known in <hi>England</hi> (Plague at <hi>London,</hi> 1665.) and voluntarily ingaged therein from <hi>firſt</hi> to <hi>laſt)</hi> when moſt Phyſicians ran away, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the people in that Calamity: But I being provided with Antidotes preventive and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and knowing it was my Duty, I therefore feared nothing; and viſited thoſe People, ſeized with the Peſtilence (as I do now any other Diſeaſe) my ſelf remaining in good health during the Contagion.</p>
            <p>I wiſh for a ſight of the Catalogue of Medicines deſigned for the ſervice; then I could ſay ſomething more in this matter.</p>
