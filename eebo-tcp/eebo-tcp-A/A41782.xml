            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> having taught the Chriſtian Churches in <hi>Creet</hi> their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties towards God, and towards <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and leaving <hi>Titus</hi> (a Meſſenger of the Churches) behind him there, very ſtrictly warns him to put them in mind of their Subjection <hi>to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, and Powers, and to obey Magiſtrates.</hi> Knowing how impoſſible it would be to propagate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, if Chriſtians did not adorn their Profeſſion with a meek and harmleſs Converſation towards all Men, and eſpecially by their Obedience to thoſe in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>And conſidering the manifold Temptations that attend Chriſtians in theſe days upon that account, I thought it my Duty, as one that has obtained Mercy to be faithful, to do my beſt in giving warning to my Brethren, leſt any of them ſhould be enſnared with ill Principles, or ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, to ſpeak or do any thing that may be inconſiſtent with Goſpel-Rules, either in things relating more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to Almighty God, or to the King's Majeſty, and thoſe that are in Authority under him.</p>

Such heady Perſons there were in the Apoſtle's Days, and therefore the leſs ſtrange if now ſome ſuch be found in the beſt of Churches, as are not afraid to ſpeak Evil of Dignities: All Ages and ſorts of Chriſtians have been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſuch Evil-Workers. And as it hath been the care of faithful Men all along to proteſt againſt them, that the Truth (which ſuch Wretches only prophane by their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it) might not be worſe thought of becauſe of them; So let it be our care to bear a faithful Teſtimony against all ſuch in theſe Days.</p>

               <p>THis great Apoſtle, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> having preached Chriſt in many Countries, thought it meet to leave ſome Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his holy Doctrine with all the Churches. And having in two ſacred Epiſtles aſſured them of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Doctrine which he had preached, and that it was no Fable or new Device, but the very Truth which from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God made known to his Prophets: He then exhorts them to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43526:5"/>
Stedfaſtneſs, and to hope to the end for the grace or fulneſs of Glory, which ſhall be brought to all true Chriſtians at the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſecond coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He warns them to beware of Sin, chiefly that root of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Envy and Hypocriſy, (for theſe are uſually complicated in one): for as it gave being to all our Miſery, and has been all along the ruine of Nations, Churches, and Communities; ſo we are advertiſed that it will abound towards the end of the World.</p>
               <p>To avoid this damning Iniquity, we are willed to conſider our new Birth, and as new-born Babes to evidence our delight to be in the ſincere Milk of the Word of God, not in the Vanities of this World, where we are but Pilgrims and Strangers; aſſuring us, that as Chriſt is the ſure Foundation to ſupport his Church: So, (however ſome Builders do ſet him at naught) he is the Head of the Corner, and will certainly in time confound the Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, leſt Chriſtians ſhould be too impatient of the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delay of Chriſt's Exaltation, and of the manifold Tribulations which in the mean time they muſt ſuffer; he further warns them to be of an obedient and ſubmiſſive Spirit to ſuch as are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to adorn their Profeſſion, by an honeſt Converſation, as the beſt way to ſilence their Oppoſers; <hi>For ſo is the Will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh Men,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 15. For tho it be very true that all Chriſtians are the Lord's Freemen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 22. yet they may not maliciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe any Man, nor diſhonour any Man, much leſs any that are in Authority: Chriſtianity being indeed the greateſt Obligation that any Man can be under, to preſerve and chearfully to give to all their Dues, in reſpect of Love, Honour, Fear, Tribute, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God is to have the things which are God's, Princes the things which are theirs, and all Men (as well thoſe that are not Chriſtians as thoſe that are) muſt have that Love and Honour which is their Due even from the Servants of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus then we approach the Text; which calls upon us to <hi>Honour all Men, Love the Brotherhood,</hi> to <hi>Fear God,</hi> and to <hi>Honour the King.</hi> In which Directions is briefly contained the whole duty of a Chriſtian Man. As,</p>

               <p>In opening theſe Words, we ſhall conſider the genuine import of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Honour all Men.</hi> (1.) The Word <hi>Honour</hi> here, according to the Greek, may be underſtood thus, <hi>Eſteem all Men highly, value all Men at an high Price, or count them precious:</hi> And hence, <hi>Tremelius</hi> reads the place <hi>Omnem Hominem in Honore habite,</hi> have all Men in high Eſteem or Honour. And in this Direction is implied that lowly and gracious Spirit, that friendly and amicable Temper which all Chriſtians ſhould have and evidence towards Mankind: for he that is not of a lowly Spirit, cannot Honour all Men. (2.) By <hi>All Men,</hi> we muſt not here admit of the exception of any Man as ſuch; but foraſmuch as they are all the Off-ſpring of God, it is the Will of God that a due eſteem be given to them all, as the moſt noble part of his Creation under the Sun;<hi>—And but a little lower than the Angels,</hi> Pſal. 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Love the Brotherhood.</hi> By Love here we may ſafely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, a more ſpecial kind of Love than that which we owe to all Men, which is well expreſſed, in the 2 <hi>Epiſt. of John, Whom I love in the Truth, for the Truths ſake which dwelleth in us.</hi> Hence ſome of our Tranſlators render the Words thus, <hi>Love Brotherly Fellowſhip.</hi> And the Rhemiſts tells us, that <hi>This Speech often commendeth the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all Chriſtians among themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Fear God.</hi> The Original imports an awful dread, or ſuch a Fear as cauſeth Trembling; and 'tis the ſame Word uſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. where it is evident ſuch a Fear is intended: <hi>But rather fear him which is able to deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell.</hi> By the Fear of God therefore in this place, we muſt underſtand the dutiful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of his revealed Will (for ſo the Fear of God is ſometimes taken) as ever we expect to ſee his Face with Comfort: and here the Fear of Man is excluded, becauſe it brings a Snare, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 25. and is a fatal prevention to the Service of God.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43526:6"/>
4. <hi>Honour the King.</hi> (1.) The Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does not barely ſignify Honour, or Eſteem, in this place; but a magnificent or ſplendid kind of Honour: for ſo hath the Lord ordained for his Vicegerents, giving them the Title of Gods in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 6. (2.) It is carefully to be conſidered what <hi>King</hi> is immediately meant in our Text: he could be no King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had failed long before this Epiſtle was written; and tho Chriſt was born King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet he did not enter upon his Regality with reſpect to the Government of that, nor any other Nation: but plainly tells us, <hi>His Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> Nor did the Apoſtle ſpeak of any Chriſtian King, for as yet <hi>None of the Princes of this World knew Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here immediately intended was an Heathen King, the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who at that time (as Hiſtorians relate) was both of very wicked Life, and Idolatrous in his Religion, calling himſelf <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> as being chief about the Worſhip of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> And yet, S. <hi>Peter</hi> will have him honoured even by thoſe who had put themſelves under the Yoak of Chriſt, their Heavenly King. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly requires the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. Wherefore from the Text thus explained, we ſhould learn theſe four things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. <hi>That Chriſtians muſt by no means be of an haughty, ſcornful, nor wrathful Spirit towards any Man; but of an humble and gentle Behaviour, to pay the Debt of Honour to all, and to eſteem them precious.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>Brotherly Fellowſhip, Love and Concord, are to be ſought for, and maintained by all Chriſtians, one with another, as ſuch.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. <hi>Chriſtians muſt have an awful Fear of God before their Eyes, that in Matters of Religion they may ſerve him only, and not provoke him by ſinful Courſes, nor by the Fear of Man.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. <hi>Chriſtians are bound by Goſpel-Rules to be good Subjects to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to honour their Perſons, and conſcienciouſly to obey their Authority.</hi>
                  </item>

               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43526:6"/>
Theſe Propoſitions do harmonize with the Doctrine which is according to Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt; That Chriſtians muſt by no means (as they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their claim to the venerable Title of <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and to any part in the Kingdom of Chriſt) be of an haughty, ſcornful or wrathful Spirit againſt any Man, is a Doctrine needful to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by an heavenly Herald, by the Voice of an Archangel, even to that part of the World called <hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> For who can ſufficiently bewail the almoſt utter Abſence of this gracious Spirit, which abounded in the Author and firſt Profeſſors of Chriſtianity; and the undeniable Appearance of a Spirit of a quite contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at this day, in all parts of the World where Chriſt is named? From whence come Wars and Fightings? Come they not hence, even from Pride? as it is written, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>Only by Pride cometh Contention.</hi> What greater Injuries, Indignities, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours can be offered by Mortals one towards another, than are amongſt the ſeveral Orders profeſſing Chriſtianity? yea, very often by Men of the ſame Order, one towards another? So very far are the generality of Chriſtians from obeying the Voice of our Text. And look how far they are gone from the Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Tenderneſs, which leads all that have it to eſteem Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind very precious; ſo far they have loſt the Chriſtian Religion, as will appear in proving the firſt Propoſition. To which purpoſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhall give precendency to our Lord Chriſt, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an haughty Spirit peeping forth in his choſen Diſciples, even then whilſt the very Mirror of Meekneſs and Humility was before their Eyes, does ſolemnly denounce unto them, (and in them to all Chriſtians) that <hi>except they were converted, and became as little Children, they ſhould by no means enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Luke 18. 15. And therewithal gives notice of a Wo impending or coming upon the World, from that Spirit of Pride and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in this ſo early an appearance of it, which yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeems to have over-run the Church in all Ages, to the Scandal of Religion. But would ſo ſmall a Fault in the choſen Diſciples, (as it may ſeem, in reſpect of that which is now every where to be found) ſhut Heaven againſt them, unleſs thoſe converted Souls were converted in that Caſe? Let us tremble to think of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:43526:7"/>
It's clear from this Inſtance, that ſuch as are of an haughty Mind, cannot honour all Men. They are Bladders puffed up with this Wind; break this Bladder, there is meer Emptineſs. Their Goodneſs vaniſhes, when they cannot lift themſelves above others. Whereas the truly gracious Soul ſtudies how to ſerve God, and all Men for his ſake; and thus to honour them, is the greateſt Reſpect that any Chriſtian can give to Men. Thus did our Lord himſelf honour all: <hi>He took upon him the form of a Servant.</hi> Phil. 2. 7. And indeed his great Deſign in his Life and Doctrine, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Mankind to a State of Grace, and Reconciliation with God, and thereby to Amity and Concord one with another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next to our Saviour, let us hear his beloved Diſciple <hi>John.</hi> He often ſpeaks to the whole Church under the Title of <hi>Little Children;</hi> and the Metaphor is very fit for Chriſtians, as in other reſpects, ſo chiefly in this, to put them in mind, they muſt in no wiſe be of a lofty and wrathful Spirit. He tells us, the Love of God is not in thoſe Men, who have the Pride of Life in them, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 15, 16. They cannot honour, eſteem, or count all Men precious, till that Image of Chriſt, which ſtandeth in Humility, be formed in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 32, 33. does not only teach the Brotherhood, that they muſt <hi>ſhew all Meekneſs to all Men, and give no Offence to Jew nor Gentile;</hi> but puts himſelf (as becomes all true Miniſters of Chriſt) for a Patern to the Flock. <hi>Tho</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I be free from all Men, yet I have made my ſelf Servant unto all, that I might gain the more.—I am made all Things to all Men, that I might by all means ſave ſome.</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. How precious did he count the Jewiſh Nation! (tho they generally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him) he could be content to be undone himſelf, rather than they ſhould be loſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 1. And no leſs concern'd for the poor Gentiles, that they alſo might be happy. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 16. And hitherto did tend the Scope of all his Labours, to <hi>warn, teach,</hi> and to <hi>preſent every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Col. 1. 28.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And foraſmuch as the Tongue is the ordinary Witneſs of the Spirit of Pride, and that whereby all Men are incident to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour one another, he ſtrictly obligeth all Chriſtians to <hi>let their Speech be always with Grace, ſeaſoned with Salt, that they may admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Grace to them that hear them.</hi> Col. 4. 6. And he that will obey our Text, to <hi>honour</hi> all Men, muſt remember <hi>that he ſpeak evil of no Man,</hi> (an Impiety which God knows even reigns amongſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43526:7"/>
Chriſtians.) <hi>The Tongue is an unruly Member, a World of Iniquity.</hi> And hence the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> is very bold, telling us, our Religion is vain, if we bridle not that Member. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. How can that Tongue be fit to bleſs God, to profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, which is exerciſed in curſing, ſpeaking evil, or wiſhing ill to any Man? <hi>My Brethren, theſe Things ought not to be. Doth a Fountain give ſweet Water and bitter at the ſame place?</hi> This is not to be found in Nature, nor to be expected in Grace. Chriſtians muſt be known to all Men by their Fruits of Righteouſneſs, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Goodneſs, and Faith; otherwiſe Men ſhall never be moved to glorify God in their behalf.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Chriſtian who will honour all Men, muſt love all Men; without this, he cannot eſteem them, nor count them precious. Whom we love not, we have no delight to honour. It is in a manner peculiar to the Chriſtian Doctrine, that Men ſhould love their Enemies, pray for them that perſecute them and deſpitefully uſe them. Let us therefore pay this Debt, to honour all Men in Love. He that will do this, muſt bear Mankind upon his Heart in Prayer and Supplication. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. This is a Leſſon for Chriſtians, as ſuch, they muſt love their Neighbours as themſelves, and all Men are their Neighbours. The Royal Law obliges them to it; <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>If ye fulfill the Royal Law according to the Scriptures, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf, ye do well; but if ye have reſpect to Perſons,</hi> (that is, love one, and hate another) <hi>ye commit Sin, and are convinced of the Law as Tranſgreſſors.</hi> Were Chriſtians filled more with this Fruit of the Spirit, we ſhould ſee an end of theſe Animoſities, opprobrious and abuſive Epithets, or Brands of Reproach and Infamy, which are daily caſt upon Men, and too frequently found among Chriſtian Men. It is to be lamented, that Men who are precious in the eſteem of God, ſhould not be eſteemed ſo by one another.</p>
               <p>But <hi>honour all Men,</hi> ſays our Text; and the Arguments to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Duty are many, of which, ſome we will urge in this place, and the firſt ſhall be this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> They are Men as well as our ſelves, our Equals by Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the Workmanſhip of the Hands of the ſame God; and therefore are we bound to honour all Men, as Men; nor can we ſlight, deſpiſe, or diſhonour them, but we diſhonour our ſelves:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43526:8"/>
For they are Fleſh of our Fleſh, and <hi>God hath made of one Blood all Nations of Men, to dwell upon the Face of the Earth;</hi> and he is the <hi>God of the Spirits of all Fleſh.</hi> And thus we have all one Father; as one God hath created us, <hi>we are all his Off-ſpring:</hi> not as ſome prophanely have ſaid, that Man is no more God's Off-ſpring than an Hog; for he did not conſult the Creation of any thing, as he did the Creation of Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. Nor did he breath into the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils of Hogs, the ſame Spirit of Life and Wiſdom which he breathed into Man. <hi>David</hi> admires the Goodneſs of God in the degnified State of Man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 4, 5. And let us beware of baſe thoughts concerning Man, leſt we value him no more than the Beaſts of the Field, and ſo diſhonour him, whom God created in great Honour, and to this day (notwithſtanding his Fall) hath ſet him over the Works of his Hands. All Men are our Brethren, let us honour them as ſuch; for what Brotherhood ſoever we attain, yet our humane Fraternity is antecedent, and not made void by any Poſt-Fraternity, which is good, but rather more indeared. This was ſeen in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the nearer his Relation was to God upon the account of Chriſtianity, the more was his Love, and the greater his Sorrow for his Brethren according to the Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 2. Let not Chriſtians think, that their Relation, nor Obligation of Nature to Mankind, is deſtroyed or made leſs, by their being Chriſtians; ſuch a vain Conceit will alienate us from our own Fleſh, and make us quite pervert the Text, which puts us in mind that our Religion does ſtrongly engage us to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them all. It was a Vertue in the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> who would not be accounted of this or that Nation, Tribe, or City, but entitled himſelf a <hi>Citizen of the whole World;</hi> meaning, he had an equal reſpect for Mankind; and if his Relation might be an Honour, he would be related to them all, that he might honour them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> Chriſtains muſt honour all Men, becauſe God himſelf hath honoured them all, ſetting his Love upon them, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting it to them, and that divers ways: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the common Acts of his Providence, of which we have an excellent Account in the 107th Pſalm, to which I refer you. It is he that giveth them fruitful Seaſons, filling their Hearts with Joy and Gladneſs; he gives them Life and Breath, and all things. Hence they (even all Nations) are called his People, and the <hi>Sheep of his Paſture,</hi> Pſal. 100. 1, 2. and upon this very ground
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43526:8"/>
are required to pay their Debt of Thankfulneſs unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God has greatly honoured Mankind in the gracious Act of Redemption; I ſay, in this he has greatly <hi>eſteemed all Men, and counted them very precious.</hi> That God hath done this for <hi>all Men,</hi> nothing can be more plain than theſe Teſtimonies: <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Man, who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 6. <hi>We ſee Jeſus made a little lower than the Angels, for the ſuffering of Death.—That he by the Grace of God ſhould taſte Death for every Man.</hi> Heb. 2. 9. <hi>For all have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God, being juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Rom. 3. 23, 24. <hi>He is a Propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> Surely he that againſt the Light of theſe plain Teſtimonies, can or will think that God neglected the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part, or any part of Mankind, in the moſt important Buſineſs of Redemption, muſt needs have a very low eſteem and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thoughts of that part of Mankind, cannot value them much above the fallen Angels or Devils, for whom no Ranſom was given; and conſequently they cannot <hi>honour all Men.</hi> The Devils are but Sinners, ſhut up to the Judgment of Eternal Fire, without means of Recovery; and theſe Men, that narrow up the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Man to the Elect only, ſhut up the remainder of Men in that Condemnation which is inevitable. And what Honour can belong to ſuch? How ſhould we count them precious, if indeed God hated them from all Eternity? It is not ſaying, <hi>That we know them not by Name, and therefore ought to honour all Men,</hi> that will ſalve the Buſineſs: For the truth is, if we heartily honour all Men, we muſt be <hi>ſure</hi> that God would have us do ſo; and of this we cannot be ſure, if we think God made them only to damn them: For if the Eſteem or Honour which we give to all Men, proceed not from ſincere Love to them, and Deſire of their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, it is but Hypocriſy, no true Honour; for the Honour which we owe to all Men, is not founded upon any thing wherein they are dignified above us, but upon thoſe Bleſſings or Favours from God, which are common to us all, and wherein he has made no difference between one and another. And therefore if we truly eſteem, love, and wiſh all Men well in the Caſe of their Salvation, me muſt believe that God does ſo too, or elſe we cannot do it hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Speech here is worthy of Remembrance; <hi>O vehement Love! that God for Man's cauſe can vouchſafe to become</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:43526:9"/>
                  <hi>Man! Who can hate Man, whoſe Nature and Likeneſs he beholds in the Humanity of God?</hi> Surely, if God has not loved all Men in Chriſt, we have no cauſe to count them precious, becauſe we ſee them not favoured in the Humanity of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That our God counts <hi>all Men</hi> precious, may be ſeen in the Order given, that the Word of Peace or Reconciliation may be preached to <hi>all Men,</hi> or, to every Creature; to be <hi>made known to all Nations for the Obedience of Faith.</hi> Mat. 28. 19. Rom. 16. 26. Surely this Meſſage, with the Meſſenger and Meſſengers that brought it to <hi>all Men,</hi> does ſtupendouſly evidence, how precious God accounts all Men. He may juſtly demand, What could have been done to evidence my Love to Man, and the precious Eſteem I have of him, which I have not done. Has he not ſent his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, whoſe Words have gone to the <hi>uttermoſt parts of the Earth? Rom.</hi> 10. Yea, he hath ſent his Son, whom he hath made Heir of all Things; yea, he hath ſent thus to thoſe that would not accept theſe Tokens of Love, Eſtimation, or Honour. <hi>John</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 38. Surely it is an Act of Honour towards the Party viſited, when the King comes to viſit the Beggar, yea, the Traytor. <hi>Whence is this to me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Elizabeth, that the Mother of my Lord ſhould come to me?</hi> And whence is this to Man, or what Honour hath God conferred upon Man, that our Lord himſelf ſhould come to Man, to redeem him by the Death of the Croſs, and to make all Men ſee what is the Fellowſhip of this myſterious Piece of Godlineſs, <hi>(which is God manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.) by the Light of the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>Thirdly; <hi>Chriſtians muſt honour all Men, becauſe this is one effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way to recommend the Way of Chriſtianity, or the Truth which we profeſs, to the acceptance of all Men.</hi> And hitherto may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe and the like Rules; <hi>Walk in Wiſdom towards them that are without. If you ſalute your Brethren only, what do you more than others? The Servant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle towards all Men. Render to no Man Evil for Evil, but overcome Evil with Good. Shewing all Meekneſs to all Men. Giving a Reaſon of the Hope that is in you, with Meekneſs and Fear.</hi> That Chriſtian that ſhall walk towards all Men according to theſe Rules, ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour all Men, and greatly recommend the Truth to them all; for thus ſhall he himſelf become an Epiſtle of Chriſt, <hi>read and known of all Men.</hi> 1. Cor. 3. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:43526:9"/>
I ſhall conclude this firſt Doctrine with a ſolemn Proteſtation againſt all ſuch as would ſet up their Religion by Violence, Blood, and Treachery, by what Name ſoever diſtinguiſhed; for if this be their Scope, they have not known Chriſt, nor the Divine Power of Chriſtianity. <hi>Cain</hi> leads the Van to this unreaſonable Troop, who never did nor can <hi>honour all Men,</hi> till they be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from this Principle: No, they deſire to kill, that they only might be honoured. By this unchriſtian ſort of Chriſtians, what unſpeakable Butcheries have been committed! Hundreds of Thouſands in a neighbouring Nation, in this Age, cruelly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. What Hangings, Burnings, and Tormentings all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> over! And this pretendedly to advance Holy Church! As if our Saviour's Houſe muſt be built with Blood, when yet he plainly tells us, he came not to kill Men, but to ſave them, and ſharply rebukes his Diſciples, when ſuch a Spirit appeared in them.</p>
               <p>And have we not ſeen a refined Generation, (as they would be thought) peeping forth, with the Name of Blood, or the <hi>ſmiting Principle,</hi> written on their Forehead, with direction to their Proſelites to pray, that God would deſtroy all Oppreſſior and <hi>Oppreſſors</hi> from off the face of the Earth? Lord! what is this? The greateſt part of Mankind peradventure are Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in one thing or other; and muſt a Chriſtian pray for their Deſtruction, or for their Converſion? Sure the latter is the Duty of all Chriſtians. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. They cannot deſire ſuch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Day, but that Mercy may be extended, knowing that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were <hi>ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, living in Malice, hateful, and hating one another.</hi> Tit. 3. But alas! do not theſe Men pray for their own Deſtruction? Who ſees not that ſuch a Principle is pregnant with Oppreſſion? O let all Chriſtians beware of it. And let us <hi>pray for them that hate us, perſecute us, and ſpeak all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Evil againſt us falſly, for his Names ſake, who hath called us not only to believe, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus leaving all Men of bloody, violent, and treacherous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to conſider what Spirit they are of; how unlike our Lord Chriſt; how different from the Primitive Chriſtians; how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Humanity it ſelf, which teaches all to do to others (not as they do) but as we would they ſhould do to us: We ſhall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43526:10"/>
proceed to the next Point of Doctrine, grounded upon the ſecond Direction in the Text, <hi>Love the Brotherhood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doct. II. <hi>Brotherly Fellowſhip, Love and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is carefully to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured and maintained by all Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Brotherhood being not natural, but ſpiritual and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, admits of a twofold Conſideration:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In the largeſt Sence the Word (and Uſe of it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) will bear.</item>
                  <item>2. In a more ſtrict and ſpecial Sence.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In the firſt, we muſt comprehend all that own the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for the Rule of Faith, believing in the only true God, the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>(for theſe three are one);</hi> that Chriſt died for our Sins, and roſe again for our Juſtification; that live ſoberly, according to the general Rules of Chriſtianity, tho they may be diverſly perſuaded in the Methods of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Worſhip. Or I could be content, (if the State of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity would bear it in theſe Days) to expreſs my ſelf in this Caſe in the Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 2. <hi>All that in every place call upon the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> among whom he found Diverſities of Opinions, as well as Diſorders in practice of Ordinances. Not that he allows either, but labours to reform both, yet ſo as he would preſerve Amity among them as they were Brethren, tho ſome of them were carnal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. others allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves a very dangerous Liberty in religious Matters, even to eat Things ſacrificed to Idols; ſome doubting of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, others very looſe in their Devotion at the Lord's Table; they were ſome tumultuous, others otherwiſe vicious, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Now whether the Apoſtle, in his Exhortations to Unity, intends, that notwithſtanding theſe Errors they ſhould hold ample Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Erroneous; or whether, upon adhering to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof by him given, and their obeying the Epiſtles which he ſent to them, he obliges them to maintain and uphold their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is the Buſineſs to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>The firſt it is not like to be, for then few Errors, either in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Life, could break this brotherly Fellowſhip among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And then to what purpoſe are theſe Rules given? <hi>Mark</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:43526:10"/>
                  <hi>them which cauſe Diviſions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them.</hi> Rom. 16. 17. <hi>Withdraw your ſelves from every Brother which walks diſorderly,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Theſſ. 3. 6. Surely all that can be required, as to Unity with theſe Chriſtians, is a brotherly Compaſſion, to encourage what we can the Truth they hold, or the Good they do; to hold with them in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe of Chriſtianity, againſt the common Enemy of it. I conceive the latter to be the only ſafe way, <hi>viz.</hi> That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their great Carnality, Weakneſs of Judgment, or Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs in their erroneous Opinions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if now they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Counſel of the Lord's Meſſenger, or which the Lord by his Meſſenger had ſent unto them, that then the Brotherhood once found among them ſhould ſtill continue, tho they had too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently forfeited their Privileges. Thus to take the Apoſtle's meaning, is to make him harmonize with himſelf. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>If any Man obey not our Word by this Epiſtle, note that Man, and have no Company with him, that he may be aſhamed; yet count him not an Enemy, but admoniſh him as a Brother.</hi> But to take the Apoſtle in the firſt Sence, would make him irreconcileable to or with himſelf. So then, <hi>Paul</hi> did not adviſe the Faithful at <hi>Corinth,</hi> to hold am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Communion with thoſe of ill Life, and erroneous Principles in the neceſſary parts of Religion, ſuch as the Reſurrection, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from Idolatry doubtleſs are; for he that denies the firſt, <hi>denies Chriſt to be riſen, makes the Apoſtles falſe Witneſſes, and the Faith of Chriſtians vain.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3. And the ſecond makes Men uncapable to ſerve God: <hi>Ye cannot drink the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Idols (or Devils.)</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
               <p>Let us then conſider the ſecond, or more ſtrict Sence of the Word, <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> in our Text. And here we muſt take it, as it pertains to truly conſtituted and well-governed Societies of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:</hi> For undoubtedly God intended to have the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſtated and maintained in all Nations, according to the priſtine Simplicity of the Goſpel, without the mixtures of Legal Ceremonies, or humane Innovations: For when Jeſus gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Apoſtles, to <hi>teach all Nations, baptizing them;</hi> and then, <hi>to teach them to obſerve all Things whatſoever he commanded them.</hi> Mat. 28. 19, 20. and gave being to this Order, to continue to the end of the World, it muſt needs be highly rational on the part of all ſuch, as do piouſly ſtand to this Form of Doctrine, as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43526:11"/>
explicated and delivered to the Churches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. And conſequently it muſt needs be very pleaſing to God, and commendable in the Church, that his Inſtitutes be kept with the greateſt exactneſs, <hi>as they were delivered at first,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2.</p>
               <p>For if once Variations in either the Doctrinal or Practical Parts of the Chriſtian Religion be admitted, there can be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain duration of any Truth. <hi>A little Leaven leaveneth the whole Lump,</hi> Gal. 5. 7. And this the Apoſtle ſpeaks too, with relation to the Impoſition of ſome Legal Rites, which once had a Divine Original and Uſe in the Church of God, and yet now could not conſiſt with obedience to the Truth. Gal. 5. 7. <hi>Ye did run well, who did hinder you, that you ſhould not obey the Truth?</hi> Hence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would not give place to St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, (when too much ſymbolizing with legal Ceremonies, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.) that ſo the Truth of the Goſpel might continue in the Churches of <hi>Galatia;</hi> plainly ſhewing, that as Light and Darkneſs cannot dwell together, ſo the Goſpel is excluſive of legal Ceremonies and humane Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And ſeeing all muſt grant, there has been a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the Truth of the Goſpel, both in Doctrine and Practice, there cannot be a better Method (I ſuppoſe) thought on, to amend what is amiſs in the Chriſtian World, <hi>(and thereby to reſtore true brotherly Fellowſhip)</hi> than that uſed by our Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 8. to reform a Corruption among the Jews, and ſuch an Error too as had a ſhew of Scripture-Authority for it, (I mean the Caſe of <hi>Divorce)</hi> yet our Saviour ſuppreſſeth that Cuſtom, by referring to the primitive Inſtitution of Marriage; <hi>From the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it was not ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon this Text, how well does our Brethren (I mean the Sober and Pious in the Church of <hi>England)</hi> defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popiſh Innovations, both in Opinion and Practice? One of them ſpeaks thus: As touching <hi>each of theſe Errors,</hi> we can ſay with our Saviour, in this preſent Correption of the Phariſees, that <hi>from the Beginning it was not ſo;</hi> and we care not whence they come, unleſs they come from the Beginning. This hath ever been (ſaith he) the Rule, the warrantable Rule to reform a Church. When <hi>Eſdras</hi> was intent on building the Temple, he ſent not to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> much leſs to <hi>Rome;</hi> he did not enquire into the Rituals of <hi>Numa Pompilius;</hi> but had recourſe for a <hi>Temple,</hi> to that of <hi>Solomon;</hi> and for a <hi>Rite,</hi> to that of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Indeed for Things meerly indifferent, (as he obſerves) there muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43526:11"/>
a Liberty in all Churches to conſult and do for the beſt. I dare not ſay as he, <hi>To make Conſtitutions;</hi> (for that's a great word) but to manage her Affairs with Decency, Order, and Charity.</p>
               <p>But to come more directly to our Doctrine, which is, <hi>Brotherly Fellowſhip; Love and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is carefully to be endeavoured and maintained by all Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certain it is that our Love, as Chriſtians, may go much further than our actual Communion in all things Chriſtian, may do; and yet this Love it ſelf is a kind of Fellowſhip. The Angels have Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with us, and acknowledg themſelves our <hi>Fellow Servants, Rev.</hi> 19. 10. and yet they do not partake with us in all our acts of Religion, but only by approbation and corroboration, in things which are well done. Now the beſt or moſt orderly ſort of Chriſtians cannot conceive a greater diſproportion between their Churches, and the Churches of the moſt erring (if but well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning) Societies that conſcientiouſly profeſs Love and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt: And even hence, we are obliged to hold as much Brotherly Fellowſhip with them, as we can, eſpecially that of Love and Brotherly Compaſſion. For when we conſider, that even ſome of all ſorts of Chriſtians will rather dye, than baſely deny their Lord and Maſter, we cannot but have Fellowſhip with ſuch in our Spirits, whilſt it is the ſame (and not a feigned Chriſt) to whom they ſhew their utmoſt teſtimony of Love.</p>
               <p>And this Conſideration alone, may ſuffice to take away that imbitteredneſs, which is too often found among Chriſtians diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one from another: Let their Appellations be what they will, ſo that they believe in the true Chriſt, and live well, being alſo faithful to what they know. And tho they be never ſo angry with me for oppoſing them in their Traditions, or erring Notions o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, yet I muſt have a Brotherly tenderneſs towards them all for the Truths ſake which dwelleth in them. But now, for ample or full Communion, I ſee not how that can be attained and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but where there is antecedent to it, an Union both in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice, in things neceſſary to the true Conſtitution and Government of the Church of Chriſt. And ſeeing alſo our Differences about theſe things are not ſmall, or trivial; it cannot (I think) be better ordered, than that a Friendly Diſtinction, and Brotherly Forbearance be permitted as to ample Communion; for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43526:12"/>
that Men cannot comfortably nor peaceably join together till they be agreed in theſe things.</p>
               <p>I ſee not that the difference betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> was ſo great (as to the thing about which they differed) as the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which Chriſtians differ in theſe days; and yet its certain their Contention being great (for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies <hi>provoking, gauling, and imbittered Speeches, and Minds,</hi> ſay the Learned) it is certain they could not tranſact their Affairs in the Goſpel together, but apart. And this was written perhaps to ſhew, that a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Unity in Judgment muſt precede our actual Communion, and till that be attained among us, there is a neceſſity (in regard, partly of human Frailty, and partly in regard of ſome precious Truths) to forbear one another, without deſtroying the Truth to which we have attained reſpectively.</p>
               <p>And this is the greateſt Love we can extend to one another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe difficult Circumſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To pity and heartily to pray one for another; for the Servant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive but be gentle towards all Men, in Meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There muſt be all Patience exerciſed, and Compaſſion ſhewed to the Ignorant, and thoſe that are out of the way, eſpecially where the ſcruple is tender and conſcientious. And in the mean time, the faithful Miniſter of God muſt <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound Words,</hi> he muſt teach the <hi>ſame Doctrine which was committed to his Truſt by the Apoſtles.</hi> He muſt <hi>warn others that they teach no other Doctrine.</hi> He muſt <hi>not give place to Jewiſh, or other Fables.</hi> And the Church muſt ſo walk in Chriſt, <hi>as they firſt received him,</hi> rooted in the Foundation-Principles, eſtabliſhed and built up in him: <hi>Not carried about with every Wind of Doctrine,</hi> but <hi>ſpeaking the Truth in Love, muſt endeavour to grow up into Chriſt in all things.</hi> In a word, it is the Duty of this Brotherhood to ſtick cloſe to the <hi>whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of God,</hi> and not to <hi>partake with other Mens Sins,</hi> or Errors in Life or Religion; which cannot be done, where contrarieties in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice about things neceſſary to the true State and Government of the Church of Chriſt, are allowed in the ſame Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip or Community.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love the Brotherhood.</hi> This Fraternity are in a ſpecial manner to love one another.</p>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:43526:12"/>
1. Becauſe God himſelf hath loved them with a ſpecial kind of Love: <hi>And if God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another,</hi> 1 John 3. It is happy when the Love of Chriſtians is founded upon this bottom, <hi>viz.</hi> the Manifeſtation of God's Love to them, and not upon any thing of human Excellency; for this is <hi>to have Mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Admiration,</hi> and not to admire this, <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe this is the ſweeteſt Manifeſtation, that we are the Children of God; for <hi>in this is manifeſt the Children of God,</hi> 1 John 3. 10. namely, that they love their Brethren: <hi>And every one that loveth, is born of God.</hi> And our Saviour makes it the true Character of Chriſtianity: <hi>By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another,</hi> Joh. 13. 35.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe this is the uniting Grace among Chriſtians, this makes their Society ſweet, their Fellowſhip deſirable, its a <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Love, Phil.</hi> 2. 1. This makes them like <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> they are bound in one Girdle, and their Love was wonderful.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe this makes the Sufferings of Chriſtians eaſy; when thoſe that ſuffer love them, in defence of whoſe Faith they do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and ſee themſelves beloved of their Brethren, even then when all Men ſeem to hate them. This made <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf rejoice in his Sufferings, Phil. 4. 10, 14. <hi>I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the laſt your care of me hath flouriſhed again,—Ye have well done that ye have communicated with me in my Affliction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us touch the things briefly, which may be ſure Evidences of this Brotherly Love.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If then we love the Brotherhood, we are much concern'd about them in our Thoughts. For what is the Object of a Man's Love, is the Subject of his Meditation. All true Lovers know this by Experience; and let the Love of the Brotherhood exceed our Love in other caſes. An inſtance of this Love we have in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. 2. 1, 2. <hi>For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them of Laodicea, and for as many as have not ſeen my Face in the Fleſh: That their Hearts might be comforted, being knit together in Love,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we love our Brethren, we bear them much upon our Heart in our Prayers; we cannot forget them if we rightly love them. <hi>Paul made mention of him in every Prayer of his whom he dearly loved,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 3. Let all Chriſtian Brethren do ſo too, for we cannot
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43526:13"/>
do leſs for any of them, or for many of them we can do no more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we love the Brotherhood, we will eſteem them highly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Vertues which we ſee in them, 2 <hi>John v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. And whom we love we will commend, and advance as much as we can, becauſe it's the native Property of Love to do ſo; as appears in the interchanges of Love in the Song of <hi>Solomon,</hi> between Chriſt and his Church: and is the way too, to encreaſe Love, as all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhews.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we love our Brethren, we will to our beſt defend their Reputation againſt thoſe that injure them. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> vindicated not himſelf only, but thoſe faithful Miniſters which were with him, when ſome reported of them that they <hi>walked after the Fleſh,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Let us do Evil that good may come;</hi> whoſe <hi>Damnation,</hi> for ſuch vile Reproaches againſt the Servants of Chriſt, <hi>he avers to be juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If we love the Brotherhood, we will to our Power relieve their Neceſſities. For <hi>He that hath this Worlds Good, and ſees his Brother want, and ſhutteth up the Bowels of his Compaſſion, how dwells the Love of God in him?</hi> And ſaith another Apoſtle, <hi>If a Brother or Siſter be deſtitute of daily Food, and ye ſay, Be ye filled, and give them not thoſe things that are neceſſary,</hi> what doth it profit? Wherefore let Love be without Diſſimulation. Let it be fervent. For to this end were <hi>our Souls purified in obeying the Truth through the Spirit,</hi> even <hi>unto unfeigned Love of the Brethren,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 22.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The laſt Evidence. If we love the Brotherhood, we will ſeek and preſerve as much as we can, the Peace of the whole, and the Proſperity of every part. <hi>Pray for the Peace of</hi> Jeruſalem (ſaith David) <hi>they ſhall proſper that love thee; for my Brethren and Companions ſake I will now ſay, Peace be within thy Walls, and Proſperity within thy Palaces.</hi> How greatly does the true Son of <hi>David,</hi> our Lord Jeſus, pray for this Bleſſing upon the whole Church, <hi>That they all may be one, as he and his Father are one?</hi> And what Chriſtian will not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think of doing any thing againſt the tenour of his bleſſed Prayer?</p>
               <p>I will conclude this point with a ſolemn Proteſtation againſt thoſe Evils which chiefly hinder the love of the Brotherhood; and the firſt is Pride.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:43526:13"/>
1. Only <hi>through Pride cometh Contention</hi> (ſaith the Spirit); when Men are admirers of themſelves, Proud, Boaſters; they ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, and Enemies to the Love of the Brotherhood. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> being got to this point, preſently makes havock of the Church, by caſting the Brethren out of the Church that ſhewed their brotherly Love to the travelling Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. And why? becauſe he loved to have the Preheminence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as he ſpared not to undervalue the Apoſtle himſelf. <hi>Aproud Profeſſor cannot love the Brotherhood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As all proud Men are Enemies to brotherly Love; ſo moſt of all ſuch as take themſelves to be infallible about things moſt diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, being vainly confident that God is oppoſed when their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are not obeyed. Theſe Men commonly drive furiouſly, rend and tear, if their Mandates meet with diſlike or non-reception. Theſe Men will ever ſtand ſtrenuouſly upon Niceties, and make things which are doubtful, and meerly indifferent, to become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe who make Gain their Godlineſs, are great Enemies to Brotherly Love, theſe are called <hi>greedy Dogs</hi> by the Prophet, <hi>greedy Wolves</hi> by the Apoſtle; theſe ſeek their own, not the things of Chriſt. They are Enemies to him; their God is their Belly, they mind earthly things; they change with every Wind for Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They are Lovers of their own ſelves. They teach things which they ought not, for filthy Lucres ſake. They love not the Brotherhood, but their Money.</p>
               <p>Thus much to the ſecond Point. We come now to the third part of our Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fear God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence the Doctrine has been propounded thus.</p>
               <p>Doct. III. <hi>Chriſtians muſt have an awful Fear of God before their Eyes, that in Matters of Religion they may ſerve him only, and not provoke him by ſinful Courſes, nor by the Fear of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To come rightly to the performance of this Duty, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to have a right knowledg or Belief of this God whom we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43526:14"/>
are to fear, for this our Saviour makes to be the <hi>weighty</hi> part of our Religion, <hi>Faith, and the Fear of God.</hi> Now in this Faith, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teceeds the Fear, Worſhip, and Service of God, we muſt conſider the Eſſence and Attributes of God. In the firſt, he is infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of our knowledg, or finding out unto Perfection. Job 4. 24. <hi>It is but a ſmall portion that we know (or can know) of him in this World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith therefore ſatisfies it ſelf, with knowing that <hi>God is:</hi> or, that <hi>there is one God.</hi> That he is a Spirit <note rend="inter">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 3.</note> Eternal, Pure, Omnipotent, Immutable, Inviſible, Merciful, Faithful, Holy, Juſt and Good; and that he is infinitely and perfectly ſo, and whatſoever elſe may be ſaid to repreſent him Great and Glorious; Great in his Sovereignty and Dominion, Glorious in his doings towards the Children of Men. In a Word, <hi>Faith</hi> apprehends or believes this God to be, whatſoever his Word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares him to be, which together with his works of Creation and Providence are the Intelligencers to Mortals, his good Spirit alſo helping and illuminating all that heartily ſeek after him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this Faith is not of the ſame magnitude in all that have it, but 'tis of the ſame Nature,<hi>—To all that have obtained like precious Faith with us, through the Righteouſneſs of God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To fear God,</hi> is indeed a Duty incumbent upon all Men, and not upon Chriſtians only. And for the better performance of this great Duty, it is good to know the Cauſe, why Mankind of all other Creatures is bound to fear God; I ſay, Mankind only, of all ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Creatures: for from other Creatures God expects not this, nor do they pay it to him, not having capacity, and ſo no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on them to do it. But they are ſubjugated to the Fear of Man, who is placed over them as Supream, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 7, 8. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I do not find that this Fear and Dread of Man, was upon the Creatures below him, till after the Earth was accurſed. It is true a Dominion was given Man over them in his innocent Eſtate, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28. But that he ſhould have ruled them with Rigour, as now, I find not, but do conceive that the terrour of Man to the brute Creatures, and their Diſobedience to him, are Effects of the Curſe; and its certain the Curſe was the Effect of Sin. But in theſe things let us not be too curious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:43526:14"/>
Now whether in caſe Man had not ſinned, he ſhould have been obliged to fear God as now, or whether he ſhould have properly feared God at all, may be enquired here? To which it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That ſeeing God had endued Man with excellent Reaſon and Judgment, and yet put him in a mutable State, and gave him notice that his ſtate was ſuch, when he gave him a Law with a Penalty upon the Breach of it. In the Breach of which <hi>he ſhould ſurely dye, Gen.</hi> 2. 17. It follows that Man was even then bound to Fear, and to ſtand in awe of his Majeſty from the beginning before Sin was upon him. So that Sin is not the Original Cauſe of the Fear of God, but his Bounty towards Man, and abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty over him, are the Grounds of it. And hence we may learn, how juſt, how neceſſary it is for us who are of the fall'n race of <hi>Adam,</hi> not only for that we are under theſe Original Obligations, and for that the Covenant which we are under as Chriſtians, tho a Covenant of Grace, yet is truly conditional (whatever ſome mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur to the contrary) to fear the God of Heaven, and to ſtand in awe of his Majeſty. <hi>Behold therefore the Goodneſs and Severity of God! on them that fell, Severity; but towards thee Goodneſs, if thou continue in his Goodneſs: otherwiſe thou alſo ſhall be cut off.</hi> Rom. 11. 22. Heb. 4. 1. But it is furthermore our Duty, for that we are more ſubject to err than <hi>Adam</hi> was, for all grant he had Free-will, and Sufficiency of Ability to ſtand had he uſed it. But tho ſome of us do hold we have a liberty of Will, yet we muſt all confeſs our Power to be very ſmall, without intervening Grace, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Temptations, or to do acts of Righteouſneſs. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>There is a Diſtinction of Fear towards God much ſpoken of, to wit, a ſervile Fear, and a filial Fear. The firſt they would exclude from a Chriſtian. But if by ſervile Fear be intended no more than to fear God, as a good Servant is to fear his Maſter, I can ſee no reaſon to exclude it: <hi>If I be a Maſter, where is my Fear? ſaith the Lord.</hi> Mal. 1. 16. It ſeems God's Servants muſt fear him. But perhaps the meaning of the diſtinction is this: <hi>By filial Fear is meant an holy Dread, leſt we do any thing that is evil, or leave undone the thing that is good; and by ſervile Fear, is meant a Fear of Puniſhment only.</hi> If this be it, I ſhall ſay little to it, believing, whoever makes this diſtinction, would have all Men, and ſpecially Chriſtians, to fear God ſo as to depart from all Evil, and to do
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43526:15"/>
Good, leſt Judgment be the Portion of their Cup from the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fear God;</hi> that is, ſtand in awe of his Majeſty, worſhip and ſerve him, and him only. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Only fear the Lord, and ſerve him with all your Heart.</hi> Pſal. 45. 11. <hi>He is thy Lord, and worſhip thou him. Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Mat. 4. 10. This is God's Right, we muſt only pay it to him. When <hi>Peter</hi> was put upon this Strait, whether to pleaſe or fear Men, when his Service to God was the matter in queſtion, his Speech was very frank and reſolute, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19. <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to hearken unto Men more than unto God, judg ye.</hi> This then muſt ever become good Chriſtians in matters of Religion, to ſtick cloſe to that which is right in the ſight of God, however it may be countermanded by Man. The Condeſcenſions of holy <hi>Paul</hi> were ſo wiſely attempered, as even then when he was made all things to all Men, and paying his debt of Love to the Wiſe and Unwiſe, ſo as to be without Law to them that were without Law, and under the Law to them that were under the Law; yet <hi>he was not without Law to God, but under the Law to Chriſt;</hi> he would not ſin to pleaſe any, nor <hi>do Evil that Good might come: For the Fear of the Lord is clean, the Beginning of Wiſdom,</hi> and that which muſt keep us company all our days; elſe we lie open to the fiery Darts of Satan, which will both hit and hurt, where the Fear of the Lord is abſent. <hi>Therefore bleſſed is the Man that feareth always.</hi> This is that Grace which held <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> back from Uncleanneſs, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> from Self-endedneſs in God's Service, when others made it burthenſom: <hi>This did not I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe of the Fear of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>I trembled in my ſelf, that I might reſt in the Day of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> ſaith the Prophet. <hi>I exceedingly fear and quake,</hi> ſaid <hi>Moſes. I am ſo troubled I cannot ſpeak,</hi> ſaid <hi>David.</hi> And ſhall we not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fear, and ſtand in awe of that Majeſty, which made theſe Pillars in the Church to tremble? Beware of a ſtupid and careleſs Spirit, for that will ſoon prove a revolting Spirit. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 22, 23. <hi>David</hi> makes that awful Fear of God an expreſs Duty to all; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 7. <hi>Thou, even thou art to be feared; and who may ſtand in thy preſence, when once thou art angry?</hi> Without a godly Fear no Service to God is acceptable. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.

Thus much in general. We ſhall now endeavour to deſcribe the Man that walks in the Fear of God, in a few Particulars. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that truly fears God, worſhips and ſerves him, <hi>muſt be delivered from the Fear of Man.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> is conſidering how to fear or ſerve God aright, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 45. he tells us, he will <hi>walk at Liberty;</hi> he will have his Heart free from that which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders due Obedience to God. And as to Matters of Religion, Chriſtians are <hi>Chriſt's Freemen.</hi> And therefore our Saviour (who was the moſt faithful to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that ever Man was) in this Caſe abſolutely prohibits the Fear of Man; <hi>Fear not him that can kill the Body.</hi> And it is certain, the <hi>Fear of Man brings a Snare,</hi> as appears in the Caſe of the Phariſees: They could not confeſs Chriſt, tho they believed in him, <hi>for they feared to be put out of their Synagogues; they loved the Praiſe of Men more than the Praiſe of God.</hi> He that thus fears Man, cannot fear God. Let us hear the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> he is plain; <hi>Do I now perſuade Men, or God?</hi> (that is, <hi>do I preach the Doctrine of God or Man?) if I yet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Men, I ſhould not be the Servant of Chriſt.</hi> We ſee here the Difference between a faithful Chriſtian and Miniſter of Chriſt, and thoſe that ſerve the Times: The latter always preach ſomething that is of Man, leſt they ſhould ſuffer Perſecution for the Croſs of Chriſt; the former fears neither Men nor Angels, ſo as to give conſent to another Goſpel, or any thing which perverts the Goſpel of Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4 to 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that truly fears God, <hi>will give to God the Things which are God's.</hi> This Rule, of all others, ſhould be obſerved by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, becauſe it proceeds from Chriſt himſelf, upon ſuch a ſpecial occaſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 21. as wherein the Right of Kings, and God's Right over Men are enquired into, and the Caſe determined by the Lord Chriſt, to the ſilencing his captious Adverſaries. <hi>Caeſar's</hi> Right muſt be given, and God's Right muſt not be with-held. Earthly Things, or our Obedience in Civil Caſes, is here ſtated upon <hi>Caeſar;</hi> there is therefore a neceſſity, that Obedience in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Caſes be due to God, or elſe he has nothing peculiar in or over us. Sith therefore God Almighty has reſerved all religious Obedience to himſelf, and that we muſt every Man <hi>give an Account of himſelf unto God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. Let all that fear God, give to him in religious Performances, the Things which have his Image and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43526:16"/>
Superſcription upon them, leſt he reject both the Offering, and the Offerer, with, <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi> Did not God provide by his expreſs Law, that his Sacrifices ſhould not be <hi>changed at Man's Will, a good for a bad, nor a bad for a good?</hi> Lev. 27. 10. Does not <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cry out againſt them that preſumed to <hi>change God's Ordinances, as Breakers of the everlaſting Covenant?</hi> Iſa. 24. 5. It fared very ill with <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> for offering <hi>that Fire which God commanded not.</hi> Levit. 10. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> were ſmote with Sickneſs and Death, for prophaning the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Table</hi> with their <hi>own Supper,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 22, 30. <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was afraid of God, when he altered the manner of carrying the Ark of God, 1 Chron. 13. And this Inſtance made him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>give to God the Things that were God's,</hi> namely, to ſerve him in due Order, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. Let the Uſe of all be, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke us to ſerve God <hi>with godly Fear,</hi> to ſtand in awe of his Word, to ſerve him with all poſſible exactneſs, according to the very Rules therein contained, that we may have the Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good and faithful Servants, as it was in the Caſe of <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 6. 22. <hi>Thus did</hi> Noah, <hi>according to all that God commanded him, ſo did he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He that truly fears God, will ever preſerve a good Conſcience towards God.</hi> But this can never be, where the inner Man is not pure, and the Heart delighted with the Service of God. Of ſome we read, that they profeſs high, but <hi>their Minds and Conſciences are defiled,</hi> Tit. 1. 16. Others that ſo walked before the Lord, as to gain this Reputation, that they <hi>did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect Heart.</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 25. 2. Now God is he that perfectly knows the Heart, and ſearches the Heart, and takes pleaſure in Uprightneſs; and he knows, and will make all Men know, that as the wilful Nectlect of Duties, I mean religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are an Evidence of an evil Conſcience; ſo the keeping back part, or ſerving God deceitfully, or ſerving God under a colour, without Conſcience of the Service, are the ſame, and ſhall, with the Perſons ſo worſhipping him, be rejected, as thoſe that do not fear God. <hi>For it ſhall come to paſs in the Day of the Lord</hi>'s <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that he will puniſh them that ſwear by the Lord, and that ſwear by</hi> Malcham; <hi>and them that are turned back from the Lord, and them that have not ſought the Lord, nor enquired after him.</hi> Zeph. 1. 5, 6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He that feareth God, will not reſiſt the Power of Princes; yet will he do what God commands, tho all the Princes in the World forbid</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:43526:16"/>
                  <hi>him; nor will he do what God forbids, tho all the Princes in the World ſhould command it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What our Chriſtian Obligations to Princes are, I hope to ſhew, in handling the next Direction in our Text. We are here only to ſhew, that no worldly Power can make void what God commands, nor make that lawful which God's Word forbids. The God of Heaven forbids worſhipping or bowing down to Images or Idols, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> commands the contrary, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 4, 5. under pain of ſuffering the fiery Furnace. Now this was a mighty Prince, to whom God had given a Kingdom, and great Glory; yet <hi>Shadrach</hi> and his Companions would not do his Command, but told him plainly, <hi>They would not ſerve his Gods, nor worſhip the Golden Image which he had ſet up. Dan.</hi> 3. 18. It has been the Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Earthly Gods, to countermand the Commands of the God of Heaven, without which there would have been but few Martyrs: But the greatneſs of their Multitude ſhews the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Truth, That God's Will muſt be obeyed, what Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſoever attend us from the Princes of this World for ſo doing. Indeed I find this Doctrine owned by moſt. For the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, upon <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19. ſay thus: <q>If any Magiſtrate command againſt God, that is to ſay, forbid Catholick Chriſtian Men to preach, or ſerve God, this ſame muſt be their Anſwer, (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Anſwer which <hi>Peter</hi> gave, &amp;c.) tho they be whipped or killed for their Labour.</q> And Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> allows the Note, but yet would not have the Papiſts to have any benefit by it, (ſo partial are Men, when uppermoſt.) We ſee then, by conſent of Chriſtians generally, the Voice of God muſt be obeyed in Things religious, tho the Princes of the Earth ſay Nay. And to this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the holy Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 23. <hi>Princes ſate and ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me;</hi> that is, they ſat on the Throne, and dereed Things againſt him: <hi>But thy Servant did meditate in thy Statutes.</hi> He would not depart from the Ways of God, tho he was perſecuted. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 161. <hi>Princes perfecuted me without a cauſe, but my Heart ſtandeth in awe of thy Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here it may be fit to obviate an Objection.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid, <hi>Tho it is true, that all that fear God, are bound thus to obey God, and not Man, in Matters of Religion, and to ſuffer patiently, rather than to ſin; yet whether in Things indifferent, which</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:43526:17"/>
                  <hi>are neither commanded nor forbidden; if Princes here make ufe of their Authority, Chriſtians are not bound to obey actively? As for Example, about the Place of Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this it may be anſwered; Seeing God has forbidden no Place, if that were all the Buſineſs, he were a mad Man that would not actually obey; and conſequently he is bound to obey Authority in every Caſe that is like it; as thus: It is a Duty for a Nation, in a time of common Calamity, to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Faſting and Prayer; and doubtleſs 'tis beſt this be done at the ſame time, and none ſo fit to order this as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: If therefore Authority command the tenth, twentieth, or thirtieth Day of ſuch a Month, for ſuch a Service, I doubt not but he ſhould be guilty of Sin, that ſhould in this refuſe ſuch Time, meerly becauſe it is appointed by the Magiſtrate's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And if there be an hundred Caſes of this kind, the ſame Anſwer muſt be given in them all, for ought I ſee; or elſe under pretence of fearing God, we ſhall diſhonour the King, which is a Sin of an high Nature.</p>
               <p>Tho Chriſtians be Subjects to Princes, yet Princes are Subjects to God, and in the Sphere where God has ſet them, can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more pleaſing to him, than to promote the Intereſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by diſcountenancing Prophaneneſs and Irreligion, and by giving Encouragement to the Lovers of it. But then as they are Subjects to Chriſt, they are Fellow-Servants with their Subjects, (yea, the Angels think not themſelves too high to be called ſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10.) and therefore muſt with their Subjects be obedient to <hi>one Lawgiver,</hi> even Jeſus, and not aſſume Power to make Laws for the Conſciences of Men in Religion, nor to force them to go beyond their Knowledg and Faith in Things of that kind, <hi>ſeeing what is not of Faith is Sin, and we muſt every one give an Account of himſelf unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt Particular I ſhall inſiſt upon, as neceſſary to the true Fear of God, is to avoid Covetouſneſs and Worldly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Covetouſneſs is ſaid to be Idolatry. And he that is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Perſon, makes little further uſe of Religion, than to be a Cloak for his Iniquity; he fears not God, he ſerves not the Lord Chriſt, but his own Belly; for this he preaches, for this he prays, and without this he will do neither. Theſe are the Men that make Merchandize of the Word of God, <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>that Gain is Godlineſs.</hi> I meet with a notable Paſſage in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43526:17"/>
our Engliſh Chronicles; in the ſixth Century, 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Clergy of</hi> Britain <hi>ſet all their Mind to ſerve God, and not the World, the Heart, and not the Belly: Wherefore then were they had in great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Honour. But as they encreaſed in earthly Treaſure, ſo they decreaſed in heavenly Treaſure.</hi> Fab. Chron. 5 part. cap. 134. Let all that fear God, beware of this evil Diſeaſe, eſpecially ſuch as are Miniſters of Chriſt. <hi>No Man can ſerve two Maſters; ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Fear of God; let us now conſider the Debt which we owe to our King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Honour the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho by the Order of our Text, we are to ſpeak of this weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Subject in the laſt place, yet it is not the leaſt part of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For as the ancient Chriſtians were wont to ſpeak, ſo it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains an eternal Truth, <hi>That as God is above the Emperor, ſo none other is above the Emperor but God.</hi> And conſequently our Duty, next to Almighty God, is to our Prince; as we ſee here in our Text, the Honour of the King is provided for, next to the Fear of God. We have already ſhewed, in the opening of the Words, that the King here meant, or immediately ſpoken of, was an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then King, and a great Idolater in his Religion; and yet the Holy-Ghoſt does here oblige all Chriſtians, even of the higheſt Rank, to honour ſuch Kings, <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, and conſequently all his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors not excepted; for indeed he had learned this Obedience of one higher than himſelf, even Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore muſt needs recommend the ſame to all Chriſtians. And hence the Doctrine is,</p>
               <p>Doct. IV. <hi>All Chriſtians are bound by Goſpel-Rules to be good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to Princes, to honour their Perſons, and conſcienciouſly to obey. their Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To evince this great Truth, it may be needful to ſhew, <hi>That Kingly Power or Government is of God.</hi> Not in the Sence (prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objected by ſome Writers) wherein Plagues, Diſeaſes, and Puniſhments are of God; for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict ſuch an ungodly Expoſition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1, &amp;c. wherein he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43526:18"/>
avers, even of the ſame Kingly Power ſpoken of by <hi>Peter, That it was ordained of God;</hi> that the Magiſtrate was <hi>God's Miniſter</hi> to the Chriſtian Man, (as well as any other) <hi>for Good, to execute Wrath upon him that does Evil.</hi> Which Word, <hi>Miniſter,</hi> refers evidently to him that bears the Sword of Juſtice, and not to the Power only, which yet he affirms to be of God, and confirms it by this Argument, <hi>For there is no Power but of God; the Powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> And this is the only comfortable Ground of Obedience to the higher Powers, to be well ſatisfied in this, that whether it fall out our Obedience ſhall be active or paſſive, yet therein we conform our ſelves to the Will of God, or to his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; <hi>And he that ſhall reſiſt the Power, does reſiſt the Ordinance of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That Kingly Government is of God as clearly, if not more clearly than any other Form of Government, is very plain from the Text it ſelf, conſidered with the Context, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's ſake, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to the King as ſupreme, or unto Governours, as unto them that are ſent by him,</hi> &amp;c. Where Supremacy over all Perſons in Things Civil, is ſo clearly given to the King by God himſelf, even over Governours, as well as the People governed, that it muſt in no wiſe be denied.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it be objected, that tho the Power Magiſtratical be of God, yet the Form or Mode of it is of Man, becauſe (according to the Greek) 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. may be read thus, <hi>Submit your ſelves to every humane Creature.</hi> To this I ſay; The Words, <hi>Humane Creature,</hi> are better underſtood of the Laws made by Humane Authority, than of the Magiſtrates themſelves: For as the moſt high God, and he only, can give Being and Power to a Divine Law, inſomuch that no Power on Earth can create ſuch a Law; ſo Earthly Gods, and none but they, can create and give Power to an humane Law; and Laws thus made, are rightly called <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Creatures,</hi> or Ordinances of Men, (as our Engliſh expreſſes it.) And when Laws are thus made, tho they ſhould happen to be ill Laws, (as it ſometimes happens to be ſo) yet they muſt be obeyed, (either actively or paſſively) becauſe the Power Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratical muſt not be reſiſted; only the Error of an ill Law muſt be refuſed by all faithful Men, eſpecially in Matters of Religion, as we have ſhewed before.</p>

4. This great Power which God hath given to Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Earth, to make Laws, is (as I conceive) the chief cauſe why they are called Gods, Pſal. 82. 6. <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods, and all of you are Children of the moſt High:</hi> That is, becauſe of that reſemblance which they have to God himſelf, being decked with Power and Majeſty, to make and execute Laws (in this lower World) which concern the Children of Men as ſuch.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And as to the Form of Kingly Government (for this is all that I can find in my Text): Let us hear what God himſelf ſaith. <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice; by me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</hi> What can be ſaid more in this caſe? If any ſhall ſay, 'tis not God, but Wiſdom that ſpeaks theſe Words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15, 16. I anſwer, it is Folly that makes the Objection, for this Wiſdom is the Voice of God, becauſe it is the Wiſdom of God. Kings are called <hi>the Lords Anointed.</hi> And not only the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but even Heathen Kings alſo. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord to his Anointed, even to Cirus.</hi> Now <hi>Cirus</hi> was King of <hi>Perſia, Ezra.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If yet it be ſaid, that Government, but not the Form of Government, is of God, but of human Choice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, I ſpeak not of a Government to be formed, and not yet in being; but of one eſtabliſhed: and therefore, I ſay, the diſtinction is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. But how ſhall it be a Power or Government without its Form? Does God make an Ordinance or any thing elſe without Form? If ſo, what can you call it? It is the Form that gives eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to be, or at leaſt to be called what it is. It's bad ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſay, that God makes an Ordinance, and leaves Man to form it, as to the Eſſentials of it. And ſeeing no Nation can long endure, without Government, nor that Government ſubſiſt without Form. It ſeems neceſſary that both be acknowledged to be of God; and conſequently, where the Form of Government is Regal or Kingly, it is of God, and as ſuch to be had in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>That God does by his Providence order and permit Men to tranſact, order, and ſettle the Mode of Government, in Nations which yet are unſetled in that reſpect, does not prove that the Form or Settlement when made is not of God, or not to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo; becauſe in ſuch an emergency, the Voice of the People, together with God's Providence, muſt herein be acknowledged the Voice of God. For thus in an ordinary way is that Saying true,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43526:19"/>
                  <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice. By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</hi> It was the moſt high God which gave <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> a Kingdom, Majeſty, Glory and Honour, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 18. who then may queſtion his Regal Power to be of God? It's ill murmuring, worſe diſputing, worſt of all to fight againſt God. Surely, if <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> muſt have this Honour given to him as King, even by <hi>Daniel</hi> that Servant of God, becauſe by the Almighty he was thus exalted, altho otherwiſe he was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man, a great Idolater; it muſt needs reſolve all doubts that may ariſe, about the warrantableneſs of Kingly Government, and all Chriſtians Obedience to it, with reſpect to all Kings under whom they live, whatſoever.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that ſome may uſurp Kingly Government, and ſome that have it may abuſe it.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; Tho this be true, yet it is nothing to the purpoſe; for this is incident to all other Forms of Government. And when God permits ſuch things, it's uſually for the Sins of the People, as it is written, <hi>For the Tranſgreſſions of a Land, many are the Princes thereof,</hi> Prov. 28. 2. <hi>He gave them a King in his Wrath:</hi> But this was becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> had rejected God, and his Prophet <hi>Samuel.</hi> Otherwiſe God had promiſed to give his People a King, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 21. Yea, the Government of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf was after a ſort a Regal or Kingly Government, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 4, 5. If then it ſo fall out, that Kings or other Rulers do oppreſs their Subjects, I know no remedy for the Subject but Prayers and Tears, that God would turn their own Hearts more to his Fear, and the Heart of their Prince to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; <hi>(For the Hearts of Kings are in his Hands:)</hi> And with patient Suffering, and humble Supplication, to ſeek for Favour. For Rebellion muſt by no means be admitted, <hi>For it is as the Sin of Witchcraft;</hi> being againſt God, as well as againſt the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is againſt the Ordinance of God. And hence <hi>Tertullian</hi> well ſaid, <hi>The Chriſtian knows that the Emperor is conſtituted of God.</hi> And ſaith the Prophet, <hi>I have delivered all theſe Countries into the Hands of Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> Who then may take them out of his Hand? Sure none but God, who ſets up one, and puts down ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as pleaſes him. For he that gives can only rightfully take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and he doth ſo when Men abuſe what he gives. <hi>Mene, Mene, Takel <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pharſin, God hath numbred thy Kingdom, and finiſhed it,—and given it to the Medes and Perſians,</hi> Dan. 5. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:43526:19"/>
If it be objected from that Paſſage, <hi>They have ſet up Kings, and not by me;</hi> that Kingly Government is of Man, not of God.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; This rather proves the contrary, for here a diſorder only is reproved in the way of doing that, which they could not do rightly but by him, that is, God. They ſo ſet up a King, as <hi>they rejected God, that he ſhould not reign over them,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 7. Hence it was that <hi>Samuel</hi> gave them that Reproof and Exhortation, 1 Sam. 12. 20. <hi>Ye have done all this Wickedneſs, yet turn not aſide from following the Lord, but ſerve the Lord with all your Heart.</hi> But God did not deny them a King: No, but he had given them direction how to chuſe them a King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 14, 15, 16. And moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that of all Civil Governments which God hath ſet up in the World, Kingly Government is the moſt frequent, and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, ſo far as the Scripture gives any account of this Matter: And indeed it holds the neareſt reſemblance to that Government which God himſelf exerciſes over the World in general; For he is King of Kings, and his Kingdom ruleth over all.</p>
               <p>Let us then come more directly to the Text, <hi>Honour the King.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the Honour which we owe to his Royal Perſon. <hi>We muſt eſteem it very highly,</hi> and behave our-ſelves towards him with that Fear and Reverence which belongs to him, as placed next unto God. <hi>My Son, fear thou the Lord and the King,</hi> Prov. 24. 21. <hi>Give unto Caeſar the things which are Caeſar</hi>'s, <hi>and to God the things which are God's.</hi> So the Text, <hi>Fear God, Honour the King.</hi> We ſee the King holdeth the next place of Honour unto God. Hence <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> perſonating the Chriſtians of his time, ſays, <hi>We honour the Emperour as a Man next unto God.</hi> And ſaith <hi>Optatus, Above the Emperour there is none but God, who made the Emperour.</hi> If we will honour the King's Perſon, or eſteem him highly, we muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon all ſit occaſions, give him (with Reverence) his Place and Titles of Honour; but alſo defend his Perſon with the hazard of our own, as thoſe did who would not ſuffer King <hi>David</hi> to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard himſelf, ſaying, <hi>Thou art worth ten thouſand of us.</hi> Let us hate to think or ſpeak evil or contemptuouſly of him whom God hath exalted, and ſet over us.</p>

We find a remarkable Inſtance of true Love and Loyalty to a Prince, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 19, 20, 21. Here tho <hi>Ittai</hi> was willed by the King, not to put himſelf in danger for him, yet he anſwers thus, <hi>As the Lord liveth, and as my Lord the King liveth, ſurely in what place my Lord the King ſhall be, whether in Death, or in Life, even there alſo will thy Servant be.</hi> This poor exiled Stranger (for ſuch he was) ſhall riſe up in Judgment againſt many native Subjects, who have done quite contrary hereunto even in our days.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt Honour him in Love.</hi> Sincere Love, and Loyal Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as he is King, can in no wiſe be wanting in a good Subject: Nor can we honour the King heartily, if we do not love him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely. Now he that truly loves his Prince, has him much in his ſerious Thoughts, eſpecially when he prays to the God of Heaven: He will not then forget him whom he truly Loves, whom he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in Love. If he love him, he will pray for him; perhaps that is all the good he can do his Prince; and in this a mean Subject may ſerve his King, as much as any, ſo that his Prayer be Serious and Godly. It is highly obſervable, how the duty of making Prayer for all Men, and particularly for Kings and Rulers, with Supplication, Interceſſion, and giving of Thanks, is required of Chriſtians; eſpecially of thoſe in the Miniſtry: That by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters conſtant and devout performance of this Duty in behalf of all that are in Authority, the Hearts of the People may be more endeared towards their Prince, and themſelves hereby inſtructed to perform their Duty, and manifeſt their Love to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in like manner, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. And to enforce the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to this Duty, the Apoſtle tells us, that it is good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next Demonſtration of honouring the King, ſhall be taken from the manner of our Language, and the matter of our Diſcourſe when concerned to ſpeak of him, or of his Doings. In theſe we muſt hate the thoughts of Scurrility, or reflecting Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; for the Tongue is the Index of the Mind, and we are expreſly forbidden to curſe or ſpeak evil of the King, even in our Bed-Chamber; for theſe things are ſo odious, that Providence will fight againſt ſuch as do ſo, and the Iniquity of ſuch doings will return upon the Offenders: <hi>For a Bird in the Air ſhall carry the News, and that which hath Wings ſhall tell the Tidings,</hi> Eccleſ. 10. 20. Are they not marked out in Scripture for the worſt ſort of Men, that <hi>are not afraid to ſpeak evil of Dignities?</hi> More daring
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43526:20"/>
and preſumptuous than Angels, who are great in Authority, and may lawfully do more than Men, yet they dare not bring a railing Accuſation againſt the Devil, who is the Prince of Darkneſs; but they refer the wrong done to them unto God, who both can and will rebuke him. But why may not the good Angels rebuke Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan? Why they know (as wicked as he is) he could do nothing about the Body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor any thing elſe, without Licenſe from the Almighty: He muſt indeed be withſtood in his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but he muſt not be rail'd on it ſeems. And then what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Men are they that will take Liberty to rail on their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if they do not what they would have them? Nay, tho they ſhould do Evil, yet muſt they in no wiſe be evil ſpoken of. <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the Gods, nor ſpeak evil of the Ruler of my People,</hi> Exod. 22. 28. Acts 23. 5.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But have not the Prophets reproved Kings when they did Evil?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, Yea; God reproved them by his Prophets frequently. And no doubt that Men of God, ſuch as have Commiſſion from him, may and ought to deal faithfully with Kings and Rulers, when they do that which is Evil in the ſight of the Lord. But this is that which is intolerable, that the Errors or Infirmities of Princes ſhould be made the Subject of Mens Diſcourſe: Surely they are rather to be lamented before the Lord in ſecret. <hi>Is it meet to ſay to a King, Thou art wicked? and to Princes, Ye are ungodly?</hi> Job 34. 18. The true Sence of theſe Interrogatives is, No. It is by no means thus to reflect upon a King. St. <hi>Paul</hi> having ſpoken raſhly, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 5. corrects and excuſes himſelf, by ſaying, <hi>I wiſt not, Brethren, that he was God's High Prieſt: For it is written, Thou ſhalt not ſpeak Evil of the Ruler of my People.</hi> Let Chriſtians beware of this evil Diſeaſe which reigns in theſe days. Let them remember, <hi>They are bound by Goſpel-Rules to Honour the King,</hi> next to God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Honour which we owe to the King's Perſon.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider, how we are obliged by Goſpel-Rules to obey his Authority. And here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let the Subject conſider how much God has ſet him below his Prince, for Obedience ſeldom iſſues from a lofty Mind. It's not impoſſible for a Subject, in conceit, to be a Prince's Mate, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43526:21"/>
then Subjection is Death to him. That Paſſage concerning <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth,</hi> the Son of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 8. was written for our Learning. When he conſidered the Majeſty of King <hi>David,</hi> and his own Condition as a Subject; <hi>What is thy Servant</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thou ſhouldſt look upon ſuch a dead Dog as I am?</hi> Such ſelf-aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Thoughts in a Subject (eſpecially thoſe of low degree) does argue an Heart full of deſires to honour him whom God has exalted as his King, and a Mind willing to obey him. Let Chriſtians learn by this Example.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Saviour hath led us the right way: <hi>Give unto Caeſar the things which are Caeſar's.</hi> But what things are they? Why the Things which bear his <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Superſcription. Whoſe Image and Superſcription is this,</hi> ſays Chriſt? They ſay, <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Give unto Caeſar, &amp;c.</hi> We may hence fairly infer, that whatſoever bears the King's Authority, or is required in his name, muſt be obeyed. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's ſake, whether it be to the King as Supream, or unto Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as unto thoſe that are ſent by him.</hi> Mark, if they be ſent by him, they bear his Image, or Superſcription, they repreſent the King; ſubmit, ſubmit, either Actively or Paſſively, here's no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, for here comes <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Only here it muſt be minded, <hi>Caeſar's</hi> Superſcription is only to be put to the Ordinances of Man. None can put a Divine Character upon a Law but God; and we muſt give to God the things which are God's, Divine Obedience, or Obedience in all divine things, to God; Civil Obedience, or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in all civil things, to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Thus has our Saviour divided the matter of Chriſtians (and all Mens) Obedience to God, and to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Let us hold to this moſt juſt Settlement, a better cannot poſſibly be given.</p>
               <p n="3">3. St. <hi>Paul</hi> will have Chriſtians Subjection to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to proceed from them of pure Conſcience, or for <hi>Conſcience ſake,</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>not only Wrath.</hi> And of this Reaſon wills that we give all the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that we can to Princes, that we are heartily their Subjects; And willingly obedient in all things which concerns their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over us. This Principle of Obedience in the Heart, will make our Obedience to Princes delightful and durable; they that have this good Principle in them, will never be weary of any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Labour, Service, or Hazard for their King: where it is wanting, the King can put no confidence in them. This is ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, ſo neceſſary, that he that hath not ſuch an Heart for his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43526:21"/>
Sovereign, is unworthy the name of a Subject: He is no Subject. From this Principle, we are to pay tribute alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 6, 7. and not grudgingly. And when Princes ſee Men ready, in conſcience of their Duty, to ſerve them as God's Vicegerents; how naturally will this draw back again the influence of all Princely Favours? That Prince who is thus happy in the Obedience of his Subjects, will doubtleſs, as a Loving Father, contrive the beſt to make his Subjects happy under his Government.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How clearly is our Duty to our Superiors delivered by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Tit. 3. 1, <hi>&amp;c. Put them in mind to be ſubject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magiſtrates, to be ready to every good work.</hi> Let the Power be in this or the other Form (for all Nations have not the ſame Form of Government) you muſt not diſpute that, you muſt chearfully obey, as becomes Men of a ready Mind, to do the good commanded by Magiſtrates; you muſt not ask whether they be Heathen Kings, or Chriſtian Kings: You muſt obey all Kings or Magiſtrates, <hi>For they are God's Miniſters, attending on this very thing;</hi> i. e. the Government of the World: a very neceſſary thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which human Society cannot ſubſiſt. Here is no Limitation of time for your Subjection to Princes, Powers, and Magiſtrates; you are under this Obligation ſo long as St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> is Canonical. Let not then any idle Dream of the change of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations ſubvert you from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel-Rules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in this great Caſe, in which the Happineſs of Chriſtian Men, as ſuch, is much concerned: <hi>For, who ſhall harm them if they be careful Followers of that which is good?</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 13. But if it ſo fall out, that notwithſtanding your care in this matter, ye <hi>muſt ſuffer for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſake, then happy are ye,</hi> &amp;c. for ſtill religious Obedience is due to God, and muſt be paid to him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This place, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. commands Chriſtians <hi>to be ready to every good work. Obj.</hi> What if the Powers <hi>command otherwiſe? what then?</hi> For anſwer to this, we know we have an Obligation to obey God antecedent to that of our Obedience to Kings (as has been ſhewed.) He commands us to abſtain from every appearance of Evil, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 22. Wherefore if the Power ſhall be ſo unhappy to command otherwiſe, as it fell out in the caſe of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Dan.</hi> 5. there the Penalty muſt be patiently endured. And then the Powers are ſtill obeyed. And tho ſome vainly upbraid us, that there either is no ſuch thing as Paſſive Obedience; or that our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in this is like the Obedience of a Felon, when he goes to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43526:22"/>
the Gallows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such blind <hi>Byards</hi> may be pleaſed to know, the Felon hath ordinarily nothing to chuſe, but muſt neceſſarily dye: whereas the ſuffering Chriſtian has Life and Liberty offered if he will but worſhip ſo, or ſo. Now here he chuſes rather to ſuffer, than to do that which he conceives (at leaſt) to be ſin in the ſight of God, that ſo he may be a faithful Witneſs for God; and therein a Bleſſing to his Prince and to his Nation, which is his only way to ſilence the Ignorance of fooliſh Men; whoſe unwary Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections reflect not only upon all true Martyrs ſince the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, but upon Chriſt himſelf, who for this cauſe was hated and perſecuted, becauſe <hi>He bore witneſs to the Truth,</hi> Joh. 18. 37. and that the <hi>Works of the World were Evil,</hi> John 7. 7.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>But if it ſhould happen that Princes ſhould ſome way intrench upon the Civil Rights of their Subjects? What then muſt we do?</hi> What then? Why it is dangerous to contend with them in ſuch caſes; we are taught otherwiſe by the Example of our Saviour, in his direction to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the caſe of paying Tribute to the Roman Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 25, 26, 27. For it is evident from this place, that our Saviour was not obliged by Law to pay Cuſtom or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, but was free in that caſe; yet it being demanded, he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Peter</hi> to pay it, both for himſelf, and his Maſter: So careful was he to avoid Offences, that he will pay Tribute, and adviſes his Followers to do it too, tho it be in their own wrong. A good precedent to all Chriſtians to be humble, and not to contend with Authority in or about indifferent things: Would God they would conſider it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But it may here be demanded, Whether Princes may not warrantably puniſh ſuch as ſubmit not to the Religion by them eſtabliſhed, from the Example of King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> Ezra. 7. 26. <hi>Whoſoever will not do the Law of thy God, and the Law of the King, let Judgment be executed ſpeedily upon him, whether it be unto Death, or to Baniſhment, or to Confiſcation of Goods, or to Impriſonment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſs, this Objection requires a ſerious Anſwer. And with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments, I ſhall ſay a few Things in Anſwer to it. And it ſeems by the Scope and Contexture of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given to <hi>Ezra</hi> by <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> that theſe Things are evident:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the King did not himſelf embrace the Religion of the Jewiſh Nation, but retained ſtill his former Religion; for tho he did fear the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet he never calls him his God, but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43526:22"/>
the God of Heaven, and the God of <hi>Ezra,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God had by a ſpecial Providence, and Motion from himſelf, diſpoſed the Heart of the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to give free Liberty to the Jews, which were Captives in his Dominions, to go forth to ſerve their God; verſ. 13. <hi>I make a Decree, that all they of the People of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and of his Prieſts and Levites in my Realm, which are minded of their own free Will to go up to Jeruſalem, to go with thee,—to do whatſoever ſhall ſeem good to them, after the Will of your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The King does not only give a preſent Supply to <hi>Ezra,</hi> as a <hi>Free-Will-Offering</hi> to the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> verſ. 15. but alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for his neceſſary Supply for the future, <hi>out of the King's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,</hi> verſ. 20.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The King fearing the Diſpleaſure of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf and his Sons, does require <hi>Ezra,</hi> that <hi>whatſoever was required by the God of Heaven ſhould be diligently done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The King alſo empowers <hi>Ezra</hi> to ſet Magiſtrates and Judges over the People, and in ſo doing, gave <hi>Ezra</hi> a Magiſtratical Power, or made him a Magiſtrate; and ſo gives Order, that whoſoever would not be obedient to him ſhould be puniſhed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, 26. This is the Sum of the Commiſſion given to <hi>Ezra</hi> by the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all which, nothing appears, that any of his Subjects ſhould be compelled to alter their Religion, nor be forced to be all of one Religion: But a free Liberty is given to the Jews, (as well as to others) to ſerve their God according to his Law, and a Reſtraint laid upon them that would hinder them. And <hi>Ezra</hi> is empowered (indeed) to puniſh thoſe that were under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Law, if they would not do it; and ſuch as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his Authority, as a Magiſtrate, which he received from the King, were to be puniſhed by the Law of the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who had the Power of Life and Death in his hand, which the Jewiſh Nation had not at this time.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We may learn hence, that it is indeed a bleſſed Thing for all Kings to fear the God of Heaven, and to advance the Intereſt of Religion in their Dominions; and it is as evident, that Religion muſt always be ſetled according to the Law of God, with the greateſt Care that may be, and none puniſhed for keeping the Law of God; but for breaking the Law of God, and the Law of the King, which did concur with the Law of God. Here were great
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43526:23"/>

               <p n="7">7.

               </p>
               <p>Now let us write (or deſire the Lord to write) the Words of our Text in our Hearts; <hi>Honour all Men; Love the Brotherhood; Fear God; Honour the King.</hi> Surely that Chriſtian, that ſhall make it his Buſineſs to do theſe things heartily, <hi>ſhall be acceptable to God, and approved of Men;</hi> there ſhall be <hi>no occaſion of ſtumbling in him.</hi> But if Chriſtians be too buſy to inſpect Matters of State, or to meddle with thoſe that contrive or project any thing to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance and ſubverſion of the Government in the Kingdoms where they live, they ſhall never be able to recommend their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (be it never ſo good in it ſelf) to the acceptance of their Governors, nor to obtain from them to be <hi>Nurſing-Fathers</hi> to it; but ſhall certainly expoſe themſelves to the Diſpleaſure of God, as well as to the Wrath of Princes. And God himſelf will vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Honour of his Ordinance of Worldly Government, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that deſpiſe it, as well as againſt all that abuſe their Power in it; <hi>for there is no Reſpect of Perſons with God.</hi> Rom. 2. 11.</p>

Let me therefore exhort you, my Brethren, (as you know it has been my manner theſe thirty Years) <hi>to follow Peace with all Men, and Holineſs;</hi> to ſtudy to be quiet, and eſpecially in trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Times; <hi>to fear the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change,</hi> Prov. 24. 21. Many have undone themſelves by itching after Changes in Worldly Government. God only knows what is beſt for you, and for the Nation. They that are weary of this, are ſoon weary of that; few know what they would have; and who is able to deviſe any thing that will pleaſe all Humors, and ſuit all Intereſts? Bleſs God for your Prince, and for the Peace you have enjoyed under him, and pray for him, and for all that are in Authority, that under them (if the Will of God be ſo) you may lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs and Honeſty. They that will not pray for all that are in Authority, do not fear God, for they contemn his Word, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. They do not love, and ſo they cannot honour the King.</p>
               <p>You are at preſent under Sufferings, for the conſciencious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of what you believe to be your Duty towards God in Matters of Religion; humble your ſelves under the mighty Hand of God, and ſuffer patiently what Trials it ſhall pleaſe God to exerciſe you under, that (as our Apoſtle hath it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7.) <hi>the Trial of your Faith being much more precious than that of Gold that periſheth, tho it be tried with Fire, might be found unto Praiſe, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Glory, at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I ſay no more; the Lord direct you. <hi>AMEN.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O prevent a Miſtake, and to remove an Aſperſion too frequently caſt upon us, be pleaſed to know, that tho we differ from you and others, in ſome things relating to the Conſtitution and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a true Church, yet we do not therefore arrogate to our ſelves alone the Chriſtian Name, nor exalt our ſelves in our Imaginations above others; but do believe and hope, that the Number of the ſaved Ones will be gathered out of all ſorts of Chriſtians, who heartily love God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and live holily and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly among Men, tho they be diverſified in reſpect of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, by reaſon of the Place and Government where they live:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43526:26"/>
Yea, we have Charity for all Men, who are faithful to the Means of Grace afforded them, how ſmall ſoever, knowing that our God delights in Mercy, and does not exact the utmoſt Farthing of any Man.</p>
               <p>But for all this, as it is certain there hath been abundance of Errors introduced among Chriſtians, ſo it has pleaſed God to raiſe up a People ſtill to teſtify againſt them, <hi>(the Memories of whom are bleſſed, tho they were frequently perſecuted.)</hi> So we believe it a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incumbent upon us, to bear our Teſtimony to what Truth we know, and not to partake with any in their By-Paths in Life or Religion, and yet endeavour as much as in us lieth, after Unity and Concord with all that fear God, and own the Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>To which purpoſe we have humbly propoſed what we thought concern'd us, in order to a better Underſtanding and Compliance, in our <hi>Friendly Epiſtle to the Biſhops and Miniſters of the Church of England,</hi> publiſhed ſome Years ago, but has not been publickly taken notice of, till lately one Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> a Perſon of Worth for his Integrity, and Zeal for the Proteſtant Intereſt, and for his gentle Diſpoſition towards ſuch as fear God, tho differing from him in the Caſe of Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>It hath pleaſed him (I ſay) to take notice of our ſaid Epiſtle, and to <hi>offer ſomething in order to a Compoſure of Differences,</hi> which I confeſs, with him, to be a thing greatly to be deſired. But then he is pleaſed to ſhew us nothing of Mitigation, or Hopes of the removal of the Things which hath occaſioned our Diſunion, but does rather wholly charge the Cauſe of Diviſion upon us, and ſuppoſes our <hi>Difference about Baptiſm, to be the chief Cauſe of our diſſenting from the Church of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>But tho this is indeed a matter of great Importance, becauſe true Baptiſm is antecedent to Church-Communion; yet that which is greater in our Judgment, is that open Prophaneneſs, which, God knows, reigns and rages in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therewithal, the utter Neglect of Diſcipline to reform thoſe Iniquities; and alſo that perſecuting Spirit, which appears even in too many of the Guides of the Church, by whoſe Cruelty our Sufferings have been much augmented.</p>
               <p>For theſe Cauſes we have thought our ſelves concerned to make this our Chriſtian Apology, in which we crave leave to uſe that Freedom of Speech which the Matters depending do require. And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43526:26"/>
yet, ſeeing we muſt acknowledg that we are not infallible, (as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does the Church of <hi>England</hi> pretend ſo to be) we ſhall ſpeak under Correction, and by the help of God, with reſolution to ſubmit to a clear Conviction, if indeed it ſhall appear, that the Things wherein we diſſent are juſtifiable on the part of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but till this be done, it would be Hypocriſy and Baſeneſs in us, to violate our Conſciences in Things pertaining to Religion, to obtain Favour from Men; <hi>for if we ſhould ſo pleaſe Men, we ſhould not be the Servants of Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 1. 10.</p>

               <p>REſerving all due Honour to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo far as ſhe holds the Truth in the Thirty Nine Articles, and as ſhe is a good Fortreſs againſt much Popiſh Superſtition and Idolatry; we ſhall humbly make our Objections in three Particulars,
<list>

From all which we think we may ſafely argue thus:</p>
               <p>It is lawful, juſt, and needful, to maintain a prudent and friendly Separation from ſuch a Church, as does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, hold, and maintain ſuch Things, as are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and actually deſtructive of that Chriſtian Liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made his Churches free; and of that ſacred Baptiſm, and holy Diſcipline, which Chriſt ordained to continue in all Churches to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>But the Church of <hi>England</hi> does believe, hold, and maintain ſuch Things, as are evidently and actually deſtructive of that Chriſtian Liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made his Churches free, and of that ſacred Baptiſm, and holy Diſcipline, which Chriſt ordained to continue in all Churches, to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is lawful, juſt, and needful to maintain a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and friendly Separation from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in her preſent Parochial Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing the <hi>Major</hi> is not to be denied by any Chriſtian, we ſhall endeavour to make good the <hi>Minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To begin with Sacred Baptiſm. It is evident from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and partly from the Confeſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that the Things prerequiſite to Baptiſm, on the part of every one who is to be joined with the Church Militant, or to be baptized, are theſe: 1. They ought to have the Goſpel preached, or ſome way made known to them. 2. To believe the Goſpel. 3. To repent of Sin. And, 4. Willingly to put on Chriſt in Baptiſm. Or to expreſs it in ſhort: They are, firſt, to be dead with Chriſt; and then, ſecondly, to be buried with Chriſt by Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Now that the Church of <hi>England</hi> does hold ſuch Things as are evidently and actually deſtructive of this Baptiſm, may in our Judgment be thus proved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. She believes, holds, and does teach others to hold, That all, or the very moſt of her Church-Members are regenerate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing the Word of God, without Faith, without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or any Knowledg of God; and ſo believes what neither
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43526:27"/>
we, nor any Body elſe can underſtand to be true, and errs in Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet ſhe does not believe that her Members are regenerate at all, till ſhe croſs or ſprinkle them with Water; neither does ſhe know (becauſe ſhe has no ground to believe) that Infants are thereby made anew, ſo as to become the Children of God, and Heirs of Heaven; and believing this without poſſibility (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily) to know it to be true, ſhe errs in Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. She believes, and maintains, that thoſe ought to be baptized, whom ſhe knows do not, cannot believe, nor repent, nor in any meaſure know God, nor any Duty of Religion; and herein ſhe errs (as we conceive) concerning the Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. She believes and maintains, that Sponſors do believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for Infants, or that Infants do perform Faith and Repentance by their Sponſors; and believing theſe things, and teaching her Youth to believe them, without any ground from the Word of God, ſhe believes amiſs, or errs in Faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. She holds, that Perſons may lawfully be baptized when they are aſleep, and does actually pretend to baptize Infants when they are aſleep, which we think verily muſt needs be a very great Error both in Faith and Practice.</p>
               <p n="6">6. She believes, holds, and maintains, that Croſſing or Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is a lawful way of Baptizing, when indeed it is no Baptizing at all. Inſomuch as thoſe that uſe that Mode, dare not ſpeak as they act, ſaying, <hi>I ſprinkle thee in the Name,</hi> &amp;c. their Conſcience bearing them witneſs, that the ſacred Act of baptizing in the Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot be expreſſed by the word, <hi>Sprinkling:</hi> They therefore believing what they know is not true in this matter, muſt needs err in Faith, as well as in their Practice. And this Error has in a manner deſtroyed the way of Baptizing uſed by <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thus tho we grant, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is no leſs zealous for the Doctrine of Baptiſm than our ſelves, yet it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to us, that ſhe hath accidentally loſt this holy Ordinance, both in reſpect of the Subject and Manner of it, and in the due Uſe and End of it, which was not appointed (nor fitted) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive new-boru Infants into the Church Militant. And by this unwarrantable Change ſhe has defaced the State, and loſt the Praiſe of a true Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. becauſe ſhe has not kept this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, as it was delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; but hath
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43526:28"/>
rather ſuppreſſed it, and much oppreſſed thoſe that labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to its due Uſe and Practice in all Churches, which is a great Aggravation of all theſe her Errors in Faith and Practice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Sacred Baptiſm.</p>

               <p>WHat manner of Diſcipline the Church of Chriſt ought to obſerve, is ſufficiently declared, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 5. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. and other places. And it is very well expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in his <hi>Def<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce of the Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England,</hi> in theſe Words: <hi>The manner of proceeding in Excommunication is, firſt by gentle Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and that once or twice, given with the Spirit of Meekneſs, even as a Brother, if the Fault be not notoriouſly known, and next, by open Reprehenſion; afterward by publick Sentence of the Church, to put him from the Company of the Faithful, to deliver him to Satan, to denounce him an Heathen, and a Publican, if no Admonition will ſerve, and the Crimes and Perſons be very offenſive.</hi> Thus he.</p>
               <p>And to this <hi>Diſcipline</hi> we can heartily ſubſcribe, it being indeed the very ſame which is religiouſly obſerved by the Baptized Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in this Age and Nation.</p>
               <p>But where now ſhall this <hi>Diſcipline</hi> be found in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Does any one Aſſembly, or Court, of the Church of <hi>England</hi> obſerve it? Or does ſhe not practiſe that in her Courts, which is too evidently deſtructive of it? For ſo far as we can underſtand, inſtead of this brotherly Admonition, Men are clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinely preſented and accuſed, and often excommunicated for they know not what. What Man is now taught or bound by any Order of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that in caſe his Brother treſpaſs againſt him, by defaming his Reputation, offering Injury to his Perſon, or by wronging him in his Subſtance, to take that brotherly Courſe preſcribed to all Chriſtians, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.? Or if he would take this Courſe, what Congregation is empowred or allowed to hear or determine the Strife, as Sin is in ſuch caſes committed againſt God?
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43526:28"/>
We ſee not how it is poſſible for the Offended, to do his Duty in an orderly way to the Offender; if he go about it, he ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be derided both by Teacher and People: So far is he from obtaining Juſtice againſt the Offender, in any Congregation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe the ancient Diſcipline is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known thing to the People generally. And for want of this Chriſtian Government, are Men continually expoſed to Suits and Troubles in Courts of Law, wherein the Poor can have ſmall Help; as it is written, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 8. (old Tranſlation) <hi>If thou ſeeſt the Poor to be oppreſſed,—marvel not,—for one great Man keepeth touch with another, and the mighty Men are in Authority over the Poor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But that which is more grievous: We do not ſee that open Prophaneneſs can be met with, or ſuppreſſed by your Diſcipline: For ſuppoſe a Man be given to Swearing, Lying, Drunkenneſs, and laſcivious Talking, (as God knows, a great Number of the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are known to be ſuch) your Diſcipline ſeems to have no power in ſuch Caſes: for thus ſaith one of your own Miniſters:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who minds Canon</hi> 109, <hi>that prohibits common Swearers, common Drunkards, notorious Whoremaſters, and Whores,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>from the bleſſed Sacrament of the Lord's Supper? Do not even Biſhops hear Men ſwear a thouſand Oaths, and either do not, or dare not uſe any Diſcipline againſt them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now if a good Man do not ſtand up, and bow to the Altar at the Name of Jeſus, when the Creed is read, becauſe he dares not pay greater Reverence (in a religious way) to any Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, than he pays to the holy Scriptures; If he dares not uſe the Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, nor ſprinkle his Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then ſhall he be proſecuted as a great Sinner, caſt to the Devil, and laid in Priſon; yea, he is ſentenced already: For in <hi>Canon</hi> 6. thus we read: <hi>Whoſoever ſhall affirm, that the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of</hi> England <hi>are—ſuperſtitious, or ſuch—as Men who are zealouſly and godlily affected, may not with any good Conſcience approve them, uſe them, or as Occaſion requireth, ſubſcribe unto them; let him be excommunicated</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>and not reſtored, until he repent, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly revoke ſuch his wicked Errors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Thus (as we conceive) the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of Righteouſneſs, Mercy, and Charity, eſtabliſhed by Chriſt, is laid aſide; and a Mercenary Court ſet up, holding the Traditions of Men, inſtead
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43526:29"/>
of Chriſt's Inſtitutions, in Eccleſiaſtical Government, who alſo live voluptuouſly upon the Sins of the People. But as for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of evil Manners, or the making Peace and Concord, alas! it is not ſought for, nor indeed expected from theſe Courts. And as the Reverend <hi>Groſthead</hi> ſaid at <hi>Rome,</hi> when he ſaw all things ruled by Money, ſo may I ſay of the Courts under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>O Money, Money, what wilt thou not do there?</hi> As for the opprobrious Language prohibited by the <hi>Canon,</hi> we think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely for any to uſe it, tho we diſſent from the Ceremonies themſelves.</p>

            <div n="4" type="section">
               <head>SECT. IV. <hi>Concerning Impoſing of Ceremonies.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. ALL Divine Ceremonies ordained by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, we reverence, and religiouſly obſerve and keep, as they were delivered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That any Church ſince their days, hath juſt power to make and ordain Divine Ceremonies, to be any neceſſary parts of the Worſhip of God, we ſee no ground to believe; much leſs, that ſuch Ceremonies may lawfully be impoſed under pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, Baniſhment, Impriſonment, Loſs of Eſtate and Life. For tho it is certain, God has given power to the Rulers of the World, to make, change, or diſannual Laws in point of Civil Government; yet we believe all the Power on Earth cannot make one Inſtitute or Divine Ceremony in Religion. And therefore we cannot but think the Church of <hi>England</hi> erred from the Rule of Righteouſneſs, in decreeing Rites and Ceremonies which God has not commanded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For when we ſee how ſharply fome were reprehended by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for bringing the Chriſtian Churches in <hi>Galatia</hi> under ſome Legal Ceremonies, which once had a divine Original and Uſe in the Church of God, as <hi>Invaders of the Liberty wherewith Chriſt had made them free;</hi> averring alſo, <hi>That if they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them, Chriſt ſhould profit them nothing. Gal.</hi> 5. 1, 2. We can ſee no ground to free the Proteſtants from Sin, who either
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43526:29"/>
take up Scriptureleſs <hi>Ceremonies</hi> from the Papiſts, or invent <hi>Ceremonies</hi> themſelves; but leaſt of all, when they force Men, will they, nill they, to conform to ſuch <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or elſe to be ejected, and delivered up to Satan. And ſurely it was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable for her Biſhops to conſent to a Law, that pious Men, only diſſenting in theſe things <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>See the 35th of</hi> Elizabeth.</note> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be baniſhed, or elſe hanged as Felons, without Benefit of the Clergy. And we humbly deſire, that the Severity of that Law may be conſidered and mitigated.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if it ſhall be ſaid, That the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as the Sprinkling of Infants, the Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm, bowing to the Altar, to name no more at preſent) are not ſinful; then how ſhall we be ever able to reprove a Papiſt, for uſing holy Water, bowing to the Image of Chriſt? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly, if we muſt ſubmit to the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in her preſent <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> we muſt ſubmit to theirs too, where they have power on their ſide to enforce them. But he that ſhall impartially conſider what a learned Proteſtant hath ſaid of the Sinfulneſs of that one <hi>Ceremony</hi> of the Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm, in his Book entituled, <hi>Againſt Symbolizing with Antichriſt in Ceremonies,</hi> will ſee great cauſe to avoid touching with any ſuch Inventions, however they may be ſuppoſed to have had an harmleſs Uſe among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at the firſt.</p>
               <p>But who ſees not, that when ſuch <hi>Ceremonies</hi> have got the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Religion upon them, and are forced on by humane Laws, what incredible Miſeries they have brought upon the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> World? How have they lorded it over Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, over the Eſtates, Liberties and Lives of Chriſtians? Who ſees not, that being thus ſet up, they are ſometimes more ſet by, than ſincere Faith, and an holy Life? as if all true Religion (and <hi>Loyalty</hi> too) were only to be judged of according to Mens Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to thoſe Humane Innovations. For it is notorious, even in this our Land, that let a Man but conform to all the Ceremonies, he ſhall live honourably, let his Life be never ſo debauched almoſt: But let a Man refuſe theſe Ceremonies, out of conſcience to God, becauſe they are not from Heaven, then he is Envy's Mark, let his Life be never ſo juſt and harmleſs. Such Effects ſhould lead us to conſider what the Cauſes are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:43526:30"/>
And becauſe we are ſpeaking of Ceremonies, we crave leave to enquire, <hi>What means the Ceremony of the Ring in Marriage?</hi> Why are we forced not only to uſe it, but to uſe it <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy-Ghoſt?</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> blames the Papiſts for ſaying Marriage is a Sacrament; but ſhall we then make a Sacrament of a Ring? Sure you make the Ring as ſacred in Marriage, as you make the Water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. Such Uſages as theſe, we fear, give the Papiſts too much cauſe to uſe this Speech, <hi>A Proteſtant is but a Papiſt ſcar'd out of his Wits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not then any thing of Prejudice or Obſtinacy, which makes us to ſtand off from the <hi>Communion of the Church of England,</hi> but an unfeigned Deſire to ſerve God aright, and a godly Fear, leſt by touching with theſe unwritten Traditions, we ſhould bring our Souls under Guilt in the ſight of God. Howbeit, if any can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> is juſtifiable in theſe things here objected, we ſhall ſuſpect our ſelves to be miſtaken in other things, which we here mention not.</p>
               <p>Now may it pleaſe the God of Heaven, to put it into the Hearts of the Guides of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to conſider theſe things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That none of theſe Ceremonies about which we differ from them, are required of Chriſtians in the Holy Scriptures.</hi> And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>To enforce them by Excommunication and Penal Laws upon the Conſciences of Men, is more than God requires of you, or any Body elſe.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>And ſurely if the making theſe things neceſſary to our <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> were but removed, ſo that Things which are not delivered in the Word of God were left at liberty, we ſhould not ſtand at ſo great a diſtance from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as now we do: For tho we are verily perſuaded, that theſe Things objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by us are Errors, and therefore prudently to be amended; yet we believe the impoſing of them is a thouſand times more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive in the ſight of God, and more grievous to the Souls of Men, becauſe (as we conceive) God's Authority is then uſurped by Man, and Mens Fear towards him is then taught by the Precepts of Men.</p>
               <p>And yet we know, and indeed muſt confeſs, that many Things, as to the more convenient performance of Religious Services in a Church-way, are left to the Prudence of the Church, guided
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43526:30"/>
therein by the general Rules in the Word of God; and ſome Things alſo (which are not of the Eſſence of Chriſtianity) will ſeem doubtful to ſome, and clear to others. And therefore there will be a continual Neceſſity of brotherly Forbearance one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, in ſome ſinleſs Ceremonies, as many Things may be ſo eſteemed, whilſt not made the Boundaries of Communion, and forced upon Chriſtians againſt their Conſciences. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: tho Sitting be the moſt ſafe Geſture at the Lord's Table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neareſt to Chriſt's Example; yet if any in Humility, and of Devotion to God, think it their Duty to receive kneeling, this ſurely cannot juſtly offend any Chriſtian. And thus alſo bowing at the Name of Jeſus, being left at liberty, when, where, and upon what occaſion the Conſcience of a Chriſtian may be moſt preſſed to do it, need not offend any, tho it is apparent ſuch bowing is not the meaning of the Text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. And the ſame may be ſaid of well-compoſed Prayers; ſo that ſtill ſuch Forms be uſed as a matter of Chriſtian Liberty, and not impoſed by Law as neceſſary.</p>
               <p>And could Things be managed with ſuch Moderation, (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the State of the Inhabitants of this Land does much call for it) in a friendly and brotherly Spirit, 'tis hoped our Animoſities would abate, and Charity would endear all that are upright to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God one towards another, tho labouring under many Weakneſſes, or dark Circumſtances. But whilſt one Party ſtands up with a Sword in their hand, or with power to thruſt Men into Goal, and rifle their Eſtates, unleſs they will all ſubmit to their Will and Pleaſure, not only without, but perhaps in ſome things againſt the Word of God, <hi>(the pretended Rule to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in Matters of Religion)</hi> this lays a Neceſſity upon all that are of Noble and truly Chriſtian Spirits, to teſtify againſt ſuch Cruelty, and unmanly Proceedings, and to aſſert the true Chriſtian Doctrine and Liberty, and Chriſt's Sovereign Authority only, to make Laws for his Church, as ſuch, altho for ſo doing they ſuffe the Loſs of all Things which are dear to them in this World; and therewithal, to ſtand off from the Communion of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Men, as have not learned to do to others, as they would have others to do to them under their differing Opinions, when in a ſtate of Subjection to thoſe who differ from them.</p>

Thus much briefly of the Reaſons or Cauſes of our Separation. We will now conſider what Mr. <hi>N. Taylor</hi> brings to make good <hi>Poedobaptiſm.</hi> And the rather, becauſe he ſays he has defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Infant-Baptiſm both by Scripture and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Let us hear how he doth this.</p>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> NATHANIEL TAYLOR'S <hi>Fourteen Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for Infant-Baptiſm, conſidered and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BEfore we anſwer his Arguments, we will take notice of ſome of his Conceſſions. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſaith, <hi>Baptiſm of Water is not abſolutely neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> pag. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He tells us, <hi>St. Paul joins the Word of God with this Baptiſm, in order to the purifying Chriſt's Church, that acting on the Soul, and this terminating on the Body. And that St.</hi> Peter's <hi>Aſſertion is clear that it is not Water purifying the Fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God that ſaveth.</hi> pag. 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He tells us alſo, <hi>That the premiſing the Word DISCIPLE</hi> (Matth. 28. 19.) <hi>implies none to be capable of Baptiſm, who are not Diſciples of Chriſt, and Members of the Church.</hi> pag. 10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And further, <hi>That Chriſt would have his Ordinances performed by an external Adminiſtration, wherein the ſubject might be in the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt capacity of underſtanding.</hi> pag. 81, 82.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He grants, <hi>That Childrens Baptiſm, and Church-Memberſhip, are not mentioned in the New Teſtament.</hi> pag. 51.</p>
                  <p>From all which a Man may very fairly argue, and conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant-Baptiſm thus.</p>
                  <p>If Infants are undoubtedly ſaved without Baptiſm; and are Members of Chriſt's Church without Baptiſm, and that the Word of God muſt act upon the Soul in true Baptiſm, ſo as that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Baptiſm muſt have the anſwer of a good Conſcience: And
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43526:31"/>
if none be capable of Baptiſm, till they be Diſciples of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. and ought to be in the neareſt capacity of underſtanding what is done in the external adminiſtration of Baptiſm. And if Infant-Church-Memberſhip and Baptiſm be not mentioned in the New Teſtament; then Infants ought not to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>But all this is true, ſaith Mr. <hi>Taylor:</hi> Therefore I conclude In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ought not to be baptized. And thus his Book (I will not ſay (as he) may be ſoon blown away; but it) may ſeem to be ſoon anſwered: And his learned Title very unſuitable. For how ſhall <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, when it is not mention'd in the new Teſtament; can that be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxal Baptiſm which is not mentioned there? Sure this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.</p>
                  <p>But let us hear his Arguments, by which he undertakes to <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Infant-Baptiſm both by Scripture and Reaſon.</hi>

                        <hi>If our Chriſtian Privileges be as great as the Jews were, then our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are rightly baptized: But our Chriſtian Privileges are as great as the Jews were: Therefore our Children are rightly Baptized.</hi>

                     <div type="answer">
                        <head>ANSWER.</head>
                        <p>Becauſe Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſays he offers his Reaſons for Infant-Baptiſm, in order to a compoſure of Differences, and I do believe he means as he ſays; I ſhall therefore endeavour to anſwer them with all Love and Sincerity, as becomes a Chriſtian. And, I ſay,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That upon a fair Diſtinction, both Propoſitions may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. For, if the Queſtion be of external Privileges only; then whether we reſpect outward Advantages in the World, or Rites and Ceremonies in the Church pertinent to Infants; the <hi>Minor</hi> is to be denied: for the <hi>Jews</hi> were under a ſure Promiſe of a fruitful Land, and external Peace and Glory, as a Nation, whilſt they did truly walk according to the Laws of God, of which Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges their Children were partakers as well as others. But on the other ſide, the Chriſtian Church by how much ſhe is more faithful,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43526:32"/>
by ſo much the more is ſhe ſubject to Perſecution: As may be ſeen in the differing eſtate of the faithful Church at <hi>Smyrna, Rev.</hi> 2. 8, 9. and the unfaithful Church at <hi>Laodicea, Rev.</hi> 3. 17. Or if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect Rites and Ceremonies, then 'tis certain, even in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Chriſtians, the Jews had more Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies belonging to their Infants, than belongs to <note rend="inter">
                              <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 22, 23, 24. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Lev. c.</hi> 12.</note> Chriſtian Infants. For beſides the Rite of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, there was an Offering to be offered for them, and they were to be preſented in the Temple, and to partake of the Paſſover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 47, 48. (and therefore Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> does ill to deny it, <hi>pag.</hi> 92.) Whereas the <hi>Poedobaptiſts</hi> only contend for the external Rite of Baptiſm to belong to their Infants.</p>
                        <p>But if by the Word <hi>Privileges</hi> in the Argument be meant ſome higher thing than external Ceremonies, then the <hi>Minor</hi> is true: For as God was gracious to Infants in the Jewiſh Nation, as to the Buſineſs of Salvation: So is he ſuch to the Infants of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Nation in the World.</p>
                        <p>But if now you be diſpleaſed, becauſe I do not prefer, or at leaſt equalize Chriſtians Infants with Jewiſh Infants, in reſpect of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ceremonies. Then let me freely tell you, that I do believe the Privileges of Chriſtians is greater than the Jews, even in this, that God accepts our Infants to his Grace, and to Glory, <hi>without impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Burthen of any Ceremony at all upon them.</hi> For ſeeing he has by the Goſpel taken away that bloody Ceremony of Circumciſion, and by our Lord Chriſt declared Infants to have right to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, without impoſing any Ceremony upon them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Circumciſion, I ſay, herein our Privileges are greater than the Jews, and in this Senſe I confirm your <hi>Minor.</hi> But then <hi>I deny the Conſequence of your Major:</hi> For you may plainly ſee that our Chriſtian Privileges (when compared with the Jews) ſtand not in having external Ceremonies, but rather in being freed from them. Even as it cannot be doubted but that the Children of <hi>Seth, Henoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah, &amp;c.</hi> had as great Privileges as the Jews, and yet it is certain <hi>[and plainly confeſſed by Auguſtine]</hi> that they had no Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or ſign of Regeneration belonging to them that we read of. <hi>Aug. de Civ.

                     <head>Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Argument 2.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe who were Circumciſed under the Law, may be baptized under the Goſpel: But Children were Circumciſed under the Law: Therefore they may be baptized under the Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <div type="answer">
                        <head>ANSWER.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. I anſwer to the <hi>Major.</hi> If by <hi>[Thoſe]</hi> you mean all thoſe that were Circumciſed under the Law: Then the <hi>Major</hi> is not true. For firſt, all Male-Servants which were bought with Money, muſt <hi>needs</hi> be Circumciſed, they might not elſe dwell in the Family: <hi>(Gen.</hi> 17. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 44, 48, 49.) But no ſuch impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is laid upon Families under the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If by <hi>[Thoſe]</hi> you mean Infants, then I deny your <hi>Major:</hi> For tho Infants were Circumciſed under the Law, it does not follow that Infants may be Baptized under the Goſpel: Nor do your Arguments, brought to make it good, prove it at all. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Tho Baptiſm ſucceeds Circumciſion as the Sacrament of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiation, yet it does not follow, that the ſame Perſons, or Perſons no otherwiſe qualified than the Infants of the Jews, or Servants bought with Money, are to be admitted to Baptiſm; becauſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion belonged to the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as ſuch, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Covenant or no (as in the caſe of <hi>Iſhmael,)</hi> and to his Servants as ſuch. But Baptiſm being the Sacrament or waſhing of Regeneration, belongs to thoſe who are born from above (as ſuch); Hence 'tis ſaid, Gal. 3. 28. <hi>We are Abraham's Seed, becauſe we are Chriſt's,</hi> ſo, as to have <hi>crucified the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts:</hi> Gal. 4. 24. And not that they are Chriſt's, becauſe they are <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed. This vaſt difference therefore between the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants of the Church Jewiſh, and the Church Chriſtian, ſhews a great difference between the carnal Ordinances of the Law, and the ſpiritual Ordinances of the Goſpel: ſo that it is no good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing from Infants Right to the one, to their Right to the other.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. You ſay our Children are <hi>as capable of being Baptized, as the Jews were of being Circumciſed.</hi> But this is denied: for the Jews had a Command to Circumciſe Infants, and that made them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that Ceremony; but without a Command none were capable
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43526:33"/>
of it: For ſome Infants might be as capable of Circumciſion in reſpect of Strength, on the ſeventh Day, as others on the eighth Day; but the Command not empowering any to circumciſe till the eighth Day, made all Children that died before the eighth Day uncapable of Circumciſion. Again, you will not ſay that any Man, as ſuch only, is capable of Baptiſm, becauſe you grant they muſt firſt be Diſciples, and, as ſuch, baptized. Nor will you ſay, that all Infants, as ſuch only, may be baptized, becauſe you do not think God has required the Infants of the Turks to be baptized. So then, unleſs you can ſhew that God has required our Infants to be baptized, they have no capacity for it. We conclude then, whatever may be urged as a Capacity for Baptiſm, yet without a Command from God, to baptize our Infants, is meer Will-Worſhip and Preſumption.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. You ſay, <hi>That the Precept of receiving Parent and Child into Covenant ſtands unrepealed to this day.</hi> But if by receiving into <hi>Covenant,</hi> you mean a receiving to the Duties of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> what you ſay is not true; for the <hi>Covenant of Circumciſion</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed. Gal. 5. 2. <hi>Behold, I</hi> Paul <hi>ſay unto you, If ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> And there was never any <hi>Covenant,</hi> but the <hi>Covenant of Circumciſion,</hi> which obliged Parents to bring their Infants to the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of Religion: So then Infants are not under the Burthen of any Ceremonies of Religion at this day. I marvel you ſhould here ſay, <hi>There is no Countermand of the ancient Jewiſh Practice of receiving Children to Circumciſion.</hi> Either the Printer has wrong'd you, or elſe you hold the Jews are yet bound to circumciſe their Infants.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. You argue from <hi>Chriſt's being propoſed as Mediator of a better Covenant,</hi> that therefore this great Privilege (you mean, bringing Infants to Ceremonies of Religion) <hi>is not repealed.</hi> But the Truth is far otherwiſe; for the Covenant of Chriſt as Mediator, is therefore better than the Covenant of the Law, becauſe he has taken theſe Ceremonies out of the way, and accepts poor Infants without any other Ceremony inſtead of them; yea, the Covenant is therefore better to Believers themſelves, in that they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged but to a very few Ceremonies, whilſt the Jews laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a burthenſom Yoke of many Ceremonies. And if your way of arguing were good, it would prove, that the Goſpel is worſe to Believers, than the Law was to the adult Jews, becauſe they had abundance of Religious Privileges, to wit, Ceremonies, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43526:33"/>
Believers have but a very few. Now who would think, that wiſe and good Men ſhould thus grope at Noon-day?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. You quote <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. and ſay, that this Text expreſly avers your Concluſion. But it is certain, the Promiſe there, is not of bringing Infants to any Ceremonies, and ſo does not at all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour your Concluſion; for the Promiſe being of the pouring out of the Gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt, according to the Prophecy of <hi>Joel,</hi> concerns not Infants in Infancy, ſaith Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor.</hi> And as for the Precept in the Text, [to wit, <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of you,]</hi> 'tis as certain that concerns not Infants; for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are juſt Perſons, which need no Repentance, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as little need the Baptiſm of Repentance. I rather there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adhere to Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor,</hi> than to Mr. <hi>Nath. Taylor</hi> in this Caſe; and I find that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Diodate</hi> do expound this Text as we do.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Now, Sir, your great Strait ſeems to be this: You think the Children of Heathens have as great Privileges as we allow to the Infants of Chriſtians. Let me anſwer freely; I do believe, that through the Grace of Chriſt their Infants, dying ſuch, are in as ſure a capacity for Salvation as our Infants. And why ſhould this offend, that ſeeing Infants are equally concluded under Sin in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> God ſhould have equally Mercy upon them in the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> Nay, does not Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> himſelf tell us, <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>That it's dreadful to believe, that all Infants which die unbaptized, are damned.</hi> And that any of them ſhall be damned, he cannot prove, ſeeing he ſays, <hi>He cannot implead them of Sin, in not being baptized, being not capable of deſiring it.</hi> Well, I thank him for this, and ſhall requite him by granting, Chriſtians Infants are more happy in ſome gracious reſpects, than the Infants of the Heathen, being the Seed of many Prayers, and piouſly devoted therein to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God from the Womb, and have the Advantage of an early Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Chriſtian Religion, that they may be as timely bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized as may be: On the other ſide, the Infants of the Heathens are perhaps devoted to Idols, as the Jews did ſometimes devote theirs to <hi>Moloch.</hi> But yet, as we do not think that God ſent the Jews Infants to burn in Hell, becauſe their Parents burnt them to <hi>Moloch;</hi> ſo neither ought we to think, that he will puniſh the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of the Heathen with Devils, becauſe their Parents devoted them to Idols; for as for poor Infants, what have they done?</p>
                        <p n="7">

7. You anſwer not our Objections, by ſaying, <hi>The Covenant of Grace,</hi> Gen. 17. 10, 13. <hi>is permanent to the Worlds end,</hi> &amp;c. For tho this were true, yet that the Ceremonies which there accompany that Covenant, were to continue to the World's End, and ſhould pertain to Infants to the World's End, you neither believe your ſelf, nor can any Man prove, that any Ceremonies by Order from Chriſt ſhould belong to Infants to the World's end, ſeeing it is granted, that Infant-Baptiſm is not mentioned in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And if I yield you your five Conſiderations following, <hi>pag.</hi> 33. I do not ſee that you gain any thing as to the Point in queſtion; I therefore proceed.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. I think you miſtake, where you write that we ſay, <hi>Thoſe that had Right to Circumciſion were a ſpiritual Seed;</hi> for we know that the Carnal Seed had Right to it: What therefore you would build upon this Miſtake falls of it ſelf. But whereas you would infer, that Baptiſm, as well as Circumciſion, belongs to the carnal Seed, it is certainly a great Error. It is true, ſome that are Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites may come to Sacred Baptiſm, but then they profeſs (at leaſt) to be otherwiſe, and are not admitted as Hypocrites, nor as Men only, (as you ſeem to urge, <hi>Numb.</hi> 2, <hi>p.</hi> 34.) but as they declare themſelves Chriſtians, or ſpiritual. And therefore it is ſaid of the whole Church, <hi>Ye are all the Sons of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus; for as many as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 3. 26, 27. And again, Col. 2. <hi>Ye are circumciſed with the Circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt. [Therefore,</hi> Rom. 6.] <hi>we are buried with him in Baptiſm.</hi> And beſides this, your Church makes Baptiſm a viſible Sign of an inward or ſpiritual Grace; and does affirm of all whom ſhe admits to Baptiſm, that <hi>they are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, and born anew:</hi> Which ſhews that in this Point we agree, that the inward Work of Grace ſhould be in all that are baptized.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. I grant, that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> were ſanctified, or ſeparated to God from the Womb, the one to be a Prophet, the other to be the Fore-runner of our Lord Chriſt; yet I deny, that theſe extraordinary Caſes are to be made the Rules for us to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize by. God knows what we will be from our Birth to our Death; but theſe Things are hid from us. Things revealed and commanded belong to us. We may not preſume to think either of Men or Infants above what is written; to ſay, this is ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Womb, and that not; this is a Believer, and that

                     <div type="answer">
                        <head>ANSWER.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Major</hi> being taken univerſally, for all that are in the Covenant of Grace, then it is to be denied; for God never made that the Rule of Baptizing. Nay, when Circumciſion was in the greateſt uſe, yet all that were in the Covenant of Grace were not to be circumciſed. Such were the many Thouſands of Male In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, who died before they were eight days old; theſe were in Covenant, and their Salvation as ſure as if they had been circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. The Females alſo were in Covenant, yet not to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. If you ſay they were not capable, learned Authors tell you otherwiſe, and name ſome Nations who circumciſe both Sexes to this day. By this you ſee your <hi>Major</hi> runs upon a falſe Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And if by thoſe who are within the Covenant, you mean ſome of thoſe, then your Argument comes ſhort of the Queſtion, viz. <hi>Whether all that are in the Covenant of Grace may be baptized?</hi> But let us try your <hi>Minor.</hi> The <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> hath two parts, 1. <hi>A Declaration of God's Mercy in Mans Redemption;</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I grant, Infants are within the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> 2. <hi>A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Mans Duty in point of Faith and Obedience;</hi> in this Sence I deny Infants to be in the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Let us hear therefore how you confirm your <hi>Minor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. You ſay, <hi>It is verified, in that Baptiſm is the Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant now, as Circumciſion was under the Law, &amp;c. And therefore thoſe who are under the participation of the Covenant, may be admitted to the Seal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But why do our Brethren of the <hi>Church of England</hi> ſpeak of the Seal in the Singular? They uſed to tell us, the Covenant has two Seals, to wit, Baptiſm, and the Table of the Lord. And
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43526:35"/>
I will abide by it, that the Lord's Table is as truly a Seal of the Covenant, as Baptiſm. Yet you deny Infants this Seal, tho you know when they firſt baptized Infants, they alſo brought them to the Lord's Table, and this cuſtom continued ſix hundred Years. But I deny your Conſequence; it follows not, that all that are in Covenant may have the Seal of Baptiſm. And you tell us, <hi>That God's Grace is univerſal,</hi> pag. 37. yet you will not ſay that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is univerſal; it belongs but to thoſe who reſtipulate, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Covenant upon the Terms of Faith and Repentance. Acts 8. 12. <hi>When they believed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they were baptized, both Men and Women.</hi> And here the City of <hi>Samaria</hi> generally received the Goſpel, and yet not an Infant baptized.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But how ſhall I underſtand you, where you ſay, <hi>That Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren never excluded themſelves from the Covenant of Grace, becauſe not actual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, and none but ſuch were ejected?</hi> And where you preſently ſay, <hi>They have the Covenant belonging to them with their believing Parents?</hi> Have Infants no benefit by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, unleſs their Parents believe? Alas! poor Infants! But ſure God does not exclude Infants from the Covenant of Grace, made for Mankind in Chriſt, becauſe their Parents believe not; No, I will hold to your firſt Saying, <hi>That none but actual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers are rejected.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. That the Holineſs mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. is only Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, or Lawfulneſs of Birth, you would have to be only a Gloſs of the Anabaptiſts. But how can you fairly take it for any other, ſeeing it is taken immediately from the Sanctification of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Husband, as the word <hi>[elſe]</hi> being rightly referred, makes evident. Upon which Conſideration, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> expounds this place expreſly as we do, yet he was a Poedobaptiſt. And <hi>Auſtin</hi> long before him ſaid, <hi>Whatever that Holineſs is,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. <hi>it is certain it is not of Power to make Chriſtians, or remit Sins.</hi> Sir, if you conſider the Scope of the place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. you will find, ſome in that Church were in doubt whether they might dwell with their unbelieving Yokefellows. St. <hi>Paul</hi> reſolves the Doubt in the Affirmative, and gives this Reaſon for it: The unbelieving Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is ſanctified to the believing Wife; and if he were not ſo, their Children were unclean, but he being ſanctified, their Children were clean; for Marriage is honourable among all, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Bed undefiled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. Therefore let not the Husband put away his Wife, nor the Wife depart from her Husband.</p>

7. What you ſay further to this Argument, being built upon a wrong Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That we deny Infants to be within the Covenant of Grace, falls of it ſelf.

                        <hi>Thoſe who have right to the Bleſſings of the Covenant, have right to Baptiſm: But Children have right to the Bleſſings of the Covenant: Therefore they have right to Baptiſm.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. This Argument is upon the matter the ſame with the former, and therefore upon the former diſtinction the <hi>Major</hi> is denied: for tho Infants have right to all the Bleſſings of the Covenant which they have need of, yet they have no right to the Duties of the Covenant, which they have no need of, becauſe God requires no Duties of them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And tho you ſay, that <hi>our Conceſſion (that Infants are within the Covenant of Grace) proves that Infants have right to all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Covenant;</hi> Yet this is contrary to your own Judgment, for you your ſelves deny them right to the Lord's Table, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all other Privileges, as much as we do, except your Croſſing and Sprinkling them.

                        <hi>Thoſe who are capable of being engaged in Covenant with God, are capable of Baptiſm: But Children are capable of being engaged in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God: Therefore Children are capable of Baptiſm.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. This Argument, (as moſt of the reſt) may be retorted thus;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43526:36"/>
They that are capable of being engaged in Covenant with God, are capable of the Lord's Table: But Infants are capable of being engaged in the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> They are capable of the Lord's Table. Which ſufficiently ſhews the unſoundneſs of your Argument. But let us examine the proof of your <hi>Major.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. To this purpoſe you tell us, <hi>That Infants are in the Power of their Parents, to diſpoſe of, as to Temporals and Spirituals.</hi> And your Reaſon is, becauſe Parents are obliged to take the greateſt care imaginable of their Childrens Souls, for their Education in the Fear of God. Well, now I ſee why you uſe not the word <hi>Infants,</hi> but <hi>Children,</hi> all along in your Arguments: you know that Infants, ſuch as you Sprinkle, are not capable of any Education at all. They cannot be taught the Fear of God. They then cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Covenant by the Means of Education, nor can they in that State be brought up in his Service, in reſpect of Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: So that inſtead of proving, you have loſt your <hi>Minor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. What you argue, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 11, 12, 14. will never prove that Infants are capable of entering into Covenant with God in their own Perſons; but that their Parents did engage to bring them up in the Laws of God; and what this is to the purpoſe, I do not imagine. Is it therefore my Duty to baptize my Children, without a Command from God to do ſo, meerly becauſe by the Covenant of Grace, and Rules of Chriſtianity, I am to do my beſt to teach my Children the Fear of the Lord? This is very inconſequent, and will as much oblige me to bring my Infants to the Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as I have ſhewed. This laſt you will not allow, becauſe God requires it not; and for the ſame Reaſon I refuſe to bring my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to Baptiſm, tho I believe it my Duty to do all that I can to engage them in Covenant with God, by Chriſtian Education in the Fear of God, that they may ſerve him in all his Commands and Ordinances blameleſs.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Wherefore in Anſwer to your Argument: If by Infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable of being engaged in Covenant with God, you mean the Parents engagement to educate them in the Fear of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then I deny your <hi>Major,</hi> and ſay, Thoſe who are only capable thus to be engaged with God in Covenant, are not capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. But if you mean, a perſonal and actual entring into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, then I deny your <hi>Minor,</hi> and all the Experience of the World confutes you.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. That the Children of converted Jews, loſt not their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, is not true, if by Privileges you intend Ceremonies; but if by Privileges you mean a being delivered from the Law of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, then I grant it. And it is certainly a greater Privilege that Children are under a declared Right to the Kingdom of God by Chriſt, and his gracious bleſſing a part of them, as a Pledg for the whole, than if he had ordained a Law to baptize them in order thereunto. And it is alſo certain, that the Jewiſh Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, being diſſolved upon the Death of Chriſt, and the Goſpel-Church, confirmed in the Gift of Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No Perſon could rightly ſtand a Member of the Jewiſh Church, which was the only Church that ever had command from God to bring their Infants to Rites of Religion.</p>

And ſure I am, that none are truly of Satan's Kingdom, but ſuch as are his Subjects. For he has no right over any by Creation, and Purchaſe, as God and Chriſt have. Now it being clear, that Infants are none of Satan's Subjects, it muſt needs be very injurious, to ſay they are viſibly of his Kingdom. But being Created by God, and Redeemed by Chriſt, and never offended in their own Perſons, it is rational to think they are in God's Favour, as it appears the Infants of the <hi>Ninevites</hi> were, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.

                        <head>ANSWER.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Minor</hi> is denied. Infants are not Diſciples of Chriſt, neither does God and Chriſt own them for ſuch, <hi>as you affirm.</hi> But you bring <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1, 2, 10. to prove it, and ſay, <hi>That the Yoak which the Jews would have laid upon the new converted Gentiles, was Circumciſion, which pertained to Children who were Circumciſed the eighth day, and yet it is laid too upon the Diſciples Necks.</hi> But Sir, do you think this to be rational, that becauſe the Jews would have laid the Yoak of Circumciſion on the Necks of the Diſciples, that therefore all were Diſciples upon whom they would have laid that Yoak? ſure this is a very unlawful Conſequence: No better than this; You would lay the Yoak of Croſſing and Sprinkling upon Infants, therefore all are Infants upon whom you would lay the Yoak of Croſſing and Sprinkling. Again, they that were preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> were Men and Women: Therefore all that were preſerved in the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> were Men and Women. You may eaſily ſee theſe Conſequences are very untrue, and verily ſo is yours. For tho the falſe Apoſtles would have laid the Yoak of Circumciſion upon the Necks of the Diſciples, yet all were not Diſciples whom they would have Circumciſed: for 'tis ſaid, <hi>They taught the Brethren, except they were Circumciſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they could not</hi>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:43526:38"/>
                           <hi>be ſaved.</hi> But you cannot imagine that they taught Infants.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Acts</hi> 15. be diligently read, it will expound it ſelf; for <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. the Diſciples are ſaid to be ſuch as from among the Gentiles were turned to God. And all that are called Diſciples, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. are called Brethren, and as ſuch they are written unto by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. And the Epiſtle is ſaid to be read to all the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude (meaning of the Diſciples,) who thereupon are ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice for the Conſolation: Sure theſe were no Infants.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But you ſay, <hi>They are Diſciples in that; tho Man cannot teach them, yet God can, and may.</hi> Well, I thank you for your Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. It is true (as you ſay) Man cannot teach, or make Infants Diſciples; and then to be ſure, they are not intended by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to be made Diſciples, by what he ſays in your Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. For all that are to be made Diſciples, by that Commiſſion, are to be made ſuch by Men: So that you are evidently beſides your Text, in all that you ſay to this Argument, and you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide your own Expoſition of your Text alſo, which I will here ſet down, as you give it, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Going to Diſciple all Nations, inſtruct them in the Principles of my Religion; and then being Diſciples, baptize them: So that there is a Diſcipleſhip pre-exiſtent to Baptiſm; and indeed the premiſing the Word DISCIPLE, implies none to be capable of Baptiſm, who are not Diſciples of Chriſt, and Members of his Church.</hi> Theſe are your Words. 'Tis true, you ſay Infants will be proved to be Diſciples. But ſurely, not by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as you do here, that God can make them Diſciples, or teach them: For it is no good arguing from what God can do, to ſay he has done it, or will do it. For God can, of the Stones in the Street, raiſe up Children unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> but I may not therefore ſay the Stones in the Srreet are the Children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> You ſay indeed, that God hath given ſeveral inſtances of his teaching ſeveral from the Womb, but you can neither name the Perſons, nor ſhew us what he taught them; however if you could, ſuch miraculous Operations are not given for general Rules. God once taught a dumb Aſs to ſpeak, and to reprove a Prophet; but it would be bad arguing from this inſtance, that Aſſes are Diſciples: And yet this is a clearer inſtance of God's teaching the Aſs, than you can give of his teaching any Infant.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But ſeeing you put Infants Diſcipleſhip upon the account of God's teaching them, you muſt have ſome competent ground to believe that he has miraculouſly taught them, before you baptize

them; or elſe you deſtroy your Expoſition of the Text, which avers, <hi>That there is a Diſcipleſhip pre-exiſtent to Baptiſm.</hi> And when you ſhall ſhew me the Infant whom God hath taught, or made a Diſciple, I believe I ſhall not oppoſe your Baptizing that Infant, and this is as much as you can deſire.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But you ſay further, <hi>That God hath promiſed to teach Children.</hi> What, Sir, in their Infancy? Let us ſee your Proofs; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 13. <hi>All thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the Peace of thy Children.</hi> John 6. 45. <hi>It is written in the Prophets, and they ſhall be all taught of God. Every Man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> Certainly had you read thoſe Texts with their Coherence, and conſidered, that our Saviour himſelf in the latter expounds the former, you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have imagined, that God here promiſes to teach any Infants, much leſs all the Infants in the Chriſtian Nations; for it is very apparent, they that are taught according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>have heard and learned of the Father, ſo as to come to Chriſt.</hi> And indeed the meaning is, that God ſpeaking to us by his Son, (who is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.) had now made good that gracious Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 13. <hi>All thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord.</hi> But you have another Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47. <hi>Can any Man forbid Water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, who have received the Holy-Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> Now he that reads this place, will eaſily ſee, that the Perſons here ſpoken of were only ſuch as were aſſembled to hear <hi>Peter, in whatſoever they ſhould be commanded of God; and that the Holy-Ghoſt fell on all that heard the Word.</hi> Which place therefore can with no ſhew of Reaſon be brought, to prove that Infants are taught of God. However, when you ſhall find an Infant, that has <hi>received the Holy-Ghoſt, as well as the Apoſtles;</hi> then for my part I ſhall not forbid Water, that you ſhould baptize him, provided you firſt be baptized your ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. You will have Infants to be Diſciples, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> (you ſay) <hi>commands the receiving of them in his Name;</hi> and you quote <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 16, 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 47. I have carefully read all theſe places, but can find no <hi>Command</hi> to receive Infants in the Name of Chriſt, much leſs to receive them by Baptiſm. It is true, <hi>Chriſt called a little Child unto him, and ſaid, Whoſoever ſhall receive this Child in my Name, receiveth me.</hi> Now this Child was able to know what Chriſt ſaid, and is no fit Inſtance to prove an Infant of eight days old to be a Diſciple of Chriſt; neither does
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43526:39"/>
this Text call this Child a Diſciple, but the Diſciples are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from it. And yet it (and ſo any little Child) may be a good Precedent even to Diſciples, to learn Humility and Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by; and ſo may a Lamb or a Dove ſerve to teach us to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and harmleſs, yet they are not therefore Diſciples. Neither can the receiving this Child, (or any other in like caſe) be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of receiving them by Baptiſm; for then you may read the place thus, <hi>Whoſoever baytizeth a Child in my Name, baptizeth me;</hi> but this is both falſe and abſurd. And beſides, he that is baptized, may be rather ſaid to receive Chriſt, than he that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth, in that Action. Or would you make our Saviour to ſay, He that baptizeth an Infant in my Name, receiveth me? If ſo, I would know by what Authority you take the word, <hi>receiveth,</hi> for baptizing in the firſt place, and in the ſecond for ſomething elſe. Surely, if to baptize an Infant in the Name of Chriſt, be a receiving of Chriſt, it's an eaſy thing to receive Chriſt, eſpecially for the Prieſt, who pretends to baptize Infants daily. But ſure it is as much the Duty of other Chriſtians to receive Children in the Name of Chriſt, as the Prieſts; for the Word is, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall receive this Child in my Name;</hi> and therefore it cannot be meant of baptizing them, and then theſe Scriptures prove not your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. You urge, that Infants are Members of Earthly Kingdoms, and I grant it; and alſo I grant, that they belong to the Kingdom of Heaven, and ſo are of the Univerſal Church: But this proves not that they are Diſciples at all; for the Infants of Heathens are Members of Kingdoms, and may go to Heaven, and yet you think they are no Diſciples for all that. And if Infants may in ſome Sence be ſaid to be God's Servants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 91. yet this proves not that they are Diſciples; for all Creatures, as well ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, vegetative, as rational, are ſaid to be his Servants, yet all Creatures are not Chriſt's Diſciples.</p>

If the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition be taken univerſally, that to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Chriſt granted impoſition of Hands (or touching) in any caſe, that to them belongs Baptiſm, then the <hi>Major</hi> is not true; for he touched or put his hand upon the dead, yet Baptiſm belongs not to the dead, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 14. If it be ſaid, Chriſt touched the Bier, not the Dead; I anſwer: He touched the Childrens Cloaths, when he took them in his Arms; but he took the dead Damſel by the hand, and ſaid, <hi>Talitha, cumi, Damſel, I ſay unto thee, Ariſe.</hi> Mark 5. 41. Thus much to the <hi>Major;</hi> now to the <hi>Minor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. If by laying on of hands, you underſtand that which by Chriſt's Doctrine, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. is made a ſtanding Ordinance in his Church, and in order next to Baptiſm, as is evident you do; then I deny your <hi>Minor:</hi> For that Ordinance was not yet inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, nor uſeful, becauſe the End of it was not yet to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for the Spirit of Promiſe was not yet given, nor as yet to be given, becauſe <hi>Jeſus</hi> was not yet glorified, <hi>John</hi> 7. Wherefore your Miſinterpretation of <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 13, 14, 15. is injurious to Truth, and would prefer theſe Infants to the Apoſtles, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Firſt-fruits of the Spirit, unleſs you think Chriſt laid hands on the Children, without obtaining the End or Eſſect of the Service. So then it's clear, that this laying on of hands, or touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants, (for ſo it is expreſſed both by St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke)</hi> cannot with any fairneſs be underſtood of that laying on of hands which follows Baptiſm, and therefore is no Proof at all for your <hi>Minor.</hi>

                        <p n="3">3.

Or can Chriſtians no other way bring their <hi>Infants</hi> to Chriſt? Or do no <hi>Infants</hi> belong to Chriſt, but thoſe who are ſo brought?

The Conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> may well be denied: for tho it ſhould be ſome ways true, that the Faith of the Parents en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles the Children to the Covenant, yet it follows not, that it entitles them to the performance of, or ſubmiſſion to the Things which they underſtand not, nor are able to perform.

But let us ſee whether the <hi>Minor</hi> be well proved; you quote <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. and think it a clear place to prove that the Faith of the Parents en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles the Children to the Covenant. But this Text ſays not a word to that purpoſe; for <hi>Peter</hi> derives the Title both of Parents and Children from the Promiſe of God: and builds the Title of all the Called of the Lord, and of them that were afar off alſo, upon the Promiſe of God, and not upon the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf. Beſides, the Promiſe here is of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore not pertinent to Infants, as I have ſhewed: Here is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no proof at all of your <hi>Minor.</hi> I think it were better to ſay, that by Faith a Chriſtian knows his Child has an intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, than that his Faith entitles his Child to it. I fear this <hi>Minor</hi> is a very dangerous Aſſertion, and that partly becauſe the Conſequence of ſuch an Opinion is to ſhut out all Infants from the Covenant of Grace, who have not faithful Parents to entitle them to it: And in truth it ſeems to ſwell with too much boldneſs, and carnal preſumption; but I ſpare you.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Faith of the Jews and Proſelites did not entitle their Children to the Covenant of Grace; but they themſelves being

                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Major</hi> being taken univerſally, for all that may go to Heaven, it may very well be denied; for Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Capacity of Salvation to ſome of the Infants of the Jews, and yet Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> himſelf does not think they are capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; for he makes the Faith of the Parents neceſſary to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titling them to Baptiſm, which in this Caſe is wanting.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the greater includes the leſs, is not univerſally true; for Women have a capacity to go to Heaven, yet they have no capacity to be Biſhops, which is leſs than going to Heaven. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not capable of the Lord's Table, which is leſs than to go to Heaven. Indeed, this Argument being admitted to be good, would bring Infants to all Privileges in the Church-Militant, as well as to Baptiſm; for thus a Man might argue: Thoſe who are capable of all the Privileges of the Church Triumphant, are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43526:41"/>
capable of all the Privileges of the Church Militant, (for the greater includes the leſs): But Infants are capable of all Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges in the Church Triumphant; <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> And if it be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable</hi> (as you ſay it is) <hi>to deny the external Sign, to thoſe to whom Chriſt hath granted the internal Grace;</hi> pray, why are you ſo unreaſonable, as to deny your Infants the Sign of the Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſeeing you affirm they are regenerate, and born of Water and the Spirit? But if you were put to prove, that Infants, whom you ſprinkle, have the inward Grace which entitles to Baptiſm, you would never be able to make demonſtration to your own, or any wiſe Man's Satisfaction; for is not the inward and ſpiritual Grace, Repentance, whereby Sin is forſaken, and Faith, whereby the Promiſes of God are ſtedfaſtly believed? And what Infant did you ever know thus qualified for Baptiſm?</p>

                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition, that Infants are Believers, is not true. And I anſwer in the Words of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who ſaith, (Letter of Reſolut. p. 297.) <hi>I ſhall profeſs to be none of thoſe that are concerned in the Queſtion, Whether Infants have Faith? I freely confeſs to believe, that Faith is ſo neceſſarily founded in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, that they that have not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, cannot have Faith, whether actual or habitual.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Jer.

                           </gap> for an Houſhold-Servant. But it is ſufficient to my purpoſe, that you dare not ſay Infants are actual Believers; (nay, you confeſs, <hi>they have not actual Faith:</hi> And for imputative Faith, (if there be any ſuch thing) yet it can be no Rule for the baptizing any Body, ſeeing it is not revealed to whom Faith is imputed; and whilſt you ſay, God may eſteem Infants as Believers, another may as well ſay, he may eſteem them as baptized alſo); I ſay, your granting Infants have not actual Faith, you can take the word, <hi>believeth,</hi> Mat. 18. 6. only by the Figure called <hi>Proſopopoeia,</hi> if you will needs have the Child an Infant of Days. And if it be good arguing from hence to the Baptiſm of Infants, then you may argue as ſtrongly for baptizing the whole Creation, (if you can tell how) for it is ſaid to <hi>groan, expect, and wait for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Sons of God, and to be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption.</hi> Rom. 8. 19. We conclude then, that it is not a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Faith, but an actual Faith, (at leaſt by profeſſion) that entitles to the reception of Baptiſm.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We do not ſay, that God will impute Unbelief to Infants, but only to thoſe that refuſe to believe; and tho we know In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not Believers, yet we do not ſay or think they are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, they being not capable to ſin againſt God in that caſe, or any elſe. And Unbelief preſuppoſes a capacity in the Subject, and means ſufficient, to believe, and yet the Creature refuſes to believe. The Sin of Unbelief therefore being no way chargeable upon any Infant, it follows by neceſſary Conſequence, that they have no capacity for Faith. Neither do we pretend to judg Mens Hearts; for tho God has ordered Faith to be a Pre-requiſite to Baptiſm, yet we are only to judg of the Profeſſion of Faith, not of the Sincerity of it. And as it is true, as you ſay, that Infants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not play the Hypocrite; ſo it's true, they cannot play the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and therefore not fit for the Duties of Chriſtians, of which Baptiſm is one.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. If by the Ends of Baptiſm, you mean the Things which concern God's Mercy in the Redemption of Man only, then the <hi>Major</hi> is denied; but if by the Ends of Baptiſm, you mean the Things required on Mans part, then the <hi>Minor</hi> is not true; for Mortification and Vivification are the Ends of Baptiſm on Man's part, of which Infants are not capable; for they cannot put off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, nor have they any need ſo to do, neither can they riſe to Newneſs of Life. And tho I grant, (and have often ſaid it) that we ought to devote our Children to God in the beſt manner we can; yet to go beyond the Word of the Lord under that pretence, will neither profit us, nor our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. What you ſay here, of Baptiſm being a Seal to Infants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is anſwered before. And ſurely the word <hi>Heathen,</hi> (ſo often uſed by you) as it imports ſometimes an Enemy to God, (yet being of it ſelf of no ill ſignification) Infants are not ſo to be accounted Heathens; nor doth the word, <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as it imports a Follower of Chriſt, belong to Infants. So that this is only a Noiſe of Words, to talk that our Infants are not diſtinguiſhed from the Infants of Heathens, tho I have ſhewed a difference between them.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition is not true, and therefore I do deny, that the Church hath always received Infants to Baptiſm. And indeed you do not ſo much as pretend any thing from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to prove it, but, before, do honeſtly confeſs, <hi>That Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is not mentioned in the New Teſtament;</hi> and therefore certainly it will be impoſſible to prove, that the Church did always receive
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43526:43"/>
Infants to Baptiſm. And it is alſo very obſervable, that <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who wrote the Hiſtory of the Church for four hundred Years after Chriſt, does not ſo much as mention Infant-Baptiſm at all.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But how then does Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> prove his <hi>Minor?</hi> Why, his chief Author to that purpoſe is Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> in his Book called, <hi>A modeſt Plea for Infant-Baptiſm;</hi> which Book in that part has been anſwered by Mr. <hi>De-Laune,</hi> to which I refer the Reader. The Sum of which Anſwer is to prove, that all Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Teſtimonies from Antiquity for Infant-Baptiſm, for the firſt 300 Years after Chriſt, are either invalid, or taken out of forged and ſpurious Books. And it is more than ſufficient to ballance Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s bold Aſſertion, <hi>That the Catholick Church hath always received Infants to Baptiſm,</hi> by the contrary Teſtimonies of <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Barlow;</hi> the firſt expreſly ſaying, <hi>In old Time none was brought to Baptiſm, but he was of ſufficient Years to know what that myſtical Water meant, and to require his Baptiſm, and that ſundry times.</hi> The other tells us, <hi>There is neither Precept nor Practice in Scripture for Infant-Baptiſm, nor any juſt Evidence for it for about</hi> 200 <hi>Years after Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>That for many hundreds of Years the Queſtion</hi> [about Infant-Baptiſm] <hi>was not moved.</hi> But this is a great Miſtake; for <hi>Tertullian</hi> did queſtion it, as an <hi>unwarrantable Practice,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the third Century; as is ſhewed by Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> and others, who have diligently enquired into the ancient Cuſtoms of the Church.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The firſt Inſtance which you bring for the Practice of Infant-Baptiſm in our Nation, is that in King <hi>Ina</hi>'s time, about the Year 692; but we can prove it was oppoſed by the <hi>Britain Biſhops</hi> two hundred Years before this. See <hi>Fabian</hi>'s <hi>Chron. part</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 107.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. You ſay, <hi>The deferring of Baptiſm among the Ancients, was not for their queſtioning Infant-Baptiſm.</hi> But ſure, if they did think themſelves too young to be baptized, at twenty or thirty Years of Age, they could with no reaſon think their Children old enough for Baptiſm at ſeven or eight days old. Extremes have undone all; they were too ſlow, and you are as much too quick. But the proper time for Baptiſm is, when Men attain to the new Birth; Baptiſm is therefore rightly call'd the <hi>Waſhing of Regeneration.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5.

                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition is not true; for our Doctrine in the Caſe of Baptiſm is true, and Truth does not introduce any erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequences. Now that our Doctrine is true, appears thus: Becauſe it fully agrees with your Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. even as it is expounded by your ſelf, in theſe Words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Going to diſciple all Nations, inſtruct them in the Principles of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and then, being Diſciples, baptize them.</hi> This you ſay, and this we ſay; the only difference is, <hi>We do as we ſay,</hi> but <hi>You ſay and do not:</hi> You therefore muſt needs be in the Error in this caſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But let us hear what you have againſt our Doctrine. Firſt, you ſay, <hi>It oppoſeth the whole Current of Scripture, nullifies many Scripture-Promiſes and Privileges, and deſtroys the Covenant of Grace, as the premiſed Pages manifeſt.</hi> But I hope the premiſed Anſwers do manifeſt the Charge which you bring againſt our Doctrine to be very unjuſt. And ſeeing you are the Men, and not we, that have changed the Ordinance of Baptiſm, you may juſtly fear the Cenſure of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 5. <hi>for breaking the everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> See the Place, and conſider it ſeriouſly.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. You ſay, <hi>Our Doctrine introduceth the World into Gentiliſm or Heatheniſm, and makes Chriſt's Church always gathering, and never gathered.</hi> But how can you ſay this, ſeeing we are for the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diſcipling all Nations, and every Perſon in the Nations, as they are capable, and God gives his Miniſters opportunity; and we take the ſame way to do this which the Apoſtles uſed; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Ability; <hi>i. e.</hi> to preach the Goſpel to every one that will hear us, and to bring up our Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord? And what tho the Church be thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gathering, does not <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. warrant this Practice
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43526:44"/>
to the end of the World? and if you do not thus gather your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Chriſt, they will never be Chriſtians by your Croſſing and Sprinkling them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Your talk of excluding Infants from the Covenant, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before, and proved untrue; what you add, of our <hi>introducing of deſpair of the Salvation of Infants,</hi> ſhews your Self-contradiction. For now you ſeem to make Infant-Baptiſm ſo neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if they be not baptized, we muſt deſpair of their Salvation: Than which what can be a more erronious Conſequence of your Doctrine of <hi>Poedo-baptiſm?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. It is apparent that our Doctrine makes the Covenant eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Chriſt better than yours (whatever you ſay here to the contrary); not only becauſe we aſſert the Grace of God in the Buſineſs of Salvation to extend to Infants more generally than you do: But alſo for that it ſhews, God has not impoſed any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies upon them, as he did upon the Jewiſh Male Infants of eight days old. Whilſt your Doctrine makes your Croſſing and Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them of ſuch importance, as that if it be denied them, deſpair of the Salvation of Infants is <hi>genuinely introduced,</hi> pag. 74. As if God had tyed the Salvation of all the Infants in the World to a Ceremony. Thus does your Doctrine make the Covenant eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Chriſt, worſe than the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> for under it the greater part of the Infants of the Jews were ſaved, without being Circumciſed, to wit, all the Females, and all the Males under eight days old: But you have no hope for Infants Male or Female, tho but of a day old, if it be not ſealed with your pretended Baptiſm. <hi>Lord, whither will Men go when they forſake thy Word!</hi> They will make Chriſt an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> if Infants be not capable of Baptiſm: See Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 72. <hi>n.</hi> 5.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. You ſay, <hi>Our Doctrine equals the Children of Chriſtians with the Children of Turks, &amp;c.</hi> But we have ſhewed the advantage to be on the part of the Children of Chriſtians. And what if God, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to magnify his Mercy and Goodneſs, has provided a Saviour for the innocent Babes (dying in Infancy) throughout the World? What need this trouble any Body? muſt our Eye be Evil, becauſe his is thus Bountiful? We know that he hath concluded all under Sin, that he might have Mercy upon all. And if God hath not Mercy on poor dying Infants, ſo as to ſave them all by Chriſt, pray ſhew what Mercy he hath upon them? Sure it had been a Mercy they had never been born, but not one <hi>Iota</hi> of Mercy to be born,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43526:44"/>
only to cry, dye, and go to Hell. Can you think that ſuch Doctrine befriends the Covenant of Grace? I think not.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. To what you ſay (or have ſaid) about the Form of Baptiſm, you much miſtake us if you think we do not baptize in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. The Article of our Faith, which you point to, was not written (as I conceive) to teach any to diſpenſe Baptiſm in different Forms of Words, but to ſhew that the Name of Son is to be taken, <hi>as he is our Lord and Saviour.</hi> Yet let me tell you, that I can ſhew it under the Hand of ſome now in your Miniſtry, that ſays <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. does not impower any to uſe that Form of Words in Baptiſm, and ſhews alſo that the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are not agreed in that Matter.

                     </gap>, till he makes their Signification altogether uncertain, and ſets the Learned together by the Ears about the meaning of theſe Greek Words. And indeed, according to Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> no Man can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know when he hits right upon the thing to be done in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this Precept, <hi>Baptizing them.</hi> As if our Lord ſhould leave his Apoſtles, and they leave us to gueſs at his meaning; in a Paſſage wherein he commands nothing certainly. And yet to go round again, however we uſe Water in the Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we can hardly go beſides the meaning of Chriſt: For if we dip the Subject in the Element of Water, we are right; if we ſprinkle it upon any part of the Body, (for you can aſſign no one part more than the other) we are right ſtill; if we dip the Head only, or only the Foot, we are right; if the Head, or Breaſt, or Hand only be ſprinkled, ſtill we are right. Now who can think, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhould uſe an ambiguous Word, which is to guide us in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact? Do not Men that thus deal with the Word <hi>Baptize,</hi> make him the Author of all our Conteſts in this Caſe? And aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> has run many a one into a maze, about the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and I am ſorry to ſee Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> to follow him. But ſith he refers me alſo to Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s <hi>Crit. Sac.</hi> He ſhall do well to mark what he ſaith (even as quoted by Mr. <hi>Walker, p.</hi> 36.) the reaſon (ſays he) why <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is put <hi>pro Lotione &amp; mundatione,</hi> is, becauſe ſuch as are immerſed (that is, dipped) come <hi>out of the WATER</hi> waſhed or cleanſed.</p>
                  <p>So then, to Baptize, is to dip the Subject in the Element in the Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that which is no ſmall, but a moſt importent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of that Mode (and only that) is the Baptiſm of Chriſt's own Perſon; for Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> cannot deny, that the Greek in <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 9. being rightly rendred in Engliſh, is thus read; <hi>Jeſus came—and was baptized of John INTO JORDAN,</hi> and therefore he may be confident he was not ſprinkled, for it would be nonſence to ſay he was ſprinkled <hi>into Jordan;</hi> but good ſence and plain truth too, to ſay he was dipped <hi>into Jordan.</hi> And yet for all this, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> fights ſtoutly both againſt Truth and Reaſon, leaning
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43526:45"/>
only upon the ſingle Authority of <hi>Bernard,</hi> and will have Sprinkling to be meant or ſignified by the Word <hi>Baptize,</hi> as well as Dipping. And Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſays the ſame, tho many learned Writers contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict them both.</p>
                  <p>But it ſhall ſuffice here to ſet down two, both equal in Learning and Vertue to theſe our preſent Oppoſites. The firſt ſhall be that truly Famous Man, Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor,</hi> in his <hi>Rule of Conſcience, l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>If you would attend to the ſignification of the Word, BAPTISM ſignifies plunging in Water, or dipping with waſhing.</hi> And ſaith <hi>Kec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerman, Immerſion not Aſperſion</hi> (that is, dipping not ſprinkling) <hi>was the firſt inſtitution of Baptiſm, as it doth plainly appear from</hi> Rom. 6. 3. <hi>Syſt. Theol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for all this, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> pretends Antiquity for Sprinkling, and it is ſtrange to ſee what learned Men will ſay, when they are ſet to defend Error. We will but touch two of his moſt ancient Inſtances, that you may ſee the bottom of the buſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He goes as high as the ſecond Century, and takes an inſtance of ſprinkling from the ſervice of the <hi>Daemons</hi> (that is, Devil-Gods) but why ſo? Becauſe he ſuppoſes the Heathen uſed ſprinkling in the Service of their <hi>Daemons,</hi> in imitation of the Chriſtians Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. But the truth is, it's more to be feared, that unwary Chriſtians did fall to imitate the Heathens; for we are told ſo in effect, even by a learned Popiſh Author, which for the plainneſs of the Teſtimony, I will here faithfully tranſcribe. He ſaith, <hi>—This chief Chair of the Church being tranſlated from</hi> Antioch <hi>to</hi> Rome: <hi>He</hi> [Peter] <hi>and his Succeſſors, were very careful and vigilent to reduce the Chriſtian Religion (being as yet indigeſted, unpoliſhed, and little pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed) and the Profeſſors thereof, into better Order and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, out of the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>(which Chriſt came not to aboliſh, but to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil) out of the Civil and Politick Government of</hi> Romans, Greeks <hi>and</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and out of both ſacred and prophane Rites, Laws, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of other Nations, but moſt eſpecially by the wholſom Doctrine and Direction of Chriſt Jeſus, and the inſpiration of the Holy Spirit.</hi> See a Book called, <hi>The Manners, Laws and Cuſtoms of all Nations, pag.</hi> 151. Behold here the Springs of Human Inventions and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s ſecond Inſtance, is a Story of one ſprinkled with Sand, inſtead of Water (the Water being ſcarce, and the Party like to dye): but alas they could not dip the Sick into the Sand, and however their Zeal may be commended, their Action is not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43526:46"/>
to be commended at all: It ſhews their Folly, for it's better to be without a Ceremony, when we cannot poſſibly have it in God's way, than to ſet up our own Devices in the ſtead, and place, and uſe of it. <hi>For I will</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>have Mercy and not Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus we ſhall leave Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> to conſider his Sandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for his ſprinkling Infants.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſays, <hi>Sprinkling cannot nullify Baptiſm, and therefore our diſſenting Brethren are to blame, to make our Baptiſm to be eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted, and not to be accounted Baptiſm, becauſe not performed by Dipping.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer; When our Saviour commanded to baptize, he commanded but one, not divers kinds of Actions; and to do that, which is not only contrary to his own bleſſed Example in this very thing, but alſo ſuch an Act as cannot with any equity of Speech, or good Sence, be called Baptiſm, is to err eſſentially in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it. And ſo great is the difference between Dipping and Sprinkling, that ſuch as ſprinkle Infants dare not ſpeak as they act, when they pretend to baptize: No, they dare not ſay, I ſprinkle thee in the Name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they might well ſay, if the word Baptize does equally ſignify dipping and ſprinkling.</p>
                  <p>We are not therefore to blame, to labour to have this Ordinance kept as it was delivered, for ſure if it be our Duty to keep God's Ordinances, it's our Duty to keep them as they were obſerved by Chriſt, and the Primitive Churches. And ſo far as the manner of doing this command of Chriſt is eſſential to the Ordinance, dipping is of the eſſence of it, without which it cannot be called Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Again, All the Scriptures which command to baptize, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly command to dip the Party to be baptized, and therefore Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> is to blame, to ſay, <hi>There is not one place of Scripture which in expreſs Words commands Dipping,</hi> pag. 59. Yea, Sir, your Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. commands Dipping: For were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> tranſlated into plain Engliſh, it muſt be rendred by dipping. And I pray Sir, conſider, whether you could not with a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tranſlate it ſo? And on the other ſide, Whether your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would not accuſe you, ſhould you tranſlate the Text, Teach all Nations, ſprinkling them? I dare ſay no Man dare thus read the Text. Why then do they thus act? Shall we ſpeak one thing, and do another? <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do ye, as they that ſhall be judged by the Law of Liberty;</hi> to wit, the Goſpel.</p>

3. What you urge from the Legal Waſhings, has been anſwered by the Learned of our way, and particularly by Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> who ſays, <hi>I have carefully examined all the Places in the Old Teſtament, where the word</hi> Dipping <hi>or</hi> Baptizing <hi>is mentioned, and do find it is expreſſed by the Hebrew Word,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>as</hi> Minceus <hi>and Dr.</hi> Hammond <hi>obſerve. The Septuagint do render the Word</hi> Tabal <hi>in the Hebrew, by</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>and with all the Tranſlators, both the Latin, Dutch, Italian, French, and Engliſh, do tranſlate</hi> to dip; <hi>the Word rendred</hi> Waſhing, <hi>being another Word, as the following Scriptures inform you,</hi> Gen. 37. 31. Exod. 12. 22. Lev. 4. 6. &amp; 17. 14. &amp; 6. 16, 51. Levit. 9. 9. Deut. 33. 24. John 3. 5. Numb. 16. 18. 2 Kings 5. 14. I cannot think therefore, that you can conſcionably parallel <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11. with the Jewiſh Waſhings, which are expreſſed by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> further ſhews.) And ſure I am, that <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. is ſo very clear for our way of baptizing, that the Learned of your way do grant theſe Places allude to the ancient way of baptizing, which (ſay they) was by dipping the Party into the Water.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What you ſay of your Sprinkling to be as ſignificant as Dipping, is not true; for indeed unleſs it be commanded to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Death, Burial, Reſurrection of Chriſt, and our Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Vivification, it can ſignify none of theſe things. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe every time you waſh your hands, might ſignify what is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in your Baptiſm; yet you will not ſay it doth ſo. And the ſame Anſwer may ſerve to what you ſay, of Sprinkling and Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, being equally obliging; for unleſs God hath given them to oblige, they have no obliging Nature or Virtue in them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What you ſay of the Searcity of Water, can be no Plea for you that have no want of it, whatever it may be for them that have it not. But ſure, where God gives not Straw, he will require no Brick. He does not make Baptiſm ſo neceſſary, that we ſhall periſh if we cannot, but rather if we will not obey him therein.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Your Surmiſe, that Dipping ſeems an indecent thing, is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently ſaid, both by Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and your ſelf, ſeeing it may be done as decently as your Sprinkling; for your Talk of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Garments, ſhews your unacquaintedneſs with the right way of Baptizing. And know this, your ruffling Ladies in their gorgeous Apparel, may work upon your pravity of Heart ſooner, than to behold and humble penitent Sinner, cloathed in comely, tho mean Garments, to be buried with Chriſt by Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:43526:47"/>
7. To your Objection about the Coldneſs of the Climate, you need but put on the Garment of Love to God and his Truth, and act from a Principle of Faith, and you need fear no Ill, tho this Path may ſeem to you as the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Yet if any Perſon be really weak of Body, and cannot be ſatisfied to delay, (as I confeſs that may be dangerous) there may ſuch care be taken, as in the Eye of Reaſon no Inconvenience need be feared. And if the Water be frozen, (as you object) ſurely he that will allow us to thaw that for our natural, will not blame us, if we do ſo for our ſpiritual uſe.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Does plunging or dipping take away the Underſtanding? Why, not more now than in Chriſt's Time. And is it ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the Underſtanding act in the Duty? I marvel then why you baptize Perſons (as you call it) when they are aſleep.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. What you ſay of the great Labour of dipping, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility for one Man to baptize 3000 in one day, and that it is therefore unreaſonable to think the Apoſtles did dip all that they baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer; Firſt, you grant then, that they dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſome that they baptized; prove now that they ſprinkled ſo much as one, and the Diſpute is at an end. Secondly, But Sir, what need was there for one Man only to baptize the three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand? <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 40. Does not Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> himſelf ſuppoſe, that there were of the hundred and twenty Diſciples, eighty two in a Miniſterial Capacity, to wit, the Seventy two, beſides the Apoſtles? Surely they might eaſily baptize three thouſand in a few hours.</p>
                  <p>But you will now prove the Lawfulneſs and Reaſonableneſs of Sprinkling; let us hear what you ſay.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You now <hi>make Sprinkling not only equally ſignified in the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but to be more congruous with its genuine Signification; your reaſon is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> being a Derivative, can admit of no larger Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation than its Primitive <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which we find</hi> (ſay you) <hi>in the Hiſtory of</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>when like a Beaſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, he was wet with the Dew of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for Anſwer; 1. I ſay, this Place in <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. will never prove, that Sprinkling is more congruous to the genuine Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, than Dipping: For <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years to live with Beaſts, out of Habitation or Houſe, was ſufficiently waſhed, eſpecially being probably naked too; ſo that this kind of wetting holds ſome reſemblance with plunging in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43526:47"/>
Water, there being no part free from the Water thus rained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> In which reſpect, it ſeems, the Septuagint renders or expreſſes his lying open to the Snow, Hail, Rain, or Dew, ſo long a time, by the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And, 2. My Anſwer is, That the Greek here is <hi>Hyperbolical,</hi> and not properly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; and our Tranſlators knowing this, did not (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) tranſlate the Word according to its proper Signification, our Language not well bearing it in that caſe, but according to the thing which was to befall <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> And it ſeems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſingenuous, for you to conclude from this <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> that Sprinkling is <hi>more congruous</hi> to the ſignification of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, than Dipping, tho in ſo ſaying you contradict moſt of the Learned that have interpreted the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And I am ſure, (and you know it much better than I can tell you, for my Learning is nothing, when compared with yours,) that our Lexicons, Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and Grammars, do make the prime Signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>, to ſignify Sprinkling at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What you ſay in your <hi>2d, 3d, 4th,</hi> and <hi>5th.</hi> Particulars, is anſwered before; but here you ſay, <hi>The Church was never confined to that Mode of Dipping, but had ſeveral Ways of baptizing, dipping, or ſprinkling,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer: What Uſages the Church has had, is not the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; but the Ground of her doings is the matter of our Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But yet I will venture to ſay, ſhe was always confined to dip, if ſhe kept that Ordinance according to Chriſt's own Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which I think is a better Expoſitor of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, than any <hi>Lexicon</hi> in the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Alteration of the manner of this Ordinance, has not only occaſioned us to ſay, You that only croſs and ſprinkle are not baptized; but the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> declare the Latin Church to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized for the ſame reaſon. For this you may read <hi>Daille</hi> on the Fathers, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 148. where he tells us; <q>The Cuſtom of the Ancient Church was to plunge thoſe they baptized over Head and Ears in Water, as <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> teſtify. And this is ſtill the Practice of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Cnurch at this day, as <hi>Caſſander de Baptiſmo,</hi> pag. 193. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Cuſtom is now aboliſhed by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and this is the reaſon why the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> ſay that the <hi>Latines</hi> are not rightly and duly baptized.</q> Thus he. Nor is this the only
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43526:48"/>
Cauſe why we think your pretended Baptiſm a Nullity, for your Error about the Subject is more than the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What you ſay further is, to make us believe that Chriſt did not go into the Water; that the Eunuch went to the Water only, becauſe the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifies <hi>ad,</hi> to. But your Conſcience will tell you, it ſignifies <hi>into,</hi> as well as <hi>to;</hi> and indeed you grant it: and then to what putpoſe do you quarrel our Tranſlation? However, we have proved that Chriſt was baptized in the River: and 'tis expreſly ſaid of the many Thouſands which came to <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> that they <hi>were all baptized in the River, confeſſing their Sins.</hi> Now, Sir, here <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, cannot be rendred <hi>to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> nor <hi>with the River,</hi> (without egregious Folly) and then 'tis very plain, that they were all dipped in the River; for it had been abſolute Folly to go into the River to ſprinkle the Face, Hand, or any other part of the Body. Seeing then they went into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to baptize, it ſhews it cannot rightly be done without going into the Water: and therefore of neceſſity we muſt underſtand, <hi>Dipping</hi> is the only true Mode of <hi>Baptizing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. I marvel how any wiſe Man can look upon that Text, <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. John <hi>baptized in</hi> Enon, <hi>—becauſe there was much Water there,</hi> and ſo much as think Sprinkling to be a lawful way of baptizing. If he will uſe any of his Wit, he cannot but infer, Baptiſm could not be rightly done with a few drops of Water, ſeein <hi>John</hi> choſe <hi>Enon, becauſe there was much Water there.</hi> And what tho <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignify many Waters? yet it does not ſignify many Rivers; but by the Noiſe of many Waters, is often meant the Noiſe of much Water in one Source or Channel. However, you ſay, the Greek ſignifies the Confluence of theſe two Springs, <hi>Jordan</hi> and <hi>Jaboc;</hi> but yet you are unwilling that they ſhould yield ſo much Water as might ſuffice to dip in. And yet the Scripture tells you elſewhere, that <hi>Jordan</hi> overflows all her Banks at certain times; and <hi>Lithgow,</hi> that was at it, will give you an account, that it is a River ſufficient to dip a bigger Man than your ſelf in.</p>

                     <hi>But here,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is no mention of dipping.</hi> Yes, Sir, but there is; for when you hear, that <hi>John</hi> was baptizing in <hi>Enon,</hi> he was either <hi>dipping</hi> or <hi>ſprinkling.</hi> The latter would make the Speech abſurd and nonſenſical; the former therefore was his Buſineſs, for <hi>he was dipping in</hi> Enon, <hi>near</hi> Salem, <hi>becauſe there was much Water there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Church therefore is very much to blame, in leaving the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43526:48"/>
Way of Truth, and following her own Tradition, and is therefore the cauſe of our preſent diſunion, and will be till ſhe turn to the Truth, both in the Subject and Manner of Baptiſm, or at leaſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to impoſe upon us without Authority from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>What you add, by way of anſwer to ſome of our Objections againſt Infant Baptiſm, is anſwered in my Reply to Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> and Mr. <hi>J. Barret,</hi> which is bound up with my Book of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtianity,</hi> and to that I will refer you. What you add about Sureties or God-Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall not take notice of at this time, and indeed the uſage is ſo odd, that Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor</hi> well ſaid, if it had been God's will to have had them, <hi>It is to be ſuppoſed he would have given them Commiſſion to have tranſacted the Solemnity with better Circumſtances, and given Anſwers with more Truth; for if the God Fathers anſwer in the Name of the Child (I do believe) it is notorious, they ſpeak falſe and ridiculouſly.</hi> And this is even enough to ſay to ſuch an Innovation: But what abſurdity is it, which being once made a Cannon by learned Men, will not find ſome to daub it up with untempered Mortar? Could Men but remember <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Lev.</hi> 10. they would fear to add to, or take from the Ordinances of Chriſt, under what pretence of Piety or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſoever.</p>
                  <p>Thus Sir, I have briefly anſwered your Arguments, and hope I have not miſtaken your Sence in any Paſſage I except againſt. And for a Concluſion, I crave leave to ſay, That the way to obtain that Unity which is ſo deſirable, between the Baptized Believers and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is not to fall to it by Diſputation, but by propoſing what Abatements may be made about ſuch things as are not mentioned in the Scripture, (as this of <hi>Poedo-Baptiſm)</hi> is not) or at leaſt what mitigation may be hoped for, as to the impoſition of ſuch things: And on the other ſide, I truſt in the Lord that you ſhall call for nothing from us, wherein we may ſubmit without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God, but we ſhall gladly hearken to you.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, conſtant Prayer to God for the Bleſſing of Truth and Peace, and friendly conference between the leading Men on both parts, may do much to further ſo good a Work, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if his Majeſty would be graciouſly pleaſed to permit ſuch friendly Treaties. But of writing many Books there is no end.</p>

               <head>SECT. IV. <hi>A Plea for the Church-Aſſemblies of the Baptized Believers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MAny and very great has been the Sufferings of the Baptized Believers in this Nation, ſince the publication of the Act, entitled, <hi>an Act to prevent and ſuppreſs ſeditious Conventicles.</hi> And if the meaning of the ſaid Act be to reſtrict all Chriſtian Aſſemblies, (except the Parochial) to the number of four Perſons, beſides the Families where they do aſſemble, We ſee not how we can, with ſafety to our Souls, conform to the Limits thereby preſcribed. But foraſmuch as the ſaid Act pretends only the prevention and ſuppreſſion of Seditious Conventicles, We humbly conceive, that thoſe who are free from Seditious Deſigns in their meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to worſhip God, are rationally acquitted from the Imputation of Sedition; and conſequently no Man can conſcienciouſly proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any of us upon that Statute, being utterly unable to prove any ſuch Crime againſt us; nor could any ever yet convict us of ſuch an Evil, nor, by the Grace of God, ſhall they (I hope) ever be able to do it.</p>
               <p>Upon a due Enquiry it will evidently appear, that it is the Lord himſelf that hath ordered his People to convene or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, for the better diſcharge of the great Duties of Prayer, Preaching, and the Celebration of other his holy Ordinances; to which holy Ends he has allowed, not four Perſons only, but the whole Church, in any Town or City, to come together into one Place, among whom alſo ſuch as do not believe the Goſpel, are allowed to appear, in order to their Illumination, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any limitation in reſpect of Number: So that it ſeems to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the due Bounds of humane Power, to uſe Reſtraint, where God hath given ſuch gracious Liberty. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23, 24, 25. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 2, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch then as God has not given any Power upon Earth, to forbid any Chriſtian, or ſuch as deſire to know Chriſt, to hear his Word at any time, or in any place; but on the contrary, commands every Man that hath an Ear, <hi>to hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches,</hi> Rev. 2. 7. ſaying, <hi>To day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts,</hi> Pſal. 95. 7. Proclaiming <hi>to every one that thirſteth, to come and take of the Waters of Life freely:</hi> Iſa. 55. 1.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43526:49"/>
To whoſe gracious Invitation the <hi>Spirit and the Bride</hi> (the Church) agreeth, ſaying, <hi>Come,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. It muſt needs be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for any Man to ſay, <hi>Do not come,</hi> when they deſire to drink of theſe living Waters, which flow in the lively Preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt. And how can we think that our gracious God, who in Things pertaining to this Life, will not allow us to <hi>ſay to our Neighbour, Go away, and come again to morrow, and I will give, when we have it by us,</hi> Prov. 3. 27, 28. will ever accept us with a <hi>Well-done, good and faithful Servant,</hi> if in the more weighty Matters of his Law we put Men off with delatory Anſwers? <hi>Behold, now is the accepted Time; behold, now is the Day of Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be granted, that the Church is the Light of the World, a City ſet upon a Hill, that cannot be hid; whilſt therefore we are conſcionably, and (we truſt) groundedly perſuaded, that we are a part of this Church, a neceſſity lieth upon us, to <hi>make manifeſt the Savour of the Knowledg of Chriſt in every Place.</hi> For as it was truly ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>That no Man doth any thing in ſecret, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſires to be known openly:</hi> So neither muſt the Church of Chriſt obſcure her Light by a ſecret Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, leſt ſhe contradict her own Prayer, and the Practice of the Primitive Churches, held forth in theſe Words: <hi>God be merciful to us, and bleſs us, and cauſe his Face to ſhine upon us, that his Way may be known upon the Earth, and his Saving-Health among all Nations. And now, Lord, behold their Threatnings, and grant unto thy Servants, that with all boldneſs they may ſpeak thy Word.—And they ſpake the Word with boldneſs.—And they overcame him by the Blood of the Lamb, by the Word of their Teſtimony; and they loved not their Lives unto the Death.—And became Followers of the Churches of God, having received the Word in much Affliction, with Joy of the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if for the like faithful Teſtimony we muſt ſtill ſuffer, as we have done, we ſhall rejoyce, as Chriſt hath exhorted us. The Church is taught of God to hold faſt, not her Faith only, but alſo the Profeſſion of her Faith; and this not by Starts and Girds, as Men give them Licenſe or Toleration, but with all conſtancy, and without wavering. And ſurely our Lord foreſeeing, and by his Apoſtles foreſhewing what would come to paſs, required that this Profeſſion be held without wavering in the Buſineſs of Church-Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. becauſe without ſuch Aſſemblies, the whole Service of God (in a Church-way) is like to fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>This Duty, as it is of greateſt importance, ſo it is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Heavens Authority: <hi>Forſake not the Aſſembling of your ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:43526:50"/>
And it is granted by the learned Proteſtants, <hi>That againſt the Law of God or Nature no contrary Cuſtom doth ever prevail.</hi> [Dr. <hi>Field</hi> of the Church, lib. 4.] <hi>He that doth any thing by Command from the King, contrary to the Command of God, does not fear God,</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage,</hi> Chaplain to K. <hi>Charles</hi> II, in his <hi>Dew of Hermon, p.</hi> 36, to 39.) And, ſpeaking of the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, he ſaith, <hi>Their Rulers enjoined them not to preach Chriſt, and therein they did well to diſobey; for otherwiſe they had not feared God, inaſmuch as tho their Rulers were above them, yet God was above them both.—For in commanding any thing contrary to the Word and Will of God, they abuſe their Power, either through their Ignorance or Wilfulneſs; and in that caſe meerly Paſſive Obedience is to be yielded.</hi> Theſe latter Sentences are the more remarkable, being written by one of his Majeſties Chaplains, in Anſwer to a Book written by the Baptized Believers in this Age, entitled, <hi>Sion's Groans for her Diſtreſſed;</hi> which Book, whilſt he pretends to confute, he has confirmed it, in the main ſcope and Intent of it.</p>
               <p>As it is impoſſible, by Mulcts and Penalties to overcome the faithful Profeſſors of the Truth, <hi>(for that which is of God, Men cannot overthrow,</hi> Acts 5. 39.) ſo neither will thoſe that are zealous for Error, be vanquiſhed by that way. And the miſchief is, their Errors are by their Sufferings made the more taking with thoſe of weak Judgments. What then is the reſult of Perſecution for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Is it not commonly this, That the Hypocrites or Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers do fill that Church which has the Power of the Magiſtrate on her ſide? And ſuppoſe ſhe have the Truth on her ſide, yet thoſe Temporizers come not to her Communion for the Truths ſake, and therefore cannot be a Bleſſing to her, nor ſhe to them; nay, theſe ſhall, the ſooneſt of all others, betray her, when ever Time ſhall miniſter occaſion; for thoſe who are not true to God, and their own Conſcience, will never be faithful to Men. <hi>They wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip not the King of Heaven, but the Earthly Crown and Scepter, much like</hi> Euripus, <hi>carried headlong ſometimes this way, ſometimes that way.</hi> Socrat. lib. 3. cap. 21.</p>
               <p>But, ſhortly, to ſum up what is or might be further ſaid in this Caſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To reſtrict our Aſſemblies to the <hi>Limits</hi> of the ſaid Act, is to obey Man rather than God, who gives liberty, without limiting the Numbers of thoſe that meet, to worſhip him in a Church-way. And whilſt we believe our Aſſemblies are true Churches, we muſt endeavour to meet in God's way, whoever countermands it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:43526:50"/>
2. For thus to limit our Aſſemblies to the Number of Four; will certainly deſtroy all our Church-Aſſemblies: For, ſuppoſe ſome Congregation or Church conſiſt but of an hundred Perſons, theſe being divided into Fours, have no Church-Aſſembly, unleſs every of theſe four be a Church. And if the Magiſtrate have juſt power to divide us into Fours or Fives, he has power to ſubdivide us into Two's, and by conſequence to diſſolve all our Aſſemblies. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, a ſmall Number may conſtitute a true Church. <hi>Gregory Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturgus,</hi> tho a Biſhop, had a Church conſiſting but of ſeventeen Perſons. <hi>[Baſil. de Spirit. Sanct.</hi> cap. 29.] Our Saviour has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his preſence, where <hi>two or three are met together in his Name.</hi> But then <hi>in his Name,</hi> ſignifieth in his Authority, and according to his Appointment. Now Chriſt has no where appointed, that four, and no more, ſhould come together into one Houſe or Place; no, tho an hundred Perſons be come together, if more do come, they cannot be prohibited by all that Power which God has given to Man, as we have ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our zealous Country-Men of the Parochial Way, would think it very unlawful to be limited in their Meetings to fours or fives; and yet they ought to be reſtrain'd from Seditious Practices as well as others; and we do by as good Right think it unlawful for us to be ſo reſtrained. We hope our Legiſlators did not intend at all to exalt their Authority againſt the Lord, whoſe Power is above all. But yet when theſe Laws come to be executed upon good Men, by the Induſtry of mercenary Fellows, meerly for worſhipping God, then are they turned into Snares to the ruin of the Innocent, and diſhonour of that Power which gave them being. And all this falls out, for want of better proviſion in the ſaid <hi>Laws,</hi> to convict Men of Sedition, than only becauſe they were obſerv'd to preach or pray.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore, being fully ſatisfied that our Aſſemblies are true Church-Aſſemblies, and that upon the ſtricteſt enquiry we are able to make into the due Nature and Order of ſuch Aſſemblies, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves indiſpenſibly bound by the Word of God, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the firſt and beſt Churches, and the Tie of Conſcience, as regulated by a ſincere Love of Religion, to hold faſt the Profeſſion of our Faith without wavering or changing, by reaſon of the Change of Times, or Man's Laws. Being alſo rationally perſuaded, that the more publick and free Men are to ſerve the Lord, the leſs danger of Sedition. Wherefore, with innocent Hearts, and pure Hands, (as to any Deſign of Sedition) in the ſtrength of Chriſt, we will keep his Way, and let the Lord do with us as ſeemeth him good.</p>

               <head>SECT. V. <hi>Of the Baptized Believers Call to Chriſtianity, and to the Work of the Miniſtry.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHen our Saviour commanded his Apoſtles <hi>to teach all Nations,</hi> and to <hi>preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> We do not doubt but their performance <hi>of this his gracious Will,</hi> may truly be ſaid to be the <hi>calling of the Gentiles,</hi> or <hi>Nations:</hi> And that Men enjoy a great Mercy (for which they ought to be very thankful) to be born in a Nation to whom the Goſpel has been preached, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by their Progenitors: And that it is alſo a great Bleſſing to be born under the Government of Chriſtian Princes; and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we ought to love and honour our Nation, and the Rulers of it, upon this very account (as well as for the Obligation of Nature and Laws) <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they aſſert the Intereſt of Chriſt Jeſus in general as well as we.</p>
               <p>Nor is it our Buſineſs to deſtroy the State of Chriſtianity recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in any Nation; nor at all to deſpiſe the Miniſtry that conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly upholds it (but only to labour that Chriſtianity may be delivered from the Errors that have encumbred it, by reaſon of the change of Governments and Intereſts, or Corruptions of the Ages paſt.) And in this Conſideration, as we look upon our Nation to be a Chriſtian Nation; ſo we count our ſelves much more happy in being Members of a Nation that owns the true God, Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to be the Saviour of the World, the Scriptures to be holy and true, and that Faith and Holineſs is the way to true Bleſſedneſs, than to have been of any other Nation whatſoever.</p>
               <p>But yet for all this there is a great Truth in the Words of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> i. e. <hi>We are not born, but made Chriſtians.</hi> And therefore, we do not think that our meer Birth of Chriſtian Parents does qualify us, or give us an actual Right to Chriſt's Ordinances; but to this end we believe, and know, that every Perſon ought to have the Goſpel preached, or ſome way made known to them, and that a work of real Grace (or the new Birth) at leaſt by a ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, muſt precede our Baptiſmal Covenant; to this the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures give full conſent, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12, 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. And thus we, and ours (ſo many of them as the Lord our God does call by the preaching of the Goſpel) are actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43526:51"/>
with the Church of Chriſt Militant, and engaged thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth in the high and holy Calling, and actual Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But now, Whether we have any lawful Call to the work of the Miniſtry, is the buſineſs to be a little conſidered, partly, for that ſome of our late Perſecutors were pleaſed to ſuggeſt the contrary; and partly to put our ſelves upon the ſtricteſt Trial, even in this caſe where we are ſuppoſed to be the moſt deficient.</p>
               <p>The Queſtions in this caſe to be reſolved, are,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Whether a ſucceſſion of Ordination from Man to Man, down from ſome of the Apoſtles, be abſolutely neceſſary to a due Call to the Miniſtry?</hi> or,</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Whether the ſame Means that is of Authority ſufficient to make Men Chriſtians, be not alſo ſufficient to make Miniſters?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>In anſwer to theſe Queſtions, we ſhall do little more than offer what we have formerly written upon this Subject. And tho the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are the Men who ſtand moſt ſtifly for Succeſſion, as neceſſary, yet of late we find our Friends of the Church of <hi>England</hi> looking that way, as if they would juſtify their Ordination in a ſucceſſive Line from Man to Man, through the Papacy: which thing is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by Dr. <hi>Luther,</hi> with the greateſt vehemency, in theſe words. <q>Whoſo loveth Chriſt, ought to endure any thing, rather than to be ordained by the Papiſts; becauſe in their Ordinations all things are carried with ſuch wicked prepoſterouſneſs, that if they were not mad, and blind, they would perceive how they mock God to his Face;—being ſtricken with an univerſal blindneſs, they do not ſo much as know the Word of God, ſpecially the Biſhops who ordain.—Let me be counted a Fool, a Knave, a Lyer, if there be any one of them, ordain'd by them, who dare ſay, that at ſuch time as he received Orders, he was commanded to diſpenſe the Myſteries of Chriſt, or to teach the Goſpel, —but they ordain Sacrificers of the unbloody Sacrifice of the Maſs, and to hear Confeſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Thus far <hi>Luther.</hi> And the Oath which they take at their Ordination (as ſet down by Mr. <hi>Bullinger)</hi> is very un-goſpel-like, the ſum of it is in theſe Words, <hi>That the Prieſt will be a true Subject to the Pope, obey the Decrees of the Fathers, and of the Church</hi> (i. e. <hi>the Roman Church) and that he will perſecute Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beza</hi> cenſures all Ordination taken from the Papiſts. Let us hear him ſpeak. <q>What ordinary Vocation is that which you ſay the firſt Reformers had, excepting ſome few of them, is it not the Pall? Shall we think then, that the Popiſh Orders are valid, in which there is not any preceding enquiry into manners? No ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43526:52"/>
or Procedure, as is inviolably to be made, or obſerved, by Divine Right in Elections, and Ordinations,—Shall we think ſo highly of their Ordinations, that as often as any falſe Biſhops are converted to true Chriſtianity, immediately all the Filth, Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Impurity, collated, is waſhed away? Nay, but with what Face or Conſcience will he be able to forſake Popery, and not abjure his irregular Ordination? or if he do abjure it, how can he by virtue thereof claim Authority to teach?</q> 
               </p>
               <p>Thus theſe two Pillars of the Proteſtant Reformation, are ſo far from deriving their Call to the Miniſtry, through the Papacy (as ſome late Proteſtants pretend to do) that they do utterly reject any Ordination which comes from them. Nor was <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> ordained after they came from the Papiſts. (Mr. <hi>Stub</hi>'s <hi>Occaſ. Quaer.)</hi> But <hi>Beza</hi> is ſaid to defend his Call to the Miniſtry, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thoſe that were called extraordinarily, as <hi>Iſaiah, Daniel, Amos, Zecharias,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, we may aſſume, that either of theſe ways (as approved by our Reformers reſpectively) could we go to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our Call to the Miniſtry, as well as they: Being firſt, many of us, ordained by thoſe who received Ordination from you, and ſome may run with you to Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who was ordained by the Papacy; and then proceed, till we come up to <hi>Clemens,</hi> or <hi>Lucius,</hi> and ſo to St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the pretence of <hi>Beza,</hi> or <hi>Luther,</hi> about their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Call, it's not impoſſible for us to give as fair a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it, as either of them, (ſpecially if we take the Rules gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Mr. <hi>Beza,</hi> to judg of ſuch a Call by, to be cogent, <hi>viz. good Life, ſound Doctrine, and the Election of the People.)</hi> But to be plain, we do not very well like either of theſe ways. Not the firſt, it is ſo ſordid, as that the Papiſts themſelves in deriving their Call through the Papacy, are forced to take it from ſo many falſe pretended Popes, or Diabolical Popes, even Witches and Devils incarnate (by their own confeſſion) that they make but a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Succeſſion of it in the end. And eſpecially, if <hi>Stapleton</hi> may be regarded (tho a Papiſt) who tells us, <hi>That it is not a bare and perſonal Succeſſion, but lawful Succeſſion, which is a note of a true Church;</hi> and defineth that to be <hi>lawful Succeſſion, when not only the latter ſucceeds into the void rooms of thoſe that went before them, being lawfully called thereunto, but alſo hold the Faith which their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors did.</hi> Now let this Rule be honeſtly ſtood by, and we are ſure the Papiſts ſhall never be able to prove a Succeſſion of many points
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43526:52"/>
of their Faith, and Doctrines from the Apoſtles, whilſt the World ſtands, and conſequently neither can the Proteſtants derive a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Succeſſion from them.</p>
               <p>We like not the ſecond way, for we will not compare with <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah, Daniel, Amos,</hi> nor <hi>Zechariah,</hi> in reſpect of their immediate Miſſion. But this we ſay, That our Call to the Miniſtry is no otherwiſe extraordinary, than our Call to believe the Goſpel is ſo; or, as it ſtands clear from all the idle Ceremonies uſed by Papiſts, or others in their Ordinations, or as it is ordered (as near as we can) according to the Word of God. And is the ſacred Word of Power to beget us to God, and by the aſſiſtance of his Spirit to make us his Children, or Chriſtians? and is it not of Power or Authority ſufficient to enable us to worſhip God in his own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which were made for Chriſtians, and not Chriſtians for them? This ſeems juſtly ridiculous.</p>
               <p>We make no doubt but that it's eaſy with God (and no extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary thing) to raiſe a People to himſelf, in a Nation where all have corrupted the way of Chriſtianity, (or loſt the State and Praiſe of a true Church) meerly through his Bleſſing upon the reading and diligent ſearching of the Scriptures, (I ſpeak of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the Scriptures are received, as that is our caſe.) The Truth is, all the ways of God's Worſhip, are (in the Word) made ready for us, and laid at our Doors, and we do but take up glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what others let lie as uſeleſs things, that they may hug their own Devices.</p>
               <p>But now to ſilence a Papiſt for ever (which ſome will think to be a difficult undertaking); do they not allow (even by the Pen of the Learned <hi>Bellarmine, chap.</hi> 7.) that even an Heathen, that is not baptized, may adminiſter Baptiſm in caſe of Neceſſity? And this they eſteem a valid Baptiſm. And why then may not we, when God hath opened our Eyes to ſee any other Truth, as well as that, enter upon the dutiful obſervance of it in the beſt way we can, our Circumſtances (eſpecially the caſe of Neceſſity) being conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? For is not Neceſſity as good a Warrant to take up the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of, or to reſtore one Truth as well as another? Certainly, one Ordinance is as ſacred as another, and where Churches are ſetled, ought to be diſpenſed in the moſt honourable way, and by the moſt fit Inſtruments, even Chriſt's Miniſters. Wherefore, till the Papiſts ſhall recal their opinion about Baptiſm, and prove a Succeſſion as neceſſary to Baptiſm as Ordination, they can with
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43526:53"/>
no ſhew of reaſon, inſiſt upon the neceſſity of Ordination to be founded upon Succeſſion. But further,</p>
               <p>It's evident from the Scriptures, <hi>(Acts</hi> 13.) that a Succeſſion is not neceſſary to true Ordination; for tho the Apoſtles were yet living, it was not thought neceſſary that they ſhould impoſe Hands upon <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul:</hi> but this is done by gifted Men, or the Prophets that were in the Church at <hi>Antioch.</hi> The only queſtion here to be reſolved is, <hi>Whether this laying on of Hands was for Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</hi> The Papiſts do hold it was; ſome Proteſtants deny it; but ſome Proteſtants do affirm it. Mr. <hi>Churchman,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> tells out of <hi>Chryſoſtom, That tho</hi> Paul <hi>was an Apoſtle neither of Men, nor by Men, yet as for the Work to which he was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ask the ſaid Father</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and he will tell you,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That it was the Office of an Apoſtle, and that he was ordained an Apoſtle here, that he might preach the Goſpel with greater Pewer,—And certainly that he had not the Apoſtleſhip before, may be made manifeſt by that which followed after.</hi> But tho ſome Proteſtants doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this were <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ordination (tho the matter is clear of it ſelf) yet here is the Ordination of <hi>Barnabas</hi> without all queſtion; and then it is evident that there was an Interruption of Succeſſion in the caſe of Ordination, even in the Apoſtles Days, and therefore by no means to be held to be neceſſary in our Days, who are ſo far removed from the times of the Holy Apoſtles, that in vain do Men think to find a clear and undoubted Succeſſion, of any one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from them. Wherefore we may ſafely conclude, that where the Truth of the Goſpel is received, with the Gifts of God's Spirit (as that was the caſe at <hi>Antioch)</hi> there is a ſufficiency of Power on the Perſons ſo gifted, with the advice of the Church to ſend forth, or appoint Men to the work of the Miniſtry; altho 'tis true, this courſe is moſt warrantable in the caſe of neceſſity, and in no wiſe to be done in contempt or wilful neglect of that way, which is more ordinary and regular. Howbeit, to tye all Power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſo ſtrictly to the Perſons of Men ordained, by ſuch as were ordained by the Apoſtles themſelves, would in all likelihood throw the Power of Ordination out of the Church of God at this day; eſpecially if we ſtand upon the due Election and Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Perſons ſo claiming Succeſſion from the Apoſtles themſelves.</p>
               <p>And becauſe due Qualifications, and Election, is as neceſſary to a true Miniſter of Chriſt, as Ordination, ſeeing it's moſt certain, that unleſs God do firſt make Men Miniſters, it's impoſſible for the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43526:53"/>
Church (rightly) to make them Miniſters. We ſhall here add, That beſides his moral Vertues, and Spiritual Gifts, he that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly called to the Miniſtry, muſt firſt be a true Member of the Church, and choſen by a true Church to that ſacred Employment. And then we may boldly (yet modeſtly) ſuppoſe, that true Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (at leaſt in ſome part of it) is only found in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Baptized Believers at this day: For, where true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is not, Ordination cannot be regular. Again, due Election is found amongſt them, whilſt neglected both by Papiſts, and Prelatiſts. And further, the true Form and Order of Ordination is found in our Churches. The firſt is evident of it ſelf, <hi>No Baptiſm, no due Ordination;</hi> is a Truth without exception among all that own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. And for the ſecond, 'tis certain none are ordained to any Office in the Baptized Churches, till elected by the conſent of the Church, or the Major part, to whom they are to miniſter.</p>
               <p>And herein they follow the Footſteps of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. when one muſt be choſen in the room of <hi>Judas,</hi> the 120, which was the whole Aſſembly, allowed the choice of two: and good reaſon there is, that where all are equally concerned, they ſhould all be ſatisfied in the choice of ſuch, as to whom they commit the care and feeding of their Souls.</p>
               <p>When the ſeven Deacons were to be ordained, the whole Church is conſulted, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. and the Election made by them who knew the qualification of the Perſons.</p>
               <p>And as holy Scripture, ſo Antiquity ſtands with us in this caſe. The <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> writing their minds to the Church at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> concerning ſome that were to ſucceed other Biſhops, gives theſe Directions: <hi>If ſo be they ſhall ſeem to be worthy, and the People ſhall chuſe them.</hi> What Rules were to be obſerved in reſpect of their worthineſs for Miniſterial Employment, may be gathered from <hi>Clement, Epiſt. ad Corinth. Having</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>made trial of them by the Spirit, to be Biſhops and Deacons.</hi> And again, <hi>Others well approved of, ſhould ſucceed into the Office and Miniſtry, who therefore have been conſtituted,—by famous and diſcreet Men, with the good liking and conſent of all the Church,—and who withal, have of a long time had a good Teſtimony from all Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leo</hi> gives the ſame direction <hi>(Epiſt.</hi> 84. <hi>c.</hi> 5.) charging, <hi>That none be ordained againſt the Wills and Petitions of the People:</hi> And again, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 49. <hi>The Cuſtom was that he ſhould be choſen of all, that was to be over all, and wills, that the liking of the People and their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:43526:54"/>
                  <hi>be ſought: That in Ordinations, the Rules of the Apoſtles and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ought to be obſerved; that he that is to be over the Church, ſhould not only have the Allowance of the Faithful, but the Teſtimony alſo of them that are without.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> is as clear for us, <hi>(Ep. l.</hi> 1.) The People who full well and perfectly know the Life of him that is to be ordained Biſhop, are to be preſent, and to be choſen with their allowance, who know the Converſation of every one. And he brings <hi>Salinius</hi> (his Colleague) for Inſtance, who was choſen by the Voice of the whole Brotherhood, and the Judgment of the Biſhops which came together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Each Church ſtands free</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Bilſon,</hi> Perpet. Govern.) <hi>by God's Law to admit, maintain, and obey no Man as their Paſtor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their liking; and that the Peoples Election dependeth on humane Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and firſt Principles of humane Society and Aſſemblies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Field</hi> informs us, <hi>That this Right of the People hath been invaded many ways:</hi> 1. <hi>By great Perſonages and Magiſtrates.</hi> 2. <hi>When the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops grew to great Pomp, and the Clergy began to be enriched by Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Elections were, and to this day are made according to the Intereſts of the Rich and Strong, whilſt the People are not only deprived of, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ignorant, that any Right remains in them to chuſe their own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Paſtors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Privilege, tho loſt in moſt National Churches, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and maintained in the Baptized Churches, where none are elected Meſſengers, Biſhops, or Deacons, without the free Choice of the Brotherhood where ſuch Elections are made. And after ſuch Election of Perſons of known Integrity and competent Ability, we proceed to Ordination, with Faſting and Prayer, and the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands, according to the Scripture; <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 3. <hi>When they had faſted and prayed, they laid their Hands on them, and ſent them away.</hi> Thus for the Ordination of Meſſengers, (which after the manner of ſome are called Biſhops.) <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>And when they had ordained them Elders in every Church, and prayed with Faſting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.</hi> Acts 6. 5, 6. <hi>And they choſe</hi> Stephen, <hi>a Man full of Faith, and of the Holy-Ghoſt, and</hi> Philip, <hi>and</hi> Prochorus, <hi>and</hi> Nicanor, <hi>and</hi> Timon, <hi>and</hi> Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, <hi>and</hi> Nicholas, <hi>whom they ſet before the Apoſtles; and when they had prayed, they laid their Hands on them.</hi> Thus for the Ordination of Deacons. All which Apoſtolical Practices are religiouſly reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and obſerved in the Churches of the Baptized Believers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any deviſed Adjuncts of our own or others. By all which it may
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43526:54"/>
appear, they have a lawful Call to the Work of the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Here I meet with an Objection; <hi>'Tis doubted by ſome, whether a Man having received Ordination as a Presbyter, may afterward have Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination as a Meſſenger of the Churches of Chriſt, the Objector ſuppoſing that the firſt Ordination is ſufficient, only the Church muſt give him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commiſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Objection I anſwer three ways: 1. By Antiquity. 2. By Reaſon. 3. By Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Antiquity is directly againſt this Objection, being rather for a threefold Ordination than only one, as I ſhall ſhew by and by. But firſt, I marvel how the Objector would give a Man a Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Commiſſion without Ordination, the Church having no other way at all to give Commiſſions but by Ordination; nor can any Man tell us, how ſhe can give her Commiſſions Miniſterial, but by the very Act of her Ordination; and according to the Nature of her Ordination, ſuch, and no other is her Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Now our Ancients underſtood this, and therefore did uſually bring Men gradually to the degree of a Biſhop, <hi>(i. e.</hi> a Meſſenger, according to the Scripture, Biſhop, or Overſeer, being a Name common to Elders in the Primitive Times.) Thus <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Socrat.</hi> l 6 c. 12, 13.</note> firſt ordained a Deacon, then a Presbyter, after that he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And ſaith the learned <hi>Bilſon, In the Primitive Church they were firſt Deacons, and upon Trial, when they had miniſtred well, and were found blameleſs, they were admitted to be Elders; and after that, if their Gifts and Pains ſo deſerved, they were called to an higher degree: ſo that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, by the ancient Diſcipline of Chriſt's Church, before he could come from miniſtring to governing in the Church of God, received thrice, or at leaſt twice, Impoſition of Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Reaſon tells us, that every Man that is called to the Work of the Miniſtry, ought to have a Commiſſion (that is, an Ordination) commenſurable to his Miniſtry. It is Chriſt's peculiar to give Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by the Word of his Mouth only, the Church cannot do ſo; ſhe muſt confer Miniſterial Authority in ſome ſolemn Rite or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. This is plain in the caſe of <hi>Deacons,</hi> it was not ſufficient for the Apoſtles to ſay (of Perſons eminently qualified) we order or appoint them to ſerve Tables, or, look ye to the Poor: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their great Qualifications and Election, they muſt receive their Commiſſion or Authority by Prayer, with the laying on of hands, elſe they have no Commiſſion. In like <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43526:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſolemnly ordained, before the Holy-Ghoſt hath made him an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer of the particular Flock committed to his Charge. And then in reaſon, if he have a far greater Charge afterward committed to him, he has need of a Commiſſion (that is, an Ordination, for other Commiſſion there is none) to enable him to take care of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches, and to plant new Churches in the World. We read not of any Meſſengers, that acted as ſuch in that great Truſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Ordination agreeable to their Work; and it is ill venturing to ſend Men out with a Commiſſion too ſhort for their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it being irrational ſo to do, and without any good Example. Let us ſee then what the Scripture will ſay in favour of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apoſtles had a twofold Apoſtleſhip; the one limited to the Jewiſh Nation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. the other of extent to all Nations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. If they were ordained to either, then they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to both; and the latter ſeems to be the more ſolemn and formal Ordination, not only for that when Chriſt had given them Order what to do, he <hi>lift up his Hands, and bleſſed them, Luk.</hi> 24. 50. but alſo gave them Order to tarry at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> until they were <hi>endowed with Power from on high.</hi> When their Work was <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> or limited, they had a limited Commiſſion; when their Work was <hi>univerſal,</hi> they had an univerſal Commiſſion. Sure the Church, who hath no way to give Commiſſions but by Ordination, ſhall do well and wiſely to follow Chriſt, the Author of all her Power, when ſhe delegates or gives it forth to any of her Miniſters. This Anſwer may ſuffice, yet we add:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barnabas</hi> is confeſſed to have been one of the Seventy Diſciples, and had a divine Authority from Chriſt to preach the Goſpel to the Jews; but when he is ſent to preach to the Gentiles, he hath a new Commiſſion, even an Ordination, as appears, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.</p>
