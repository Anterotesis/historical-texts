         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">That the Soul of Man is immortall, or dyeth not.</head>
            <p>HItherto I have treated of the world that is to be conceived
in underſtanding, and of the ſenſible World (as the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſts</hi>
tearm them) that is to ſay, of God and of this
World. Now followeth the examining of the little World (as they
terme it) that is to ſay, of man. Concerning God, we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
him to be a Spirit: and as touching the world we have
found it to be a body. In man we have an abridgement of both,
namely of God in reſpect of ſpirit,<note place="margin">Man is both Soul and body.</note> and of the world in compoſition
of body as though the Creator of purpoſe to ſet forth a mirrour of
his works, intended to bring into one little compaſſe both the <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſſe
of his own nature,</hi> and alſo the <hi>hugeneſſe</hi> of the <hi>whole world</hi>
together. We ſee in mans body a wonderfull mixture of the foure
Elements, the veyns ſpreading forth like Rivers to the uttermoſt
members; as many inſtruments of ſenſe, as there be ſenſible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in the world, a great number of ſinews, fleſh-ſtrings and
knitters; a head by ſpeciall priviledge directed up to Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and hands ſerving to all manner of ſervices. Whatſoever he is
that ſhall conſider no more but onely this inſtrument, without life,
without ſenſe and without moving; cannot but thinke verily that
it is made to very great purpoſe; and he muſt needs cry out as
<hi>Hermes</hi> or as the <hi>Sarzin Ab<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ala</hi> doth, that man is a miracle which
far ſurmounteth, not onely theſe lower Elements, but alſo the
very Heaven and all the ornaments thereof. But if he could (as it
were out of himſelfe) behold this body receiving life, and entering
into the uſe of all his motions with ſuch forwardneſſe, hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirring
themſelves ſo nimbly, and after ſo ſundry faſhions, and the
Senſes uttering their force ſo far off, without ſtirring out of their
place: thinke you not that he would be wonderfully raviſhed, and
ſo much more wonder at the ſaid life, moving and ſenſe, than at
the body, as he wondered afore at the body, to behold the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of the proportion thereof above the maſſe of ſome ſtone? For
what compariſon is there betweene a <hi>Lute and a Lute-player,</hi> or
between a dumbe inſtrument, and him that maketh it to ſound?
What would hee ſay then if he could afterward ſee how the ſame
man being now quickned attaineth in one moment from the one
ſide of the earth to the other, <hi>without ſhifting of place; deſcending</hi>
downe to the <hi>centre,</hi> of the world, and <hi>mounting</hi> up above the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt

circle of it both at once; preſent <hi>in a thouſand places at one</hi>
inſtant, imbracing the whole <hi>without touching it; keeping</hi> upon
the earth, and <hi>yet containing</hi> it; beholding the Heavens from <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,</hi>
and being <hi>above the Heaven of Heavens, both at once?</hi>
Should he not bee compelled to ſay, that in this ſilly body there
dwelleth a greater thing then the body, greater then the earth, yea
greater then the whole world together? Then let us ſay with <hi>Plato,</hi>
that man is double, outward, and inward. The outward man is
that which we ſee with our eys, which forgoeth not his ſhape when
it is dead, no more then a Lute forgoeth his ſhape when the Lute-player
ceaſeth from making it to ſound howbeit that both life, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
ſenſe, and reaſon be out of it. The inward man is the <hi>Soule,</hi>
and that is <hi>properly</hi> the <hi>very man,</hi> which uſeth the body as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument;
whereunto though it be united by the power of God, yet
doth it not remove when the body runneth. It ſeeth when the eyes
be ſhut, and ſomtimes <hi>ſeeth not</hi> when the eyes be wide open: It
<hi>travelleth</hi> while the body <hi>reſteth,</hi> and <hi>reſteth</hi> when the body <hi>travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,</hi>
that is to ſay, it is able of it ſelfe to performe his own actions,
without the help of the outward man, whereas on the contrary part
the outward without the help of the inward, that is to wit, the body
without the preſence of the Soule, hath neither ſenſe, moving, life,
no, nor continuance of being. In the outward man we have a
Counterfet of the whole world, and if you rip them both up by
piecemeale, ye ſhall finde a wonderfull agreement betwixt them.
But my purpoſe in this book is not to treat of the things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
peculiarly to the body.</p>
            <p>In the inward man wee have a ſumme of whatſoever life ſence
and moving is in all creatures, and moreover an Image or rather
a ſhadow (for the Image is defaced by our ſinne) of the Godhead
it ſelf. And that is the thing which wee have to examine in this
Chapter. In Plants, we perceive that beſides their bodies which
wee ſee, there is alſo an inward vertue which we ſee not, whereby
they live, grow, bud, and beare fruit: which vertue wee call the
quickening Soule, and it maketh them to differ from Stones and
Metalls, which have it not. In ſenſitive living things, we finde
the ſelfeſame vertue, which worketh while they ſleep and are after a
ſort as the Plants; and there withall we finde another certaine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or power which ſeeth, heareth, ſmelleth, taſteth, and feeleth;
which alſo in many of them doth <hi>hoord</hi> up the things brought in by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113444:5"/>
the ſences; which manner of power the Plants are void of. This do
we terme the ſenſitive Soule, becauſe the effects thereof are diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and executed by the Sences.<note place="margin">In Man are three abilities of Soule.</note> In man we have both the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and the Senſitiue, the former uttering it ſelf in the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and increaſing of him, and the latter in the ſubtility of ſence and
imagination, where through he is both Plant and Beaſt together.
But yet moreover wee ſee alſo a Mind which conſidereth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth,
which reapeth profit of the things that are brought in by
the Sences, which by his <hi>ſeeing</hi> conceiveth that which it <hi>ſeeth not;</hi>
which of that which <hi>is not,</hi> gathereth that which <hi>is;</hi> &amp; finally which
pulleth a man away both from earth and from all ſenſible things,
yea and (after a ſort) from himſelf too. This doe we call the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Soule, and it is the thing that maketh man to bee <hi>man,</hi> (and
not a Plant or a brute Beaſt as the other two do,) and alſo to be
the Image or rather a ſhadow of the Godhead, in that (as we ſhall
ſay hereafter) it is a Spirit that may have continuance of being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
by it ſelfe without the bodie. And by the way, whereas I ſay
that the inward man hath a quickening power as a Plant hath, a
ſenſitiue power as a Beaſt hath, and a power of underſtanding
wherby he is a man: my meaning is not that he hath three Soules
but onely one Soule; that is to wit, that like as in the brute Beaſt
the ſenſitive Soule comprehendeth the quickening Soule; ſo in
man the reaſonable Soule comprehendeth both the ſenſitive and
the quickening, and executeth the offices of them all three, ſo as it
both liveth, feeleth, and reaſoneth even as well and after the ſame
manner, as the mind of a man may intend to his own houſehold-matters,
to the affaires of the Commonweale, and to heavenly
things all at once. Or to ſpeake more fitly, theſe three degrees of
Soules are <hi>three degrees of life,</hi> whereof the ſecond exceedeth and
conteineth the firſt, and the third exceedeth and conteineth both
the other two. The one, without the which the bodie cannot live,
is the Soule or life of the Plant, and is ſo tied to the bodie, that it
ſheweth not it ſelfe in any wiſe out of it. The ſecond, which cannot
live without the bodie, is the Soule or life of the Beaſt, which doth
well utter forth his power and force abroad, but yet not otherwiſe
then by the members and inſtruments of the body whereunto it
is tyed. The third, which can of it ſelfe live and continue vvithout
the body, but not the body vvithout it, is the ſoule of man vvhich
giveth life inwardly to all his parts, ſheweth forth his life abroad
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113444:6"/>
in the perceiving of all things ſubject to ſence, and retaineth ſtill
his force (as ſhall be ſaid hereafter) yea and increaſeth it, even when
the ſtrength of the body and the very livelineſſe of the ſences fail.
And in very deed, you ſhall ſee a man forgoe all his ſences one after
another as the inſtruments of them decay, and yet have ſtill both
life and reaſon <hi>unappaired.</hi> The cauſe whereof is, that ſome of the
inſtruments of life and ſenſe doe faile, but the life it ſelfe vvhich
quickneth them fayleth not. And therefore the Beaſt forgoeth not
life in loſing ſenſe, but hee utterly forgoeth ſence in forgoing life.
And that is becauſe life is the ground of the abilities of ſenſe, and
the ſenſitive life is a more excellent life than the quickning life, as
wherein thoſe powers and abilities are as in their <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oot.</hi> To be
ſhort, he that bereaveth man or beaſt of the uſe of ſences, or man
of the right uſe of reaſon, doth not thereby bereave him of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
he that bereaveth the beaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the outward man of their life, doth
therewithall bereave them of ſence and reaſon. Therefore it is a
moſt ſure argument, that the ſoule which cauſeth a beaſt to live,
and the ſoule that cauſeth it to have ſence, are both one, that is to
wit, one certain kind of life more lively and more excellent than
the life that is in Plants. And likewiſe that the ſoule vvhich cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
man to live, to have ſence, and to reaſon, is but one, that is to
vvit, one certain kinde of life more excellent, more lively, and of
further reach, than the life of the Beaſt. But like as ſence is as it
vvere the forme or <hi>Selfebeing</hi> (if I may ſo terme it) of the life of a
beaſt; ſo is <hi>reaſon</hi> or underſtanding the very forme and <hi>Selfebeing</hi>
of the ſoule of man; and (to ſpeak properly) it is the ſoule or life
of the ſoule, life as the <hi>apple</hi> of our eye is the very <hi>eye of our eye.</hi>
And in very deed, vvhen the minde is earneſtly occupied, the ſences
are at a ſtay; and vvhen the ſences are overbuſied, the nouriſhment
and digeſtion is hindered, and contrariwiſe: vvhich thing could not
come to paſſe if the ſoule vvere any more than one ſubſtance, vvhich
by reaſon that it is but one, cannot utter his force alike in all places
at once, but yeeldeth the leſſe care one vvhere ſo long as it is ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
occupyed anotherwhere. In this ſoule of man (vvhich yet
notwithſtanding is but one) the diverſity of the powers and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
is very apparant. The quickning power doth nouriſh, increaſe
and mayntaine us; and Reaſon and Sence meddle not therewith,
neyther have they power to impeach the working thereof. The
truth whereof appeareth in this, that thoſe things are beſt done
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113444:6"/>
when our mind is at reſt, and our ſences are aſleep; inſomuch that
oftentimes we forg'd the ſence and moving of ſome parts by ſome
Rheume or ſome Palſey, and yet the ſame parts ceaſſe not to be
nouriſhed ſtill. Alſo, the ſenſitive life ſeeth and perceiveth a far off,
yea oftentimes without ſetting of the mind thereupon, or without
conſidering what the Sence conceiveth. Some men which have but
weak Sences, have very quicke underſtanding; and likewiſe on
the contrary part. Againe, ſome fall into a Conſumption, which
want not the perfect uſe of their Sences. Sometime the reaſonable
part is ſo earneſtly bent and occupied about the things that it liketh
of, that by the increaſing of it ſelfe, it hurteth and diminiſheth
the part that quickneth. Alſo it ſtandeth in argument againſt the
Sences, and reproveth them of falſhood, and concludeth contrary
to their information. And it may be that the man which hath his
digeſtion perfect and his Sences ſound, hath not his wit or reaſon
ſound in like caſe. Now, were the Soule but onely one ability, it
could not be ſo. But now is the ſame divided manifeſtly into wit or
underſtanding, and will; the one ſerving to deviſe, and the other to
execute. For we underſtand divers things which wee will not, and
wee will divers things which we underſtand not: which contrary
operations cannot be attributed both to one power. Nevertheleſſe,
the uniting of all theſe powers together is with ſuch diſtinctneſſe,
and the diſtinguiſhing of them is with ſuch union, that ordinarily
they meet altogether in one ſelf-ſame action, the one of them as
readily (by all likelihood) as the other, howbeit that every of them
doth his own work ſeverally by himſelfe, and one afore another as
in reſpect of their objects.</p>
            <p>Thus have we three ſorts of men, according to the three powers
or abilities of the inward man. Namely, the earthly man, which
like the Plant mindeth nothing but ſleeping and feeding, making
all his ſenſes and all his reaſon to ſerve to that purpoſe, as in whom
the care of this preſent life onely, hath devoured and ſwallowed up
his ſences and underſtanding. The Senſuall man (as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
himſelfe termeth him) who is given wholly to theſe ſenſible things
<hi>imbacing</hi> and caſting down his reaſon ſo far, as to make it a
<hi>bond-ſlave</hi> to his ſences and the pleaſures and delights thereof: And
the <hi>reaſonable</hi> man, <hi>who liveth properly in ſpirit and minde,</hi> who
<hi>intereth into himſelfe to know himſelfe, and goeth out of himſelfe
to behold God;</hi> making this life to ſerve to the attainment of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113444:7"/>
and uſing his Sences but as inſtruments and ſervants of his
reaſon. After as any of theſe three powers doe reigne and beare
ſway in man, that is to wit, after as a man yeeldeth himſelfe more
to one than to another of them; ſo becommeth he like unto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
the brute Beaſts, or Plants, yea and the very Blocks and
Stones. But it is our diſpoſition even by kind, to be carried away
by our corrupt nature, and by the obiects which hemme us in on all
ſides; but as for againſt our nature yea or beyond our nature, our
nature is not able to do any thing at all.</p>
            <p>Now, it is not enough for us to know that wee have a ſoule
whereby wee live, feele, and underſtand, and which being but one
hath in it ſelfe alone ſo many ſundry powers or abilities: for it will
be demanded of us by and by what this ſoule properly is. And
ſoothly if I ſhould ſay, I cannot tell what it is, I ſhould not belye
my ſelfe a whit; for I ſhould but confeſſe mine own ignorance, as
many great learned men have done afore me. And I ſhould doe no
wrong at all to the Soule it ſelf; for ſith we cannot deny the effects
thereof, the leſſe that wee be able to declare the nature and being
thereof, the more doth the excellency thereof ſhine forth. Againe,
it is a plaine caſe, that no thing can comprehend the thing that is
greater than it ſelfe. <hi>Now, our Soule is after a ſort leſſe than it
ſelfe, in as much as it is wrapped up in this body, in likewiſe as the
man that hath gyves and fetters on his feet, is after a ſort weaker
than himſelfe.</hi> Nevertheleſſe, let us aſſay to ſatisfie ſuch demands
as well as wee can. And for as much as it is the Image of God, not
only in reſpect of the government and mayntenance of the whole
World, but alſo even in the very nature thereof: as we ſaid here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
when we ſpake of the nature of God, if we cannot expreſſe
or conceive what it is, let us at leaſtwiſe be certified what it is not.
Firſt of all,<note place="margin">The body and the ſoul be not one ſelf-ſame thing.</note> that the Soule and the Body bee not both one thing,
but two very far differing things, and alſo that the ſoule is no
part of the body, it appeareth of it ſelfe without further proof. For
if the ſoule were the body, or a part of the body, it ſhould grow
with the body, as the other parts of the body doe, and the greater
that the body were,, the greater alſo ſhould the ſoule be. Nay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
wiſe, the body increaſeth to a certain age and then ſtayeth;
after which age is commonly the time that the Soule doth <hi>moſt
grow,</hi> and thoſe that are <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> of minde are commonly <hi>weakeſt</hi>
of body, and the Soule is ſeen to be full of livelineſſe in a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113444:7"/>
body, and to grow the more in force, by the decay of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
The Soule then groweth not with the body, and therefore it
is not the body, nor any part of the body. And whereas I ſpeak
of growing in the ſoule, by growing I mean the profiting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in power and vertue, as the body groweth in greatneſſe by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inlarging. Again, if the Soule were the body it ſhould loſe
her ſtrength and ſoundneſſe with the body ſo as the maimed in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſhould therewith feele alſo a mayme in his underſtanding, as
well as in his members: whoſoever were ſick of any diſeaſe, ſhould
alſo be ſick in his reaſon; he that limpeth or halteth, ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>halt</hi> in ſoule alſo: the blinde mans ſoule ſhould bee <hi>blinde,</hi>
and the lame mans ſoule ſhould be <hi>lame.</hi> But we ſee contrariwiſe,
that the maymed and the ſick, the cripples and the blinde, have
their ſoules whole and ſound, and their underſtanding perfect and
cleer-ſighted in itſelfe. To be ſhort, many a man dyeth whoſe body
is ſound, and differeth not a whit in any part from that it was
when it was alive, and yet notwithſtanding, both life, moving,
ſenſe, and underſtanding are out of it. <hi>Let us ſay then that in the
body there was a thing which was not of the body, but was a far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing than the body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some wilfull perſon will object here, that the force and ſtrength
of the ſoule groweth with the body, as appeareth in this that a
man grown will remove that which a child cannot, and that a child
of two years old will goe, which thing a babe of two moneths old
cannot doe. But he ſhould conſider alſo, that if the ſelfeſame man or
the ſelfeſame child ſhould have a miſchance in his leg or in his
arme, he ſhould thereby forgoe the ſtrength and moving thereof,
whereas yet notwithſtanding his ſoule ſhould have her former
force and power ſtill to move the other as ſhee did afore. Therefore
it is to be ſaid, not that the childs ſoul is grown or ſtrengthened
by time; but rather that his ſinews are dryed and hardened which
the ſoule uſeth as ſtrings and inſtruments to move withall and
therefore when age hath looſened and weakned them, a man hath
need of a ſtaffe to help them with, although he have as good a will
to run as he had when he was young. The ſoule then which moveth
them all at one beck, hath the ſelfeſame power in infancie which
it hath in age, and the ſame in age which it hath in the prime of
youth: and the fault is onely in the inſtrument, which is unable to
execute the operations thereof: like as the <hi>cunning of a Lute-player</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:113444:8"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:113444:9"/>
is not diminiſhed by the moiſtneſſe or ſlackneſſe of the Luteſtrings,
nor increaſed by the over high ſtraining and tight ſtanding of
them; but indeed in the one he cannot ſhew his cunning at all,
and in the other he may ſhew it more or leſſe. Likewiſe the ſpeech
of children commeth with their teeth, howbeit that the ſpeech doe
manifeſtly utter it ſelfe firſt, in that they prattle many things which
they cannot pronounce: and in old men it goeth away again with
their teeth, and yet their eloquence is not abated thereby. As for
<hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> although hee ſurmounted all the Orators of his
time, yet were there ſome letters which he could not pronounce.
Give unto old age or unto infancie the ſame ſinews and teeth,
and as able and luſty limbs and members as youth hath; and
the actions which the ſoule doth with the body and by the body, I
meane ſo farre forth as concerne the abilities of ſence and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes,
ſhall be performed as well in one age as in another. But had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
thou as great indifferencie in iudging of the force and power
of thyne owne ſoule, as of the cunning of a Lute-player, (I ſay not
by the nimblenes of his fingers which are perchance knotted
with the gout, but by the playne and <hi>ſweet Harmonie of his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatorie</hi>
as they terme it, which maketh thee to deeme him to have
cunning in his head, although hee can no more utter it with his
hands,) ſo as thou wouldeſt conſider how thou haſt in thy ſelfe a
deſire to go, though thy feet be not able to beare thee; a diſcretion
to iudge of things that are ſpoken; though thyne eyes cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
it unto thee; a ſound eloquence, though for vvant of thy teech
thou cannot vvell expreſſe it; and vvhich is above all the reſt, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
quicke and heavenly reaſon, even vvhen thy body is moſt
earthly and drooping. Thou vvouldeſt ſoone conclude that the force
and power of quickning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moving, and perceiving, is vvhole and
ſound in thy ſoule, and that the default is altogether in thy body.
Inſomuch that if ſhe had a nevv body and nevv inſtruments given
unto her, ſhe vvould be as luſty and cheerely as ever ſhe vvas, and
that the more ſhe perceiveth the body to decay, the more ſhe labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to <hi>retire into her ſelf</hi> vvhich is a plaine proofe of that ſhe is not
the body nor any part of the body, but the very life and <hi>in worker</hi> of
the body.</p>
            <p>And ſith it is ſo,<note place="margin">That the Soul is a ſubſtance.</note> there needeth no long ſcanning vvhether the
ſoul be a ſubſtance or a qualitie. For, ſeeing that qualities have no
being but in another thing than themſelves; the life vvhich cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113444:9"/>
another thing to be, cannot be a qualitie. Foraſmuch then as
the Soul maketh a man to be a man; who otherwiſe ſhould be but a
carcaſſe or carion: doubtleſſe (unleſſe we will ſay that the onely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
which is betwixt a man and a dead carcaſſe, is but in acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents)
we muſt needs grant that the ſoule is a forming ſubſtance and
a ſubſtantiall forme, yea and a moſt excellent ſubſtance infinitely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the outward man, as which by the power and vertue thereof
cauſeth another thing to have being, and perfecteth the bodily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which ſeemeth outwardly to have ſo many perfections.</p>
            <p>But hereupon inſeweth another controverſie, whether this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
be a bodily or an unbodily ſubſtance: which cauſe requireth
ſomewhat longer examination. Soothly, if we conſider the nature
of a body, it hath certain meaſurings, and comprehendeth not any
thing which is not proportioned according to the greatneſſe and
capacity thereof. For, like as it ſelfe muſt be fain to have a place
in another thing; ſo muſt other things occupie ſome certain place
in it, by reaſon whereof it commeth to paſſe, that things can have
no place therein if they be greater then it, without annoying the one
the other. To be ſhort, if the thing be leſſe than the body that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
it, the whole body ſhall not contain it, but onely ſome part
thereof: And if it be greater, then muſt ſome part thereof needs be
out of it:<note place="margin">Bodileſſe.</note> for there is no meaſuring of bodies but by quantity. Now
we ſee how our ſoule <hi>comprehendeth</hi> heaven and earth, without
annoying either other; and likewiſe, time paſt, preſent, and to come,
without <hi>troubling</hi> one annother; and finally innumerable places,
perſons and towns, without <hi>cumbering</hi> of our underſtanding.
The great things are there in their full greatneſſe, and the ſmall
things in their <hi>uttermoſt ſmallneſſe,</hi> both of them whole and ſound,
in the ſoule whole and ſound, and not by piecemeale or onely but
in part of it. Moreover, the fuller it is, the more it is able to receive,
the more things that are couched in it, the more it ſtill coveteth; and
the <hi>greater</hi> the things be, the fitter is ſhee to receive them even
when they be at the greateſt. It followeth therefore that the ſoule
(which after a ſort is infinite) cannot be a body. And ſo much the
leſſe can it ſo be, for that whereas it harboreth ſo <hi>many</hi> and ſo <hi>great</hi>
things in it, it ſelfe is lodged in ſo ſmall a body. Again, as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
divers places are in the ſoule or minde without occupying
any place; ſo is the minde in a thouſand places without <hi>changing</hi>
of place; and that ere whiles not by ſucceſſion of time, nor by turns,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113444:10"/>
but oftentimes altogether at one <hi>inſtant. Bid thy Soule or Mind
goe to</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>and forthwith to turne backe againe to</hi>
Rome, <hi>and ſtraight way to be at</hi> Paris or Lyons: <hi>Bid it paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
Amercia, <hi>or to goe about</hi> Affricke; <hi>and it diſpatcheth all theſe
iourneys at a trice: looke whether ſoever thou directeſt it, there it is;
and or ever thou calleſt it backe, it is at home again.</hi> Now, is there
a body that can be in divers places at once, or that can paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
removing, or that can move otherwiſe than in time, yea and in
ſuch time as (within a little under or over) is proportioned both to
his pace, and to the lenght of the way which it hath to goe: Then
is it certain that our Soule is not a bodily ſubſtance; which thing
appeareth ſo much the more plainly, in that being lodged in this
body which is ſo movable, it removeth not with the body. Alſo it
is a ſure ground, that two bodies connot mutually enter either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
other, nor conteine either other: but the greater muſt alway
needes conteine, and the leſſer muſt needes be conteined. But by
our Soules, we enter, not only either into others bodies, but alſo
either into others <hi>minds,</hi> ſo as we comprehend either other by
mutuall underſtanding, and imbrace either other by mutuall loving.
It followeth then that this ſubſtance which is able to receive a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſſe
thing, can be no body; and that ſo much the rather, for that
the body which ſeemeth to hold it, conteineth it not. Nay verily,
this Soule of ours is ſo farre of from being a bodily ſubſtance, and
is ſo manifeſtly a Spirit; that to lodge all things in it ſelfe, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them all after a ſort ſpirituall, and bereveth them of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and if there were any bodylineſſe in it, it were unable to enter
into the knowledge of a bodie. So in a Glaſſe a thouſand ſhapes
are ſeene: but if the <hi>cleere</hi> of the Glaſſe had any peculiar ſhape of it
owne, the Glaſſe could yeeld none of thoſe ſhapes at all. Alſo all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
things are imprinted in the eye; but if the ſight of the eye had
any <hi>peculiar colour</hi> of it owne, it would be a blemiſh to the ſight, ſo
as it ſhould either not ſee at all, or elſe all things ſhould ſeeme like
to that blemiſh. Likewiſe, whereas the Tongue is the diſcerner of
all taſts; if it be not cleere but cumbered with humours, all things
are of taſte like to the humour, ſo as if it be bitter, they alſo be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
&amp; if it be wateriſh, they be wateriſh to; yea and if it be bitter, it
can not judge of bitternes it ſelf. That a thing may receive all ſhapes
all colours, and all taſts; it behoveth the ſame to be cleere from all
ſhapes, from all colour, and from all ſavour of it own. And that a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113444:10"/>
thing may in underſtanding know and conceive all bodies, as our
ſoule doth, it behoveth the ſame to be altogether bodileſſe it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for had it any bodilineſſe at all, it could not receive any body into it.
If we look yet more neerly into the nature of a body, we ſhall finde
that no body receiveth into it the ſubſtantiall forme of another bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
without loſing or altering his own, ne paſſeth from one form in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another, without the marring of the firſt; as is to be ſeen in wood
when it receiveth fire, in ſeeds when they ſpring forth into bud,
and ſo in other things. What is to be ſaid then of mans ſoul, which
receiveth and conceiveth the forms and ſhapes of all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
corrupting his own, and moreover becommeth the perfecter by
the more receiving? For the more it receiveth, the more it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth;
and the more it underſtandeth, the more perfect it is.</p>
            <p>If it be a bodily ſubſtance, from whence is it and of what mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
If it be of the foure Elements, how can they give life, having
no life of themſelves? Or how can they give underſtanding, having
no ſence? If it be of the mixture of them, how may it be ſaid that of
divers things which have no being of themſelves, ſhould be made
a thing that hath being? Or that of divers outſides ſhould be made
one body? or of divers bodies, one Soul? or of divers deaths, one life?
or of divers darkneſſes, one light? Nay rather, why ſay we not that
he which beyond nature hath made the mixture of theſe bodies, hath
for the perfecting of our body, breathed a Soul alſo into the body?
To be ſhort, the property of a body is to ſuffer, and the property of
our Soule is to doe. And if the body be not put forth by ſome other
thing than it ſelf, it is a very block; whereas the mind that is in our
Soul ceaſeth not to ſtir up and down in it ſelfe, though it have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to move it from without. Therefore it is to be concluded by
theſe reaſons and by the like, that our Soul is a bodileſſe ſubſtance,
notwithſtanding that it is united to our body.</p>
            <p>And hereupon it followeth alſo,<note place="margin">Vnmateriall.</note> that our Soule is not any mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
thing, for as much as matter receiveth not any forme or ſhape
but according to his owne quantity, and but onely one forme at
once, whereas our Soule receiveth all formes without quantity,
come there never ſo many at once or ſo great. Againe, no matter
admitteth two contrary formes at once; but our Soule contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
comprehendeth and receiveth them together, as fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
heat and cold, white and black; and not only together, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the better by the matching and laying of them together. To be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113444:11"/>
ſhort, ſeeing that the <hi>more wee depart from matter, the more wee
underſtand:</hi> ſurely nothing is more contrary to the ſubſtance of our
Soule, than is the nature of matter. Furthermore, if this reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſoule of ours is neither a bodily nor a materiall thing, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon matter in the beſt actions thereof: then muſt it needs
be of it ſelf, and not proceed either from body or from matter. For
what doth a body bring forth but a body; and matter but matter;
and materiall but materialls: And therefore it is an unmateriall
ſubſtance, which hath being of it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee whether the ſame be corruptible and mortall on
no.<note place="margin">The Soul hath being of it ſelf. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Treatiſe why God deferreth the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked. Vncorruptible</note> Soothly, if <hi>Plutarch</hi> be to be beleeved, it is in vain to diſpute
thereof. For he teacheth, that the <hi>doctrine of Gods providence,</hi> and
the <hi>immortalitie of our Soules are</hi> ſo <hi>linked together,</hi> that the one
is as an appendant to the other. And in very deed, to what purpoſe
were the World created, if there were no body to behold it: Or to
what end behold wee the Creator in the world, but to ſerve him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And why ſhould we ſerve him upon <hi>no hope:</hi> And to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
hath he indewed us with theſe rare gifts of his, which for the
moſt part doe but put us to pain and trouble in this life: if we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
like the brute Beaſt or the Hearbes, which know him not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Howbeit, for the better ſatisfying of the ſilly Soules which go on
ſtill like witleſſe Beaſtes, without taking ſo much leyſure in all
their life, as once to enter into themſelves; let us indevour here by
lively reaſons to paint out unto them againe their true ſhape, which
they labour to deface with ſo much filthineſſe. The Soule of man
(as I have ſayd afore) is not a body, neyther doth it increaſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
with the body: but contrary wiſe the more the body decayeth,
the more doth the underſtanding increaſe; and the neerer that the
body draweth unto death, the more <hi>freely</hi> doth the mind underſtand;
and the more that the body <hi>abateth</hi> in fleſh, the more <hi>workfull</hi> is
the mind. And why then ſhould we think, that the thing which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
the ſtronger by the weakneſſe of the body, and which is
advanced by the decay of the body, ſhould <hi>returne to duſt</hi> with the
body: A mans Sences fayle becauſe his eyes fayle, and his eyes
fayle becauſe the Spirits of them fayle: but the <hi>blind</hi> mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
increaſeth, becauſe his eyes are not buſide: and the olde
mans reaſon becommeth the more perfect by the loſſe of his ſight.
Therefore why ſay we not that the body fayleth the Soul, and not
the Soule the body; and <hi>that the Glaſſes are out of the Spectacles</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:113444:11"/>
but <hi>the eyſight is ſtill good:</hi> Why ſhould we deeme the Soule to
be forgone with the Sences: If the eye be the thing that ſeeth, and
the care the thing that heareth; why doe we not ſee things double,
and heare ſounds double, ſeeing we have two eyes and two ears?
It is the ſoule then that ſeeth and heareth; and theſe which wee
take to be our ſences, are but the inſtruments of our ſences. And if
when our eyes be ſhut or picked out, we then behold a <hi>thouſand</hi>
things in our minde; yea, and that our underſtanding ir then moſt
<hi>quick-ſighted,</hi> when the quickeſt of our eyſight is as good as quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or ſtarke dead: how is it poſſible that the reaſonable ſoule
ſhould be tyed and bound to the ſences? What a reaſon is it to ſay
that the ſoule dyeth with the ſences, ſeeing that the true ſences doe
then grow and increaſe, when the inſtruments of ſenſe doe die?
And what a thing were it, to ſay that beaſt is dead, becauſe he
hath loſt his eyes, when we our ſelves ſee, that it liveth after it hath
forgone the eyes? Alſo I have proved that the ſoule is neither
the body, nor an appertenance of the body. Sith it is ſo, why mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
we that thing by the body, which meaſureth all bodies; or make
that to die with the body, whereby the bodies that die, yea many
hundred years agoe, doe after a certain manner live ſtill? Or what
can hurt that thing, whom nothing hurteth or hindereth in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
Though a man loſe an arme, yet doth his ſoule abide whole
ſtill. Let him forgoe the one halfe of his body, yet is his ſoule as
<hi>ſound</hi> as afore: for it is whole in it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whole in every part of
it ſelfe, <hi>united</hi> in it ſelfe and in the own ſubſtance, and by the force
and power thereof it <hi>ſheadeth</hi> it ſelfe into all parts of the body.
Though the body rot away by piecemeal, yet abideth the Soule
all one and undiminiſhed. Let the bloud dreyn out, the moving wax
weake, the ſences faile, and the ſtrength periſh; and yet abideth the
minde nevertheleſſe ſound and lively even to the end. <hi>Her houſe
muſt be pierced through on all ſides, ere ſhee be diſcouraged;</hi> her
walls muſt be battered down ere ſhe fall to fleeting; and ſhe never
forſaketh her lodging, till no room be left her to lodge in. True it
is, that the brute beaſts forgoe both life &amp; action with their bloud.
But as for our ſoule (if we conſider the matter well) it is then
gathered <hi>home into it ſelfe,</hi> and when our ſences are quenched, then
doth it moſt of all labour to <hi>ſurmount it ſelfe:</hi> working as goodly
actions at the time that the body is at a point to fail it, yea and
often times far <hi>goodlier</hi> alſo, than ever it did during the whole
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113444:12"/>
life time thereof. As for example, <hi>it taketh order for it ſelfe,</hi> for our
houſehold, for the Common-weale, and for a <hi>whole Kingdome;</hi> and
that with more uprightneſſe, <hi>godlineſſe, wiſdome;</hi> and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than ever it did afore, yea and perchance in a body ſo far ſpent,
ſo bare, ſo conſumed, ſo withered without, and ſo putrified within,
that whoſoever looks upon him ſees nothing but earth, and yet to
<hi>heare him ſpeake</hi> would <hi>raviſh a man up to heaven,</hi> yea, and <hi>above
heaven.</hi> Now when a man ſees <hi>ſo lively a ſoule in ſo weake and
wretched a body, may he not ſay as is ſaid of the hatching of chickens,
that the ſhell is broken, but there commeth forth a chicken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo let us ſee what is the ordinary cauſe that things periſh. Fire
doth either goe out for want of nouriſhment, or is quenched by his
contrary which is water. Water is reſolved into aire by fire, which
is his contrary. The cauſe why the Plant dyeth, is extremitie of
cold or drought, or unſeaſonable cutting, or violent plucking up.
Alſo the living wight dyeth through contrarietie of humours, or
for want of food, or by feeding upon ſome thing that is againſt the
nature of it, or by outward violence. Of all theſe cauſes, which can
we chooſe to have any power againſt our Soule: I ſay againſt the
Soule of man which (notwithſtanding that it be united to matter
and to a bodie) is it ſelfe a ſubſtance unbodily, unmateriall, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceivable in underſtanding: The contrarietie of things: Nay,
what can be contrarie to that which <hi>lodgeth the contraries alike e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
in himſelfe:</hi> which underſtandeth the one of them by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
which coucheth them all under one skill? and (to be ſhort) in
whom the <hi>contrarieties themſelves abandon their contrarieties, ſo</hi>
as they doe not any more purſue but inſue one another: Fire is
hote, and water cold. Our bodies miſlike theſe contraries, and are
grieved by them; but our <hi>mind linketh them together without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet
burning or cooling it ſelfe;</hi> and it ſetteth the one of them againſt
the other to know them the better. The things which <hi>deſtroy</hi> one
another through the whole world, do <hi>mainteine one another in our
minds.</hi> Againe, nothing is more contrary to peace then warre is;
and yet mans mind can skill to make or mainteine peace in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for warre, and to lay earneſtly for warre in ſeeking or inioying
of peace. Even death it ſelfe (which diſpatcheth our life) cannot bee
contrary to the life of our Soule: <hi>for it ſeeketh life by death, and
death by life.</hi> And what can that thing meet withall in the whole
world, that may be able to overthrow it, which can <hi>inioyne obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:113444:12"/>
               <hi>to things moſt contrary?</hi> What then Want of food: How
can that want food in the world, which can skill to feed on the
whole world: Or how ſhould that forſake food, which the <hi>fuller</hi> it
is, <hi>ſo much the hungryer it is;</hi> and the more it hath digeſted, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able it is to digeſt: The bodily wight feedeth upon ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
things, but <hi>our mind feedeth upon all things.</hi> Take from it
the ſenſible things, and the things of und<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſtanding abide with it
ſtill: bereave it of earthly things, and the <hi>heavenly remayne abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</hi>
To be ſhort, abridge it of all worldly things, yea and of the
world it ſelfe, and <hi>even then doth it feed at greateſt eaſe, &amp; maketh
beſt cheere agreeable to his owue nature.</hi> Alſo the bodily wight fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it ſelfe to a certain meaſure, and delighteth in ſome certain
things. But <hi>what can fill our mind?</hi> Fill it as full as ye can with
the knowledge of things, and it is ſtill <hi>eager</hi> and <hi>ſharpe ſet</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more. The more it taketh in, the more it ſtill craveth: and yet
for all that, it never feeleth any <hi>rawneſſe</hi> or lack of digeſtion. What
ſhall I ſay more: <hi>diſcharge our underſtanding from the minding
of it ſelfe,</hi> and <hi>then doth it live in him and of him in whom all things
doelive.</hi> Againe, fill it with the knowledge of it ſelfe, and then doth
it feele it ſelfe moſt <hi>empty,</hi> and ſharpeſt ſet upon deſire of the other.
Now then, can that die or decay for want of food, which cannot be
glutted with any thing, which is <hi>nouriſhed and maintained with
all things,</hi> and <hi>which liveth in very deed upon him by whom all
the things which we wonder at here beneath are upheld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what elſe is violence, but a iuſtling of two bodies together:
and how can there be any ſuch betweene a bodie &amp; a ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
yea or of two ſpirits one againſt another, ſeeing that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
when they would deſtroy one another, they uphold one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
And if the Soule <hi>cannot be puſhed at,</hi> neither inwardly nor
outwardly: is there any thing in nature that can naturally <hi>hurt it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
No: but it may perchance be weakened by the very <hi>force</hi> of his
encounter, as we ſee it doth befall to our ſences. For the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and the more ſenſible the thing is in his kind which the ſence
receiveth, ſo much the more alſo is the ſence it ſelfe offended or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
therewith. As for example, the feeling, by fire; the taſt, by harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
the ſmelling, by ſavours; the hearing, by the hideouſneſſe of
noyſe, whether it be of Thunderclap or of the falling of a River;
and the ſight, by looking upon the Sunne, upon Fire, and upon all
things that have a gliſtering brightneſſe. I omit, that in the moſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113444:13"/>
of theſe things, it is not properly the ſenſe it ſelfe, but the outward
inſtrument of ſenſe onely that is offended or hurt. But let us ſee if
there bee the like in our reaſonable ſoule. Nay, contrariwiſe the
<hi>more of underſtanding and excellencie that the thing is, the more
doth it refreſh and comfort our minde.</hi> If it be darke ſo as wee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it but by halves, it hurteth us not, but yet doth it not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
us. Nay, as we increaſe in underſtanding it, ſo doth it like us
the better, and the <hi>higher</hi> it is, the more doth it <hi>ſtir up the power</hi>
of our underſtanding, and (as you would ſay) <hi>reach us the hand</hi>
to draw us to the attainment thereof. As for them that are dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted,
we forbid them to behold the things that are over-bright.
But as for them that are of raweſt capacity, wee offer them the
things that are moſt underſtandable. When the ſence beginneth to
perceive moſt ſharply, then it is fain to give over, as if it felt the
very <hi>death of it ſelfe.</hi> Contrariwiſe, when the minde beginneth to
underſtand, then is it moſt deſirous to hold on ſtill. And whereof
commeth that, but that our ſenſes work by bodily inſtruments, but
our <hi>mind worketh by a bodileſſe ſubſtance</hi> which needeth not the
help of the body. And ſeeing that the nature, the nouriſhment and
the actions of our ſoule, are ſo far differing, both from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nouriſhment, and actions of the body, and from all that ever is
done or wrought by the body, can there be any thing more chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
than to deem our ſoul to be mortall by the abating &amp; decaying
of our ſences, or by the mortallity of our bodies? Nay contrariwiſe
it may be moſt ſoundly and ſubſtantially concluded thereupon that
mans ſoule is of its <hi>own nature immortall,</hi> ſeeing that all death as
well violent as naturall commeth of the body and by the body.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee further what death or corruption is.<note place="margin">What is death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> It is (ſay they)
a ſeparating of the matter from his forme. And foraſmuch as in
man the ſoule is conſidered to be the forme, and the body to be as
the matter, the ſeparation of the ſoule from the body is commonly
called death. Now then, what death can there be of the ſoule.
ſith it is unmateriall, as I have ſaid afore, and a forme that abideth
of it ſelfe? For (as one ſaith) a man may take away the roundneſſe
or ſquareneſſe from a table of copper, becauſe they have no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
but in the matter: but had they ſuch a round or ſquare form, as
might have an abiding without matter or ſtuffe wherein to be, out
of doubt, ſuch forme or ſhape ſhould continue for ever. Nay (which
more is) how can that be the corrupter of a thing, which is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113444:13"/>
thereof: The leſſe corſineſſe a man hath, the more hath he
of reaſon and underſtanding. <hi>The leſſe our minds be tyed to theſe
bodily things, the more lively and cheerefull be they.</hi> At a word, the
full and perfect life thereof, is the full and utter withdrawing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
from the bodie and whatſoever the bodie is made of. All theſe
things are ſo cleere as they neede no proofe. Now, wee know that
every thing worketh according to the proper being therof and that
the ſame which <hi>perfecteth the operations</hi> of a thing, <hi>perfecteth the
being thereof alſo.</hi> It followeth therefore, that ſith the ſeparation
of the body from the Soule, and of the forme from the matter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth
the operation or working of the ſoule (as I have ſayd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
it doth alſo make perfect and ſtrengthen the very being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and therefore cannot in any wiſe corrupt it. And what elſe is dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but to be corrupted? And what els is corrupting but ſuffering:
And what els is ſuffering, but receiving: And how can that which
receiveth all things without ſuffering, receive corruption by any
thing? Fire corrupteth or marreth our bodies, and we ſuffer in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it. So doth alſo extreme colde: but if we ſuffered nothing
by it, it could not freeſe us. Our ſences likewiſe are marred by the
exceſſive force of the things which they light upon. And that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they receive and perceive the thing that grieveth them, and
for that the manner of their behaving of themſelves towards their
objects, is ſubiect to ſuffering. But as for the reaſonable Soule;
which receiveth all things after one manner, that is to wit, by way of
underſtanding, where through it alway worketh &amp; is <hi>never wrought
into,</hi> how is it poſſible for it to corrupt or <hi>marre it ſelfe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what is the thing whereat our Soule ſuffereth ought in the
ſubſtance thereof, I meane whereby the ſubſtance of our Soule is
any whit impaired or hurt by minding or conceiving the ſame in
underſtanding: As little doth the fire hurt it as the aire, and the
aire as the fire. As little hurt receiveth it by the frozen ice of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wey,</hi>
as by the ſcorching ſands of <hi>Affricke.</hi> As little alſo doth vice
annoy it as vertue. For vice and vertue are ſo farre of from incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
the ſubſtance of the ſoule, that our mind doth never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
or underſtand them better, than by ſetting them together one
againſt another. <hi>That thing therefore which doth no whit appaire
it ſelfe, but taketh the ground of perfecting it ſelfe by all things, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be marred or hurt by any thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, what is death: The <hi>uttermoſt point of moving, and the</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:113444:14"/>
               <hi>uttermoſt bound of this life.</hi> For even <hi>in living we dye, and in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we live,</hi> and there is not that ſtep which we ſet downe in this
life, which doth not continually ſtep forward unto death, after
the manner of a Diallor a Clock, which mounting up by certain
degrees forgoeth his moving in moving from Minute to Minute.
<hi>Take away moving from a body, and it doth no more live.</hi> Now
let us ſee if the ſoul alſo be carryed with the ſame moving. If it be
caryed with the ſame moving, then doth it undoubtedly move there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall.
Nay contrariwiſe, whether the mind reſt, or whether it be
buzyed about the proper operations thereof, it is not perceived
either by any panting of hart, or by any beating of pulſes, or by any
breathing of Lungs. It is then as a Ship that carieth us away
with it, whether we walke or ſit ſtill; the ſticking faſt whereof or
the tying thereof to a poſte, hindereth not our going up and downe
in it ſtill. Againe, if the ſoule be ſubiect to the sfin corruption of
the body, then is it ſubiect to the alterations thereof alſo; and if it
be ſubject to the alterations, it is ſubject to time alſo. For altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or changes, are ſpices, or rather conſequents of moving, and
movings are not made but in time. Now man in reſpect of the
body hath certain full poynts or ſtops, at the which he receiveth
manifeſt changes, and thereafter groweth or decayeth. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
where the decay of the body beginneth, there beginneth the
chief ſtrength of the mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Howbeit that in ſome men, not only
their chinnes are covered with down, but alſo their beards become
gray, whoſe minds for want of exerciſe, ſhew no ſigne at all either
of ripeneſſe or growing. Moreover, time (as in reſpect of the body)
cannot be called againe, but in <hi>reſpect of the mind it is alwayes
preſent.</hi> Yea and <hi>time perfecteth, accompliſheth, and increaſeth our
mind,</hi> and after a ſort reneweth and freſheth it from day to day,
whereas contrariwiſe it forweareth, waſheth away and quight
conſumeth, both it ſelfe, and the body with the life thereof. It follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
then that the reaſonable Soule is not ſubject to time, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
to any of the changes and corruption that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
time. Nay we may ſay thus much more; That <hi>nothing in the
whole world is nouriſhed with things better than it ſelfe; neither
doth any of them contain greater things than it ſelfe;</hi> But the
things that are corruptible do live of corruptible things, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live without corrupting them: as for example, beaſts live by
herbs, men by beaſts, and ſo forth. And therefore things which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113444:14"/>
live by uncorruptible things, and can ſo receive and digeſt them, as
to turne them into the nouriſhment of their nature, and yet not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
them; are uncorruptible themſelves to. Now the Soule of
man, I meane the reaſonable ſoule or mind, conceiveth reaſon and
truth, and is fed and ſtrengthened with them. And reaſon and truth
are things unchangeable, not ſubject to time, place or alteration,
but ſteady, unchaungeable, and everlaſting. For that twice two be
fower, and that there is the ſame reaſon in the proportion of eight
unto ſix that is of fower unto three, or that in a Triangle, the three
inner angles are equall with the too right angles; and ſuch like;
are truths, which neither years, nor thouſands of years can
change; as true at this day, as they were when <hi>Euclide</hi> firſt ſpake
them. And ſo forth of other things. It followeth then that the <hi>Soule
comprehending reaſon and truth, which are things free from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
cannot in any wiſe be ſubject to corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Who is he of all men that deſireth not to be immort all?
And how could any man deſire it, if he underſtood not what it is?
Or how could he be able to underſtand it, unleſſe it were poſſible
for him to attain unto it?</hi> Surely none of us coveteth to be begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningleſſe,
for none of us is ſo; neither can any of us be ſo. And as we
cannot ſo be, ſo alſo can we not comprehend what it is. For who is
he that it not at his wits end, but onely to thinke upon eternitie
without beginning? On the contrary part there is not <hi>ſo baſe a
minde which coveteth not to live for ever,</hi> inſomuch that whereas
we looke not for it by nature, we ſeeke to obtain it by skill and
pollicie, <hi>ſome by books, ſome by Images,</hi> and ſome by other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
and even the <hi>groſſeſt ſort can well imagine in themſelves
what immortality is, and are able both to conceive it, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it.</hi> Whence comes this, but that our ſoules being created
cannot conceive an everlaſtingneſſe without beginning, and yet
nevertheleſſe, that <hi>foraſmuch as they be created immortall, they doe
well conceive an immortality or everlaſtingneſſe without end?</hi> And
<hi>whereto ſerves this univerſall deſire, if it be not naturall?</hi> or how
<hi>is it naturall if it be in vain?</hi> and not onely in vain, but alſo to
bring us to hell and to torment? Let us wade yet deeper. <hi>Who
can diſpute, or once ſo much as doubt whether the ſoule be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
or no, but he that is capable of Immortality,</hi> And who can
<hi>underſtand what difference is betwixt mortall and Immortall, but he
that is Immortall?</hi> Man is able to diſcerne the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

that which is reaſon, and that which is not, and thereupon
we terme him reaſonable. Whoſoever would hold opinion that a
man is not reaſonable, ſhould need none other diſproof than his own
diſputing thereof; for he would go about to prove it by reaſon. Man
can skill to diſcerne the mortall natures from the immortall, and
therefore we may well ſay he is immortall. For he that ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to the contrary, ſhall be driven to bring ſuch reaſons, as ſhall
of themſelves make him to prove himſelfe immortall. Thou ſayeſt
the ſoule cannot be immortall: and why? Becauſe (ſayſt thou)
that to be ſo, it would behove it to worke ſeverally by it ſelfe from
the body. When thou thinkeſt that in thy minde, conſider what thy
body doth at the ſame time. Nay, yet further, who hath taught thee
ſo much of the immortall nature, if thou thy ſelfe be not immortall?
<hi>Or what worldly wight can ſay what the inworking of a reaſonable
wight is, but the wight which in it ſelfe hath the uſe of reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet ſayeſt thou ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the ſoule be immortall, it is free from
ſuch and ſuch paſſions. How entereſt thou ſo far into the Nature
that is ſo far above thee, if thou thy ſelfe beeſt mortall? All the
reaſons which thou alleadgeſt againſt the immortality of the ſoule
doe fight directly to the proofe of it. For if thy reaſon mounted no
higher than to the things that are mortall, thou ſhouldeſt know
neither mortall nor immortall. Now it is not ſome one covetous
man above all other, that deſireth immortality, nor ſome one man
excelling all others in wiſdome, that comprehendeth it, but <hi>all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>
without exception. It is not then ſome one ſeverall skill or
ſome one naturall property, that maketh ſuch difference between
man and man as we ſee to be between many, but rather one ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame

their bodies. If ever thou haſt looked to die, conſider what diſcourſe
thou madeſt then in thy minde, thou never couldeſt perſwade thy
conſcience, nor make thy reaſon to conceive, that the ſoule ſhould

hath diſputed of it all his life long, when he commeth to death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queatheth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113444:15"/>
a yearly penſion for the keeping of a yearly feaſt on the

birth of a <hi>Swine,</hi> ſeeing he eſteemeth himſelfe to be <hi>no better than
ſo?</hi> Nay, what elſe is this, than a <hi>crying out of his nature againſt

and at that inſtant painteth againe before his eyes, the ſelfeſame
thing which he tooke ſo much pains to deface. And in good ſooth,
what a number have we ſeen, which having been deſpiſers of all
Religion, have at the hower of death been glad to <hi>vow</hi> their ſoules

then, let us rather ſay, I had lever ſee an Atheiſt or an Epicure
witneſſe the immortallity of the ſoule, and willingly taking an
honourable farewell of nature upon a ſcaffold, then to heare all the
Doctors of the world diſcourſing of it in their pulpits. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

that is to wit, of men beſotted and falne aſleepe in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
and pleaſures of this world, where the wine and the exceſſe
of meat, and the vapors that fumed up of them did ſpeake, and not
the <hi>men</hi> themſelves.<note place="margin">Three lives in man.</note> What ſhall I ſay more? I have told you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
that in the inward man there are (as ye would ſay) three men,
the living, the ſenſitive, and the reaſonable. Let us ſay therefore
that in the ſame perſon there are three lives continued from one to
another: namely, the life of the Plant, the life of the Beaſt, and the
life of the Man or of the Soule. So long as a man is in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
womb, he doth not onely live and grow; his ſpirit ſeemeth
to ſleep, and his ſences ſeem to be in a <hi>ſlumber,</hi> ſo as he ſeemeth
to be nothing elſe then a plant. Nevertheleſſe, if ye conſider his
eyes, his ears, his tongue, his ſences, and his movings, you will
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113444:16"/>
eaſily judg that he is not made to be for ever in that <hi>priſon,</hi> where he
neither ſeeth nor heareth, nor hath any room to walk in, but rather
that he is made to come forth into an opener place, where hee may
have what to ſee and behold, and wherewith to occupy all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which we ſee to be in him. As ſoon as he is come out, he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to ſee, to feel, and to move, and by little and little falleth to the
perfect uſing of his limbs, and findeth in this world a peculiar object
for every of them, as viſible things for the eye, ſounds for his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bodily things for his feeling and ſo forth. But beſides al this, we
find there a <hi>mind;</hi> which by the eys as by windows beholdeth the
world, and yet in all the world finding not any one thing worthy
to reſt wholly upon, <hi>mounteth up to him that made it; which minde
like an Empreſſe lodgeth in the whole world,</hi> and not alonely in this
body; which by the ſences (and oftentimes alſo without the ſences)
<hi>mounteth above the ſences, and ſtreyneth it ſelf to go out of it ſelf, as a
child doth to get out of his mothers wombe.</hi> And therefore we ought
ſurely to ſay, <hi>that this Mind or Reaſon ought not to be ever in priſon.</hi>
That one day it ſhall ſee cleerly, and not by theſe dimme and cloudy
<hi>ſpectacles:</hi> That it ſhall come in place where it ſhall have the true
object of underſtanding: and that hee ſhall have his life free from
theſe <hi>fetters</hi> and from all the affections of the body. To be ſhort, that
as man is prepared in his mothers wombe to be brought forth into
the world; ſo is he alſo after a ſort prepared in this body and in this
world, to live in another world. We then underſtand it, when by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it behoveth us to depart out of the world. And what child is
there which (if nature did not by her cunning drive him out,) would
of himſelf come out of his <hi>Covert,</hi> or that cometh not out as good as
forlorn and <hi>half dead;</hi> or that if he had at that time knowledge and
ſpeech, would not call that <hi>death,</hi> which we call birth; and that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
out of life, which we call the entrance into it? As long as we
be there, we ſee nothing though our eys be open. Many alſo do not
ſo much as ſtir, except it be at ſome ſodain ſcaring or ſome other like
chance; and as for thoſe that ſtir, they know not that they have
either ſence or moving. Why then ſhould wee thinke it ſtrange,
that in this life our underſtanding ſeeth ſo little, that many men doe
never mind the immortall nature, untill they be at the laſt caſt, yea,
and ſome thinke not themſelves to have any ſuch thing, howbeit
that even by ſo thinking they ſhew themſelves to have part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
And imagine wee that the <hi>unborn babe</hi> hath not as much adoe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113444:16"/>
by nature to leave the poore skin that hee is <hi>wrapt</hi> in, as wee have
hinderance in our ſences and in our impriſoned reaſon, when wee be
at the point to leave the goods and pleaſures of this world, and the
very fleſh it ſelf which holdeth us as in a grave? Or had the babe
ſome little knowledge; would he not ſay that no life were <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
to the life where he then is, as we ſay there is no life to the life
of this world wherein we be? Or would he not account the ſtage of
our ſences for a fable, as a great ſort of us account the ſtage that is
prepared for our Souls? Yes ſurely: and therefore let us conclude
where wee began, namely that man is both inward and outward.
In the outward man, which is the body, he reſembleth the being
and the proportion of all the parts of the world. And in the inner
man he reſembleth whatſoever kinde of life is in all things, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that beareth life in the world. In this mothers womb he
liveth the life of a plant, howbeit with this further, that he hath a
certain <hi>commencement</hi> of ſenſe and moving which exceed the
Plant, and doe put him in a readineſſe to be indowed with Sences
as a Beaſt is. In this life he hath Senſe and moving in their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is the property of a ſenſitive wight; but yet beſides theſe,
he hath alſo a beginning to reaſon and underſtand, which are a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of another life, ſuch as the ſenſitive wight hath not, and this
life is to be perfected in another place. In the life to come he hath
his actions free and full perfected, a large ground to worke upon,
able to ſuffice him to the full, and a light to his underſtanding in
ſtead of a light to the eye. And <hi>like as in comming into the world,
he came as it were out of another world; ſo in going yet into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, he muſt alſo goe out of this world.</hi> He commeth out of
the firſt world into the ſecond, as it were fayling in nouriſhment,
but growing in ſtrength unto moving and ſenſe: and he goeth out
of the ſecond into the third, failing in ſences and moving, but grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in reaſon and underſtanding. <hi>Now ſeeing we call the paſſage
out of the firſt world into the ſecond a birth, what reaſon is it that
we ſhould call the paſſage out of the ſecond into the third a death?</hi>
To be ſhort, he that conſidereth how all the actions of mans mind
tend to the time to come, without poſſibility of ſtaying upon the
preſent time, how pleaſant and delightfull ſoever it be: we may wel
diſcerne by them all, that his being (which in every thing (as ſayth
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) followeth the working thereof) is alſo <hi>wholy bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the time to come;</hi> as who would ſay this preſent life were
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113444:17"/>
unto it but as a narrow grindle, on the further ſide whereof (as i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
were on the bank of ſome ſtreame or running water,) he were to
finde his <hi>true dwelling place and very home in deed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now is it time to ſee what is ſayd to the contrarie:<note place="margin">Objections.</note> wherein we have to conſider eftſoons that which we ſpake of afore; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that <hi>if all that ever is in us were tranſitoric and mortall, wee
ſhould not be ſo witty to examine the Immortallitie as we be:</hi> for
of contraries the skill is all one. If a man were not mortall, that
is to ſay, if he had no life, he could not diſpute of the mortall life;
neither could he ſpeake of the immortall, if he himſelfe alſo were not
immortall. Therefore let us goe back retrive. Some man will
ſay, that the ſoule dyeth with the body, becauſe the ſoule and
the body are but one thing, and he believeth that they be both but
one, becauſe he ſeeth no more but the body. This argument is all
one with theirs, which denyed that there is any God, becauſe they
ſaw him not. But yet by his doings thou maiſt perceive that
there is a God: <hi>diſcerne likewiſe by the dooings of thy ſoule, that
thou haſt a ſoule.</hi> For in a dead body thou ſeeſt the ſame parts
remain, but thou ſeeſt not the ſame doings that were in it afore.
When a man is dead, his eye ſeeth nothing at all, and yet is there
nothing changed of his eye: but while he is alive he ſeeth infinite
things that are divers. The power then which ſeeth is not of the
body. Yet notwithſtanding, how lively and quick-ſighted ſoever
the eye be; it ſeeth not it ſelfe. Wonder not therefore though thou
have a ſoule, and that the ſame ſoule ſee not it ſelfe. For if thine ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
ſaw it ſelfe, it were not a power or ability of ſeeing, but avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
thing: likewiſe, if thy ſoule ſaw it ſelfe, it were no more a
Soule, that is to ſay the worker and quickner of the body, but a
very body, unable to doe any thing of it ſelfe, and a maſſie ſubſtance
ſubject to ſuffering. For we ſee nothing but the body and bodily
ſubſtances. But in this thou perceiveſt ſomwhat elſe than a body
(as I have ſaid afore) that if thine eye had any peculiar colour of
it own, it could not diſcerne any other colour than that. Seeing
then that thou conceiveſt ſo many divers bodies at once in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
needs muſt thou have a power in thee which is not a body.
Be it (ſay they) that we have a power of ſenſe; yet have we not a
power of reaſon; for that which we call the power of reaſon or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
is nothing but an excellencie or rather a conſequence
offence, inſomuch that when ſenſe dyeth, the reſidue dyeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113444:17"/>
with alſo. Soothly in this which thou haſt ſaid, thou haſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
ſence; which thing thou haddeſt not done, if thou haddeſt
nothing in thee beyond ſence. For whereas thou ſayeſt, if the ſence
dye, the reſt dyeth alſo; it is a reaſon that proceedeth from one
terme to another, and it is a gathering of reaſons which conclude
one thing by another. Now the ſences do indeed perceive their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
but yet how lively ſo ever they be, they reaſon not. Wee ſee a
Smoake; ſo farre extendeth the ſence. But if we inferre, therefore
there muſt needs be fire, and thereupon ſeeke who was the kindler
thereof: that ſurmounteth the ability of ſence. Wee heare a piece of
Muſicke; that may any beaſt do as well as we. But his hearing of
it is but as of a bare ſound; whereas our hearing thereof is as of
an harmony, and we diſcern the cauſe of the concords and diſcords,
which eyther delight or offend our ſence. The thing that heareth the
ſound is the ſence; but the thing that judgeth of that which the ſence
conceiveth, is another thing than the ſence. The like is to be ſaid of
Smelling, Taſting, and Feeling. Our ſmelling of ſents, our taſting of
ſavours, and our feeling of ſubſtances, is in deed the work of our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But as for our judging of the inward vertue of the thing by the
outward ſent thereof, or of the wholſomneſſe or unwholſomneſſe
of food by the taſte thereof, or of the hotneſſe or vehemency of a
Fever by feeling the Pulſe; yea and our proceeding even into the
very bowels of a man, whether the eye being the quickeſt of all
ſences is not able to attain; ſurely it is the worke of a more mighty
power than the Sence is. And in very deed there are Beaſts
which do heare, ſee, ſmell, taſte, and feel much better and quicklier
than man doth. Yet notwithſtanding none of them conferreth the
contraries of colours, ſounds, ſents and ſavours, none ſorteth them
out to the ſerving one of another, or to the ſerving of themſelves.
Whereby it appeareth, that man excelleth the beaſts by another
power than the ſences, and that whereas <hi>a man is a Painter, a
Muſician, or a Phiſician, he hath it from elſewhere then from his
ſences.</hi> Nay, I ſay farther, that oftentimes wee conclude clean
contrary to the report of our ſences. One eye perchance telleth us
that a Tower which we ſee afar off is round, whereas our reaſon
deemeth it to be ſquare: or that a thing is ſmall, which our reaſon
telleth us is great: or that the ends of lines in a long walke doe
meet in a point, whereas our reaſon certifieth us that they run
right forth with equall diſtance one from another. For want of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113444:18"/>
this diſcretion, certaine Elephants (ſayth <hi>Vitellio</hi>) which were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
over a long bridge, turned back being deceived; and yet they
wanted not ſight no more then we doe. But they that lead them
were not deceived. Their leaders then beſides their eyſight, had in
them annother vertue or power which corrected their ſight, and
therefore ought to be of higher eſtimation. In like caſe is it with
the reſt of the other ſences. For our hearing telleth us, that the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-clap
is after the lightning; but skill aſſureth us that they be
both together, for there is a certain power in us, which can skill
to diſcerne what proportion is between hearing and ſeeing. Alſo
the tongue of him that hath an ague, beareth him on hand that even
<hi>ſugar is bitter,</hi> which thing he knoweth by his reaſon to be untrue.
To be ſhort, thoſe which have their ſences moſt quick and lively,
be not of the greateſt wiſdome and underſtanding, A man therefore
differeth from a beaſt, and excelleth man by ſome other power than
ſence. For whereas it is commonly ſayd, that ſuch as have ſeen moſt
are commonly of greateſt skill, we ſee that many have travailed far
both by Sea and land, which have come home as wiſe as they went
forth. A horſe hath as good eyes as he that rides upon him, and
yet for all his travailing, neither he, nor peradventure his rider
whom he beareth become any whit the wiſer by that which they
have ſeene: whereby it appeareth that it is not enough to ſee things
unleſſe a man doe alſo minde them to his benefit.</p>
            <p>Now there is great difference between the livelyneſſe of the
Sence, and the power that governeth the Senſe; like as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of a Spie is one thing, and the Spie himſelfe is another, and
the wiſdome of the Captain that receiveth the report of the Spie
is a third. Nay, who can deny, that ſenſe and reaſon are divers
things; or rather: who will not grant, that in many things they be
clean contrary? Senſe biddeth us ſhun and eſhew griefe; whereas
reaſon willeth us to proffer our leg ſometime to the Surgeon to be
cut off. Senſe plucketh our hand out of the fire, and yet we our ſelves
put fire to our bare skin. Hee that ſhould ſee a <hi>Scevola</hi> burn off his
own hand, without ſo much as once gnaſhing his teeth at it, would
think he were utterly ſenſeleſſe: ſo mightily doth reaſon over-rule
ſenſe. To be ſhort, Senſe hath his peculiar inclination, which is appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
and reaſon likewiſe hath his, which is will. And like as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
doth often times over rule ſenſe, and is contrary to it, ſo will
correcteth the ſenſuall appetite or luſt that is in us, and warreth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113444:18"/>
againſt it. For in an Ague we covet to drinke, and in an Apoplexie
we covet to ſleepe, and in hunger we covet to eate, and yet from
all thoſe things doth our will reſtrain us. The more a man followeth
his luſt, the leſſe is he led by will: and the more he ſtandeth upon
the pleaſing of his ſences, the leſſe reaſon uſeth he ordinarily.</p>
            <p>Again, let us conſider the brute beaſts which have the ſenſitive
part as well as we. If we have no more than that, how commeth it
to paſſe that a little child driveth whole flocks and heards of them
whether he liſteth, and ſomtimes whether they would not? Whereof
commeth it that every of them in their kind, doe all live, neſtle, and
ſing after one ſort, whereas men have their Laws, Commonweales,
manners of building, and formes of reaſoning, not onely divers, but
alſo commonly contrary? Now what can harbour theſe contrarieties
together, but onely that which hath not any thing contrary unto it,
and wherein all contrary things, doe lay away their contrariety?
Surely it is not the ſenſe that can doe it, whoſe proper or peculiar
object is moſt contrary to the ſenſe. Beſides this (as I have ſaid afore)
whereas we conceive wiſdome, skill, vertue, and ſuch other things
which are all bodileſſe, our ſences have none other thing to work
upon, than the qualities of bodily ſubſtances. And whereas we make
univerſall rules of particular things, the ſences attain no farther
than to the particular things themſelves. And whereas we conclude
of the cauſes by their effects, our ſences perceive no more but the
bare effects: And whereas concerning the things that belong to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
the more underſtandable they be, the more they refreſh
us; contrariwiſe, the ſtronger that the ſenſible things are, the more
doe they offend the ſenſe: To be ſhort, the ſelfeſame thing which
we ſpeak in behalfe of the ſences, proceedeth from elſewhere than
from the Sences. And we will eaſily diſcerne, that he which denyeth
that beſides the common ſence, there is in man a reaſon or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
diſtinct and ſevered from the ſenſe, is voyd both of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and of ſence.</p>
            <p>But ſee here a groſſe reaſon of theirs. This reaſon or power of
underſtanding (ſay they) which is in man, is corruptible as well as
the power of perceiving by the Sences. I think I have proved
the contrary already, nevertheleſſe, let us examine their reaſons
yet further. The forme or ſhape of every thing (ſay they) doth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
with the matter. Now the ſoule is as you would ſay the forme
or ſhape of the body therefore it corrupteth with the body. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113444:19"/>
were rightly concluded, if it were meant of the materiall
forme. But I have proved that the ſoule is unmateriall, and hath a
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of ir ſelf. And indeed the more it is diſcharged of matter,
the more it retaineth his own peculiar forme. Therfore the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the matter toucheth not the foule at all. Again, if mens ſouls
live (ſay they) after their bodies, then are they infinite, for the world
is without beginning &amp; without ending, and (as we know) nature
can away with no infinite thing: therefore they live not after their
bodies. Yes, ſay I, for I have proved that the world hath a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and that with ſo ſubſtantial reaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as thou art not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.
Therfore it followeth that the inconvenience which thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeſt
can have no place. Another ſayth, If dead mens ſouls live ſtil,
why come they not to tell us ſo? And he thinketh he hath ſtumbled
upon a wonderfull ſubtle device. But how doth this follow in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
There hath not come any man unto us from the Indies a long
time: <hi>ergo</hi> there be no Indies. May not the ſame argument ſerve as
well to prove that we our ſelves are not, becauſe we never went
thither? Again, what intercourſe is there between things that have
bodies, and things that have no bodies, or between heaven and
earth, conſidering that there is ſo ſmal intercourſe even between men
which live under one ſelfeſame Sun? He that is made a Magiſtrate
in his own Countrey, doth not willingly return to the place of his
baniſhment. Likewiſe the <hi>Soule that is lodged in the lap of his God,
and come home into his native ſoyle, forgoeth the deſire of theſe lower
things, which to his ſight beholding them from above, and leſſe then
the point of a needle.</hi> On the other ſide, he that is put in cloſe priſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(how deſirous ſoever he be) cannot goe out; ſo that ſoule which is in
the <hi>Jarle of his ſoveraign Lord God, hath no reſpit or ſporting time to
come tell us what is done there.</hi> Unto the one, the beholding of the
everlaſting God is as a <hi>Paradice</hi> wherein he is willing to remain;
and unto the other his own condemnation is an impriſonment of his
will. But we would have God to ſend both the one &amp; the other unto
us to make us to believe. <hi>As who would ſay, it ſtood him greatly on
hand to have us to believe, and not rather us that we ſhould believe.</hi>
And in effect what elſe is all this, but a deſiring that ſome man might
return into his mothers womb again, to <hi>incourage young babes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the pinches and pains</hi> which they abide in their birth, wherof
they would be as ſhie as we be of death, if they had the like know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them? But let us let ſuch vanities paſſe, and come to the
ground.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:113444:19"/>
            <p>Yee beare us on hand (ſay they) that the ſoul of man is but
one, though it have divers powers. Whereof we ſee the ſenſitive,
and the growing powers to be corrupted and to periſh: therefore
it ſhould ſeeme that the underſtanding or reaſonable power alſo
ſhould doe the like. At a word, this is all one as if a man ſhould ſay,
you tell mee that this man, is both a good man, a good Sword-player,
and a good luteplayer altogether, and that becauſe his ſword
falls out of his hand, or his hand it ſelfe becommeth lame, therefore
he cannot be a good or honeſt man ſtill as you reported him to be.
Nay though he loſe thoſe inſtruments, yet ceaſeth he not therefore
to be an honeſt man, yea, and both a Sword-player, and a Lute-player
too, as in reſpect of skill. Likewiſe when our ſoules have
forgone theſe exerciſes, yet ceaſe they not to be the ſame they were
afore. To inlighten this point yet more; of the powers of our
Soule, ſome are exerciſed by the inſtruments of the body, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome
vvithout any help or furtherance of the body at all. Thoſe
vvhich are exerciſed by the body, are the ſences and the powers of
the ſences, and the powers of the grovving, vvhich may carrie the
ſime likeneſſe that is between a Luter and a Lute. Breake the
Luters Lute, and his cunning remaineth ſtill, but his putting of it in
practice faileth. Give him another Lute and hee falls to play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new again. Put out a mans eye, and yet the ability of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abideth ſtill with him, though the very act of ſeeing be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
But give unto the oldeſt Hag that is, the ſame eyes that
he had when he was young, and he ſhall ſee as well as ever he did.
After the ſame manner is it with the growing or thriving power.
Reſtore unto it a good ſtomack, a ſound liver, and a perfect heart;
and it ſhall execute his functions as well as ever it did afore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
power that worketh of it ſelfe and without the body, is the power
of reaſon or underſtanding, which if we will we may call the mind.
And if thou yet ſtill doubt thereof, conſider when thou mindeſt a
thing earneſtly what thy body furthereth thy minde therein, &amp; thou
ſhalt perceive that the more fixedly thou thinkeſt upon it, the leſſe
thou ſeeſt the things before thee, and <hi>the more thy minde wandereth
the more thy body reſteth:</hi> as who would ſay that the workings of
the body, are the greateſt hinderance and impediment that can bee
to the peculiar <hi>doings of the minde.</hi> And this ability of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may be likened to a man, which though he have loſt both his
hand and his lute; ceaſeth not therefore to bee a man ſtill, and to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113444:20"/>
doe the true deeds of a man, that is to wit, to diſcourſe of things, to
minde them, to uſe reaſon and ſuch like; yea, and to be both a Luter
and a man as he was afore, notwithſtanding that he cannot put
his Lute-playing in exerciſe for want of inſtruments. Nay, (which
more is) this underſtanding part groweth ſo much the ſtronger
and greater, as it is leſſe occupied and buſied about theſe baſe and
corruptible things, and is <hi>altogether drawn home wholy to it ſelfe,</hi>
as is to be ſeen in thoſe which want their eyes, whoſe mindes are
commonly moſt apt to underſtand, and moſt firme to remember.
Doe we debate of a thing in our ſelves? Neither our body nor out
ſences are buſied about it. Doe we will the ſame? As little doe they
ſtir for that too. To underſtand and to will (which are the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the minde.) the ſoule hath no need of the body, and as for
working and being, they accompany one another ſayth <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
Therefore to continue ſtill in being, the ſoule hath not to doe with
the body, nor any need of the body: but rather to worke well and
to be well, the ſoule ought either to be without the body, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to be utterly unſubject to the body.</p>
            <p>Yea (ſay they) but yet we ſee men forgoe their reaſon, as fools and
melancholie perſons: &amp; ſeeing it is forgon, it may alſo be corrupted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and if corrupted, it may alſo die; for what is death but an utter and
full corruptneſſe? Nay, thou ſhouldeſt ſay rather; I have ſeen divers,
which having ſeemed to have loſt their right wits, have recovered
them again by good diet and medicinable drinks. But had they been
utterly loſt and forgone, no phyſick could have reſtored them again:
and had they been utterly periſhed, the parties themſelves ſhould
have had neither ſenſe nor life remaining. Therefore of neceſſity the
ſoule of them was as ſound as afore. But our ſoules we ſee not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than by the body and by the inſtruments of the bodie as it
were by Spectacles, and our minde which beholdeth and ſeeth
through his imaginations as it were through a cloude, is after a
ſort troubled by the dimming of the ſpectacles, and by the ſmoakie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the imaginations. After that manner the Sun ſeemeth to be
dimmed &amp; eclipſed; &amp; that is but by the coming of the moon or of
ſome clouds between him &amp; us, for in his light there is no abatement
at all. Likewiſe our eyſight conceiveth things according to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles
wherethough it looketh or according to the colour that over
thwarteth the things which it looketh upon. Take away the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments,
and our eyes ſhall ſee cleere, purge away the humors,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113444:20"/>
and our imagination ſhall be pure: and ſo our underſtand ſhall
ſee as bright as it did afore, even as the Sunne ſhineth after the
putting away of the Clowdes. And it fareth not with our Soules
as it doth with our bodies, which after a long ſickneſſe retain ſtill
either a hardneſſe of the Splene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a ſhortneſſe of breath, or a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Rhewme upon the Lungs, or a skarre of ſome great
wound that cannot be worne out becauſe of the breake that was
made in the whole. For neither in their underſtanding, neither in
their willes do our Soules feele any abatement, ſaving that there
abideth ſome maime or blemiſh in the inſtruments; to wit (as I
will declare hereafter) ſo farre forth as it pleaſeth GOD for a iuſt
puniſhment, to put the Soule in ſubjection to the bodie whoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
it was created to have been, becauſe it hath neglected the
will of the Creator, to follow the luſts and likings of the bodie.
This appeareth in Lunaticke folkes and ſuch others, which have
their witts troubled at times and by fitts. For they be not vexed
but at the ſtirring of their humours, being at other times ſober
and well enough ſtayed in their witts, The like is ſeene in them
that have the falling ſickneſſe. For their underſtanding ſeemeth to
be eclipſed, and as it were ſtricken with a Thunderclap, during the
time of their fitts; but afterward they be as diſcreet as though
they ailed nothing. To be ſhort, the body is ſubject to a thouſand
diſeaſes, wherewith we ſee the underſtanding to be no whit alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
becauſe they touch not the inſtruments of the Sence and of
the Imaginations, which move the underſtanding. Troubled it is
in deede by thoſe few things only, which infect the Sence and the
Imagination, which by that meanes report the things unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>whereon the mind debateth.</hi> Therefore ye ſhall never ſee any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
out of his witts or out of his right mind, in whom the Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may not manifeſtly perceive, either ſome default of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
as a miſhapen and miſportioned head; or els an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verabounding
of ſome melancholike humour, that troubled and
marred his bodie afore it troubled or impaired his mind. And like
as the wiſeſt men being deceived by <hi>falſe Spies,</hi> do make wrong
<hi>deliberations,</hi> howbeit yet grounded upon good reaſon, which thing
they could not doe unleſſe they were wiſe in deede: So the reaſon
that is in our mind maketh <hi>falſe diſcourſes,</hi> and gathereth wrong
concluſions, upon the falſe reports of the imagination; which it
could not doe, if it were either diminiſhed or impaired, or done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113444:21"/>
way. Whereunto accordeth this ancient ſaying, <hi>That there be
certain follyes which none but wiſe men can commit, and
certain Errours which none but learned men can fall into:</hi>
becauſe that in ſome caſes, diſcretion and wiſedom are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
in the partie that is to be deceived, even to the intent he
may be deceived; and learning is required in a man that he
may conceive and hold a wrong opinion. As for example, to
beguiled by a doubledealing Spy or by the ſurpriſing of a coſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
letter, belongeth to none but to a wiſe man. For a groſheaded
foole never breaketh his brain about ſuch matters as might bring
him to the making of falſe concluſions by miſtaking likelyhoods in
ſtead of truth. Likewiſe to fall into Hereſie by miſconceiving ſome
high and deepe point, befalleth not to an ignorant perſon; for he is
not of capacitie, neither doth his underſtanding <hi>mount ſo high.</hi>
To be ſhort, <hi>Whoſoever ſayth that mans Soul periſheth with the body,
becauſe it is troubled by the diſtemperature or miſproportionateneſſe of
the body; may as well uphold that the Child in the mothers wombe dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with his mother, becauſe he moveth with her, and is partaker with
her of her harms and throws, by reaſon of the ſtreit conjunction that is
between them; howbeit that many children have lived ſafe and ſound,
notwithſtanding that their mothers have dyed; yea and ſome have
come into the World even by the death of their mothers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas ſome ſay, that becauſe our mind conceiveth not
any thing here, but by helpe of Imagination; therefore when the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination
is gone with the inſtruments whereunto it is tyed, the
Soule cannot work alone by it ſelfe, nor conſequently be alone by it
ſelfe: ſurely it is alone as if they ſhould ſay, that becauſe the Child
being in his mothers wombe taketh nouriſhment of her bloud by
his navill; therefore he cannot live when he is come out her womb,
if his navillſtrings be cut off. Nay contrariwiſe, then is the time
that the mouth, the tongue, and the other parts of the Childe doe
their dutie, which ſerved erſt to no purpoſe, ſaving that they were
prepared for the time to come. <hi>After the ſame manner alſo doe wee
cheriſh our mind by Imagination in this ſecond life; which in the third
life being (as ye would ſay) ſcaped out of priſon, ſhall begin to utter
his operations by himſelfe, and that ſo much the more certainly, for
that it ſhall not be ſubject to falſe reports, nor to the ſences eyther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or outward, but to the very things themſelvs which it ſhall have
ſeen and learned.</hi> To be ſhort, <hi>it ſhall live, but not in priſon; it ſhall</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:113444:21"/>
               <hi>ſee but not through ſpectacles; it ſhall underſtand, but not by reports;
it ſhall liſt, but not by way of luſting:</hi> the infirmity which the body
caſteth upon it as now ſhal then be away: the force which it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
now to the body, ſhall then be more freſh and lively than afore.
Now then notwithſtanding theſe vain reaſons of theirs, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That our ſoule is an underſtanding or reaſonable power; over
the which neither death nor corruption have naturally any power,
although it be fitted to the body to govern it. And if any man doubt
hereof, let him but examine himſelfe, for even his own doubts will
prove it unto him. Or if he will ſtand in contention ſtill, let him fall
to reaſoning with himſelfe: for by <hi>concluding his arguments to prove
his ſoule mortall, he ſhall give judgement himſelfe that it is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</hi>
And if I have left any thing unalleadged which might make to
this purpoſe, (for why may I not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing that even the ſelfeſame
things which I have been able to alleadge on the behalfe of mine
adverſaries, doe drive them thereunto?) let us think alſo that he
which feeleth himſelfe convicted in himſelfe, and for whoſe behoof
and benefit it were greatly, both to believe it and to confeſſe it, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no more diligent proof than hath been made already. But if
any man will yet of ſpight ſtand wilfully ſtill againſt himſelfe, let
him try how he can make anſwer to my foreſaid arguments: and in
the mean while let us ſee what the ſaid opinion of the wiſeſt men,
yea, and of the whole world hath been upon this matter.</p>

            <head type="sub">That the immortality of the Soul hath been taught by the

            <p>SOothly it had been a very hard caſe, if this minde of ours which
ſearcheth ſo many things in nature, had not taken ſome <hi>leaſure
to ſearch it ſelfe</hi> and the nature thereof, and by ſearching attained
to ſome poynt in that behalfe. And therefore as there have at all
times beene men, ſo ſhall wee ſee alſo that men have at all
times believed and admitted the immortality of the ſoule, I ſay not
ſome one man, or ſome one Nation, but the whole world with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
conſent, becauſe all men univerſally and particularly have learned
it in one ſchoole, and at the mouth of one Teacher, namely even
their own knowledge in themſelves. The holy Scripture which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113444:22"/>
teacheth us our ſalvation, uſeth no ſchool arguments to make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that there is a God: and that is becauſe we cannot ſtep out of
our ſelves never ſo little, but we muſt needs finde him preſent to all
our ſences. And it ſeemeth to ſpeake unto us the leſſe expreſſely of the
immortality of our ſoules, ſpecially in the firſt books thereof, becauſe
we cannot <hi>enter into our ſelvs</hi> be it never ſo little, but we muſt needs
perceive it. But in as much as from the one end thereof to the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it declareth unto us the will of God: in ſo doing, it doth us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that it is a thing, <hi>whereof it is not lawfull for us to doubt.</hi>
And whereas it ſetteth forth ſo preciſely from age to age;<note place="margin">The opinion of the Men of old time.</note> the great
and manifold troubles and pains which good and godly men have
ſuffered in indeavouring to follow that will, it ſheweth infalibly that
their ſo doing was in <hi>another reſpect</hi> than for this preſent wretched
life. For who is he that would depart with any piece of his own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in this life, but in <hi>hope</hi> of better things? and what were it for

Scripture, and are <hi>loth to finde</hi> that <hi>thing in the Bible, which is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
there,</hi> not onely in every leaf, but almoſt in every line. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
God created man after the world was fully finiſhed &amp; perfected:
it was as much as if he had brought him into a Theater prepared
for him, howbeit after another ſort than all the other living things
which were to doe him ſervice. As for beaſts, birds, plants, and ſuch
other things, the elements brought them forth, but man received
his ſoule by <hi>inſpiration</hi> from God. Alſo the brute beaſts are put in
ſubjection to man, but man is <hi>in ſubjection onely unto God.</hi> And the
conveying of that good man <hi>Henocke</hi> out of this life for his godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
was to none other end, but <hi>to ſet him in another life void of all

               <note place="margin">The belief of the Patriarks, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>and full of all good.</hi> But when we read the perſecutions of <hi>Noe;</hi>
the overthwartings of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the baniſhment and wayfarings of
<hi>Jacob,</hi> and the diſtreſſes of <hi>Joſeph, Moſes,</hi> and all the reſidew of

truſt and believe</hi> that the <hi>ſoule is immortall,</hi> that there is
another life after this, and that there is a judgement to come. For
had they been of opinion that there is none other life after this; the
<hi>fleſh</hi> would have perſwaded them to have held themſelves in quiet

ſo foorth. So then, although the Scripture ſeeme to conceale it; yet
doth it ſpeake very loude thereof in deede, conſidering that all the
<hi>cryes</hi> of the good and godly, and all the <hi>deſpayres</hi> of the wicked
which it deſcribeth unto us, doe ſound none other things unto us, if
we have cares to heare it. And it may be, that in the ſame reſpect,
this article of the Immortalitie of the Soule was not put into the
ancient Creede of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor alſo peculiarly into the Creede
of us Chriſtians, becauſe we <hi>beleeve beyond reaſon,</hi> and this is
<hi>within the bounds of reaſon;</hi> and whoſoever treateth of <hi>Religion

is builded every whit upon that, as upon a foundation without
the which thoſe things could not ſtand. I will ſpend my goodes or
my life for the maintenance of Iuſtice. What is this Iuſtice but a
vaine name, or to what end have I ſo many reſpects, if I looke for
nothing out of this preſent world here: I will (ſayd a man of olde
time) <hi>rather loſe even the reputation of an honeſt man, thau behave

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his 10. book of Moralls.</note> and the other not. In the tenth book of his

which conſiſteth in <hi>contemplation,</hi> is better than the other; and the
felicity thereto belonging, is peculiarly deſcribed by him in his

it be to a mans ſelfe or towards other men, were elſe a vain thing
and to no purpoſe, but to vex our mindes in this life. In his books

minde</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>may be ſevered from the body, it is not in any wiſe
mingled with it, it is of ſuch ſubſtance as cannot be hurt or wrought
upon, it hath being and continnance actually and of it ſelfe, and even
when it is ſeparated from the body, then is it immortall and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
To be ſhort, it hath not any thing like unto the body. For it is not
any of all thoſe things which have being afore it underſtand them.
And therefore which of all bodily things can it be?</hi> And in another
place he ſayth thus: <hi>As concerning the minde, and the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power, it is not yet ſufficiently apparant what it is, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
it ſeemeth to be another kinde of ſoule, and it is
that onely which can be ſeparated from the corruptible, as the
which is Ayeverlaſting.</hi> To bee ſhort, when as hee putteth
this queſtion, whether a Naturall Philoſopher is to diſpute of
all manner of Soules, or but onely of that Soule which is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:
it followeth that hee granteth that there is ſuch a one.
And again, when as hee maketh this argument, <hi>Looke what
God is everlaſtingly, that are we in poſſibility, according to our
meaſure; but hee is everlaſtingly ſeparated from bodily things,
therefore the time will come that we ſhall be ſo too.</hi> Hee taketh it
that there is an image of God in us, yea even of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which hath continuance of it ſelfe. Very well and rightly
therefore doth <hi>Simplicius</hi> gather thereof, the immortality of the
ſoule.<note place="margin">In the laſt book of the parts of beaſts. In the tenth of his Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalls. In his firſt book of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State.</note> For it dependeth upon this ſeparation, and upon continuance
of being of it ſelfe. Beſides this he ſayth alſo, that hunting of beaſts
is granted to man by the law of nature, becauſe that thereby man
challengeth nothing but that which naturally is his own. But what
right I pray you, <hi>if there be no more in himſelfe than in them?</hi> And
what is there more in him than in them; if they have a ſoule equall
unto his? Hereunto make all his commendations of godlineſſe, of
Religion, of bleſſedneſſe, and of contemplation. For to what end
ſerve all theſe, which doe but cumber us here below? Therefore
ſurely it is to be concluded, that as he ſpake doubtfully in ſome one
place, ſo he both termed and alſo taught to ſpeake better in many
other places, as appeareth by his Diſciple <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

is not any mixture in them, or any compounding that may ſeeme to be

the power of memory, underſtanding, and conceit, to beare in minde

the ſoule. By them the ſoule is overwhelmed, beaten downe, and chaſed
away. It hath not a greater battell, than with that maſſe of fleſh. For

again: <hi>This ſoule cannot be made an Outlaw: for it is a kin to the

Logicke and Mathematicke (ſayth <hi>Zeno</hi>) have not ſo much force
to prove the immortalitie of the ſoule, as this only doing of theirs
hath. Alſo great <hi>Alexander</hi> having taken priſoners ten of their

them to try their wiſedome, whether there were moe men alive or
dead. The Philoſopher anſwered, that there were more alive: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
(ſayd he) <hi>there are none dead.</hi> Ye may well think they gave

which with all their Philoſophie had taught their ſcholer <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

expreſſely concerning the nature of the ſoule, beſides the
things which he hath written diſperſedly heere and there in other

not of their bodies, nor of the ſeede of the Parent, but come
from above, and are as ye would ſay grafted into our bodies by the
hand of God: That the ſoule is partly tyed to the body and to the
inſtruments thereof, and partly franke, free, workfull, and continuing
of it ſelfe; and yet notwithſtanding that it is neither a body nor the
harmonie of the body, but (if we conſider the life and operation
which it giveth to the body) it is after a ſort the perfection [or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the perfector] of the body; &amp; if we have an eye to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
whereby it guydeth the movings and doings of the body; it is
as a Governour of the body: That the further it is withdrawne
from the Sences, the better it diſcourſeth of things; inſomuch that
when it is utterly ſeparated from them, it underſtandeth things
without diſcourſing, reaſoning or debating, yea even in a moment;
becauſe this debating is but a certain <hi>lightening or brightneſſe of
the minde,</hi> which now taketh adviſement in matter whereof it
doubteth, &amp; it doubteth whereſoever the body yeeldeth any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
unto it; but it ſhall neither doubt nor ſeek adviſement any
more when it is once out of the body, but ſhall conceive the truth
without wavering: That the ſoule in the body is not properly
there as in a place, or as in a ground, becauſe it is not contained or
comprehended therein, and may alſo be ſeparated from it; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if a man had eyes to ſee it withall, he ſhould ſee that the bodie
is in the ſoule, as <hi>an acceſſary is in a principall,</hi> or as a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in a container, or a ſheding or liquid thing in a thing that
is not liquid, becauſe the <hi>Soule imbraceth the body,</hi> and quickneth
it, and moveth it equally and alike in all parts. That every abilitie
thereof is in every part of the bodie, as much in one part as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as a whole ſoule in every part; notwithſtanding that every
ſeverall abilitie thereof ſeeme to be ſeverally in ſome particular
member or part, becauſe the inſtruments thereof are there; as the
ſenſitive abilitie ſeemeth to reſt in the head, the irefull in the heart,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113444:29"/>
and the quickning in the liver, becauſe the ſinews, heart-ſtrings,
and veins come from thoſe parts: Whereas the reaſonable pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is not in any part, ſaving ſo far forth as it worketh and hath
his operation there, neither hath it any need of place or inſtrument
for the executing of it ſelfe. And to be ſhort, that the ſoule is a life
by it ſelfe, a life all in one, unpaitable, which cauſeth to grow, and
groweth not it ſelfe; which goeth through the bodie, and yet is
not contained of the body; which uniteth the ſences, and is not
divided by the Sences, and therefore that it is a bodileſſe ſubſtance,
which cannot be touched, neither from within nor from without,
having no need of the body either outwardly or inwardly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
is immortall, divine, yea and <hi>almoſt a very God:</hi> Which
things he proveth by many reaſons, which were too long to be
rehearſed here.<note place="margin">

are paſſed into another world, have their memory ſtill, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that to ſome mens ſeeming, it goe away with the ſences
as the treaſury of the ſences. Howbeit he affirmeth it to be the more
excellent kinde of memory, not that which calleth things again to
minde as already paſt, but that which <hi>holdeth and beholdeth</hi> them
ſtill as always preſent. Of which two ſorts this latter he calleth
Mindfulneſſe. and the other he calleth Remembrance. I will add
but onely one ſentence more of his for a full preſident of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
<hi>The ſoule</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>hath had company with the Gods, and
is immortall, and ſo would we ſay of it (as</hi> Plato <hi>affirmeth) if we ſaw
it faire and cleere. But for as much as we ſee it commonly troubled,
we think it not to be either divine or immortall, howbeit that he which
will diſcerne the nature of a thing perfectly, muſt conſider it in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
own ſubſtance or being, utterly unmingled with any other thing.
For whatſoever elſe is added unto it, doth hinder the perfect diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the ſame. Therefore let everyman behold himſelfe naked,
without any thing ſave himſelfe, ſo as he look upon nothing elſe than
his bare ſoule: and ſurely when he hath viewed himſelfe in his own
nature, meerly as in reſpect of his minde, he ſhall believe himſelfe to
be immortall. For he ſhall ſee that his minde aymeth not properly at
the ſenſible and mortall things, but that by a certain everlaſting
power, it taketh hold of the things that are everlaſting, and of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is poſſible to be conceived in underſtanding: inſomuch that
even it ſelfe becommeth after a ſort a very world of underſtanding
and light.</hi> This is againſt thoſe which pretend a weakneſſe of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:113444:30"/>
the ſoule, by reaſon of the inconveniencies which it indureth very
often in the body.</p>
            <p>Of the ſame opinion are <hi>Numenius, Jamblichus, Porphirius,</hi>
and <hi>Proclus,</hi> notwithſtanding that now and then they paſſe their
bounds, ſuffering their wits to run ryot. For in their Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie
they had none other rule, than onely the drift of their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
It was commonly thought that <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Aphrodiſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
not the immortality of the ſoule,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Aphrodiſe</hi> in his Books of the Soul.</note> becauſe hee defined it to
be the forme of the body, proceeding of the mixture &amp; temperature
of the Elements. Surely theſe words of his doe us to underſtand,
either that he meant to defiue but the ſenſitive life onely (as many
others do) and not the reaſonable ſoule, or elſe that he varieth from
himſelfe in other places. And in very deed he ſayth immediately
afterward, that he ſpeaketh of the things which are ſubject to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
and corruption. But ſpeaking of the ſoule he ſayth it is
ſeparable, unmateriall, unmixed, and voyd of paſſions, unleſſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
we may thinke as ſome doe, that by this ſoule hee mean
but onely God, and not alſo the ſoule that is in us; for the which
thing hee is ſharply rebuked by <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> who notwithſtanding
ſpake never a whit better thereof himſelfe. Howſoever he deale

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of the Manners of the Soul.</note> (who fathereth the cauſes of all
things as much as he can, upon the Elements, and the mixture and
agreeable concord of them) if after his diſputing againſt his own
ſoule, hee bee conſtrained to yield that it is immortall? Surely in
his book concerning the manners of the ſoule, he doth the worſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:113444:30"/>
that he can againſt <hi>Plato:</hi> and in another place he doubteth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be immortall, and whether it have continuance of it ſelfe or
no. Yet notwithſtanding in his book of the doctrine of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
and <hi>Plato,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In his Book of the doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>It muſt needs be granted</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that the
Soule is either a ſheare body, and of the nature of the skie, (as
the Stoicks and</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>himſelfe, are inforced to confeſſe) or elſe
a bodileſſe ſubſtance, whereof the body is, as it were, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
and whereby it hath fellowſhip with other bodies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In his Book of Conception.</note> And
it appeareth that he inclineth to this latter part. For he maketh
the vitall ſpirit to be the excellenteſt of all bodily things, and yet he
granteth the ſoule to be a far more excellent thing than that.
What ſhall we then doe? Let us wey his words ſet down in his
book of the conception of a childe in the mothers wombe. <hi>The
Soule of man</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>is an influence of the univerſall Soule
that diſcendeth from the heavenly Region, a ſubſtance that
is capable of knowledge, which aſpireth always to one ſubſtance
like unto it ſelfe, which leaveth all theſe lower things to ſeeke the
things that are above, which is partaker of the heavenly God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and which by mounttng up to the beholding of things
that are above the heavens, putting it ſelfe into the preſence of

comming from elſe where than of the body, and mounting ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the body,<note place="margin">The univerſall conſent.</note> ſhould in the end die with the body, becauſe it uſeth
the ſervice of the body?</p>
            <p>Now hereunto I could adde infinite other ſayings of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Authors both <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Philoſophers, Poets, and
Orators from age to age, wherein they treat of the judgement to
come, of the reward of good men. of the puniſhment of evill men, of
<hi>Paradiſe and of Hell,</hi> which are <hi>appendants</hi> to the <hi>immortality</hi> of
the Soule: but as now I will but put the reader in minde of them
by the way, reſerving them to their peculiar places. To be ſhort,
let us run at this day from Eaſt to Weſt,<note place="margin">In the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, Azo. 25. and 42.</note> and from North to
South, I ſay not among the <hi>Turks, Arabians</hi> or <hi>Perſians,</hi> (for
their <hi>Alcoran</hi> teacheth them that mans ſoule was breathed into
him of God,<note place="margin">It appeareth by the ſtories of the Eaſt &amp; Weſt Indies.</note> and conſequently that it is uncorruptible) but even a
mong the moſt barbarous, ignorant, &amp; beaſtly people of the World,
I meane the very <hi>Caribies</hi> and <hi>Canniballs,</hi> and we ſhall finde this
beliefe received and imbraced of them all. Which giveth us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that it is not a doctrine invented by ſpeculations of ſome
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:113444:31"/>
Philoſophers, conveyed from Countrey to Countrey by their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
perſwaded by likelyhoods of reaſons, or (to be ſhort) entered
into mans wit by his ears: but a <hi>native knowledge,</hi> which every
man <hi>findeth and readeth in himſelfe</hi> which he carryeth everywhere
about with himſelfe, and which is as eaſie to be perſwaded unto all
ſuch as <hi>view themſelves in themſelves,</hi> as it is eaſie to perſwade a
man that never ſaw his own face, to believe that he hath a face, by
cauſing him to behold himſelfe in a glaſſe.</p>
            <p>There remain yet two opinions to bee confuted.<note place="margin">Againſt <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoes.</hi>
               </note> The one is
the opinion of <hi>Averrhoes,</hi> and the other is the opinion of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of <hi>Aphrodiſe,</hi> who affirme themſelves to hold both of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;</hi>
namely in that they uphold that there is but one univerſall
reaſonable ſoule or mind, which worketh all our diſcourſes in us,
howbeit diverſly in every ſeverall perſon. And this thing (if wee
believe <hi>Averrhoes</hi>) is done according to the diverſity of the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies
or imaginations wherewith the minde is ſerved as with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.
But if we believe <hi>Alexander,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bear theſe terms &amp; their ſignifications in Mind, for all the diſcourſe here enſuing.</note> it is done according to
the diverſities of the capable minde, as they terme it, that is to ſay,
of the ability or capability that is in men to underſtand things, by
receiving the impreſſion of the univerſall minde that worketh into
every of them which in reſpect thereof is called of them the <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
Soothly theſe opinions are ſuch as may be diſproved in one
word. For this onely one minde, whether in poſſibility or in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
could not have received or imprinted in every man one ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
common beliefe and conceit of the immortality of the Soule,
in ſo great diverſity of imaginations, and in ſo many Nations, as
we ſee doe believe it, conſidering that the very ſame conceit is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
repugnant againſt it. Nay, it may well be ſayd that <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoes</hi>
and <hi>Alexander</hi> had very divers conceits and imaginations
one from another, and very contrary to all other mens, ſeeing they
had ſo diverſe and contrary opinions imprinted either in their mind
or in their imagination. Howbeit for as much as there may be ſome,
that will make a doubt of it; let us examine them ſeverally yet more
adviſedly.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Averrhoes</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> third Book of the Soul.</note> Firſt, <hi>Averrhoes</hi> will needs bear <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> on hand,
that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is of that opinion. Let us ſee how this furniſe of
his can agree with the propoſitions which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath left us.
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> telleth us that the ſoule is knit to the body as the forme
or ſhape to the matter; that the ſoule hath three chiefe powers,
namely, of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſenſe, and of underſtanding; and that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:113444:31"/>
part containeth in his power both the other two powers,
as a five ſquare containeth both a foreſquare and a Triangle.
Whereupon it followeth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his ſecond Book of the Soul.</note> that if any one of the three powers of the
ſoule be joyned to the body as a forme to the matter; all the three
be joyned ſo to, as which are all in one ſoule as in their root. Now
<hi>Averrhoes</hi> neither can nor will deny that the powers of growing
and of perceiving by the ſences are joyned after that manner to the
body; and therefore it followeth that the underſtanding power is ſo
joyned alſo, and conſequently that according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as every
body hath his forme,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his firſt Book of the Soul.</note> ſo every body hath his ſoule. The ſame <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>
findeth fault with the former Philoſophers for holding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that a ſoule might paſſe out of one man into another: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(ſayth he) that every certain ſoule muſt needs be appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
and appointed to ſome one certain body. Now looke by
what ſoule a man liveth, by the ſame ſoule doth he underſtand:
for it is but one ſoule indewed with three divers abilities, as hee
himſelfe teacheth openly. One underſtanding or minde therefore,
muſt (according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) worke but in one ſeverall body, and
not in many bodies. Alſo according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> a man and a beaſt
agree in this, that both of them have one ſenſitive power, and one
ſelfeſame imagination of things perceived by the ſences, and that
they differ in this, that man hath yet further <hi>a minde and reaſon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the beaſt, which thing the beaſt hath not. Now if this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
or minde be without the man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the ſunne is without
the chamber, that it ſhineth into and inlighteneth, then cannot he
be called reaſonable, or indowed with underſtanding, neither doth
he conſequently differ from a beaſt. For the difference muſt be <hi>in
nature,</hi> and not in <hi>accident.</hi> And ſo ſhould it inſue that <hi>Ariſtotles</hi>
foreſaid definition of a man is falſe, as if he ſhould define a chamber
by the ſhining of the ſunne into it: Or ſay that a dog differeth
not from a man in kinde; yea, and that beaſts are capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
for as much as they have imagination ready aforehand to
receive the influence thereof as well as we. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is always
one in his defining both of beaſt and of man; and <hi>Averrhoes</hi> alſo
holdeth himſelfe to it, without doubting thereof at all. This conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
therefore cannot in any wiſe be upheld by ſuch grounds.</p>
            <p>Again, if there be not in every ſeverall man a ſeverall minde,
but onely one univerſall minde common to all men, which becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
divers by the onely diverſity of our imaginations: Then in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:113444:32"/>
reſpect that we have ſundry imaginations, we ſhall by ſundry li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
wights; and in reſpect that we have all but one minde, we ſhall
be all but one man. For man is not man in reſpect of the ſenſitive
power, but in reſpect of the reaſonable part which is the minde. But
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> granteth that we be not onely divers living wights, but
alſo divers men. And therefore he muſt needs mean alſo, that wee
have not onely divers imaginations, but alſo divers minds. Now
beſides many other reaſons that might be aleadged, yee might add
this alſo, That otherwiſe <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Moralls and his diſcourſes
concerning Juſtice, Freewill, the Immortality of the ſoule, the
happie bliſſe, the reward of the good, and the pains of the wicked,
were utterly <hi>fruitleſſe</hi> and to no purpoſe: For as our fancies or
imaginations did come and goe, ſo would all thoſe things come and
goe likewiſe, and ſo ſhould they have no continuance of themſelves,
but onely be as a ſhadow and vain phantaſie. But let <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
(for he hath wrong) and let us come to the matter it ſelfe. The
Philoſophers doe ordinarily make a double minde; the one which
they call <hi>poſſible or impoſſible,</hi> which is capable and of <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bility
to underſtand things; and this they liken to a <hi>ſmooth table;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they call <hi>working on workefull,</hi> which bringeth the ability into
act, whereas notwithſtanding they be not two mindes, but two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
abilities of onely one minde. Now, as for this ability or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of underſtanding, we affirme it to be in the ſoule of every
man. Contrariwiſe, <hi>Averrhoes</hi> affirmed onely one univerſall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
minde to be ſhed abroad every where throughout all men; &amp;
that the ſame is diverſly perfected and brought into act in every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
man, according to the diverſity of the imaginations which
the man conceiveth, even by the help or influence of the ſaid uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
workfull minde, which he ſayth is alſo a ſubſtance ſevered,
from man, and (in reſpect of the underſtanding in poſſibility) is as
the ſunne is to the ſight of our eyes, and the underſtanding in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
is to the imaginations as the ſight is unto colours. Now,
I demand firſt of all, whether theſe uniuerſall minds of his, bee
ſubſtances created or uncreated. If they be created, where becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
then his concluſion, That the world is without beginning,
and without ending, ſeeing that he will have them to be continued
everlaſtingly in all men that have been, are, or ſhall be? If they bee
uncreated, how can ſo excellent ſubſtances be made ſubject to our
fond imaginations, to yield influence into them at their pleaſures?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:113444:32"/>
Or rather how happeneth it that they correct them not? How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
it that they leave them in ſuch errors, yea even in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of themſelves, ſeeing that by the erring of the imaginations,
the very underſtanding and reaſon themſelves muſt alſo needs be
ſo often beguiled? Again, as concerning theſe ſubſtances, which
extend into ſo many places; are they Bodies or Spirits? How can
they be bodies, ſeeing they be <hi>in infinite places at one inſtant,</hi> and
<hi>doe infinite things,</hi> yea, and flat contraries? And if they be Spirits,
doth it not follow therupon, that they be wholy in all men &amp; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in every man; that is to ſay, that every man hath them <hi>wholy to
himſelfe?</hi> And therefore that if they be deceived by the fantaſie of
any one man, they be conſequently deceived in all men? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
comes it then, that one man overcommeth his imaginations,
and another man not? Or that one man reſiſteth them, and another
ſuffereth himſelfe to be carried away by them? Moreover, who can
deny that a man willeth things, whereof he hath underſtanding;
and likewiſe that he willeth ſome things which he underſtandeth not: and that he underſtandeth ſome things which he willeth not?
And alſo that he willeth things even contrary to his appetites, and
concludeth oftentimes contrary to his imaginations, as commeth
to paſſe in dreams and in looking-glaſſes; which thing the brute
beaſts doe not? When a man willeth contrary to his appetites,
willeth he not contrary to his ſences, yea, and contrary to his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
too: for what els is fantaſie or imagination, than the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
backe</hi> of the fences: And if this workfull underſtanding
be the only worker in his poſſible underſtanding by meane of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;
how commeth it to paſſe that a man willeth contrary to
his imagination: Againe, when either in dreaming or in debating,
reaſon concludeth cleane contrary to that which fancie or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
offereth; whereof commeth it that a man is contrary to himſelf<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
or that the deede is contrary both to that which <hi>imprinted it,</hi> and to
that wherein it is imprinted? Alſo what els is imagaination (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the opinion of <hi>Averrhoes,</hi>) than a certain operation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the bodie, ſteaming up from the Hart to the Braine: And
on the contrary part who can ſay nay, but that the Will and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
are able to performe their operations without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of the body,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his tenth Book of Supernaturals</note> ſeeing that a man doth both will and debate
things that are moſt repugnant to the body: Yea and that (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>
ſayth) thoſe be not actions which paſſe into the outward
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:113444:33"/>
man, but thoſe which abide within &amp; make perfect the inner man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And who can make Will and Vnderſtanding to be things depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon imagination, ſeeing that both waking and ſleeping and
all manner of ways els, they dayly utter infinite iudgements and
determinations againſt it: Now, if we have nothing in us above
Imagination: then conſidering that we doe both will and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
it muſt needes be that this power or abilitie to will and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
is <hi>ſhed into us from without.</hi> And if it but only one u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally
in all men; then ſeeing that the actions thereof are execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without the imagination, without the ſences, and without the
inſtruments of the bodie, yea and againſt them: it followeth that it
willeth and underſtandeth in us whatſoever it liketh and liſteth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
even in <hi>deſpite</hi> of all impediments and lets of the bodie; and that as
it is but one, ſo it ſhall will but one ſelfeſame thing, and likewiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
underſtand but one ſelfeſame thing in all men. For if (as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
confeſſeth) our imaginations make not our will and reaſon
ſubject unto them; much leſſe doe they make the foreſayd univerſall
mind ſubject to them as <hi>Averrhoes</hi> pretendeth. But now contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe
we ſee therebe as many Willes as men, yea even in one
matter; and that the underſtandings of men are not onely divers,
but alſo contrarie. It followeth then that every particular perſon
hath in that behalfe a particular ſubſtance, which willeth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth,
franke and free from all imaginations whenſoever it
liſteth to <hi>retyre into it ſelfe;</hi> and not that there is but one univerſall
mind which willeth and underſtandeth all things in all men. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this; by the iudgement of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> as I ſayd afore, this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
mind could not worke will and underſtanding inus: for to
will and underſtand (ſayth he) are operations that paſſe not into
the matter nor into the outward thing, but abide ſtil in the worker,
that is to ſay in the mind, as actions and perfections thereof.</p>
            <p>Let us yet againe take of that which hath bin ſayd afore. If the
ſayd univerſall only one working mind, have wrought from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
in the ſayd univerſall only one capable mind, by the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
of men: then hath the knowledge of all things bin ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
imprinted in the ſayd capable mind; for it ſhall evermore have
brought the abilitie into act: And therwithall, the working and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the thing that is everlaſting, ſhall have depended upon a
thing that is temporall; which is unpoſſible. And although <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoes</hi>
ſuppoſed not the World to be everlaſting: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:113444:33"/>
the ſaid capable minde which hath been ſet awotke ſo many
hundred years, by ſo many imaginations of men, and in ſo many
ſundry Nations, could not now meet with any new thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it had not the knowledge afore. For this capable mind (ſayth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verrhoes</hi>)
is a certain ſpirituall ſubſtance, which ſpreadeth it ſelfe
forth into all men and into all ages, and the nature of ſuch ſort of
ſubſtances is to be all in the whole, and all in every part thereof.
For they be not tyed to any one place, but are whereſoever they
worke, and their working is in reſpect of the whole, and not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of any one part, foraſmuch as they be undividable. Therefore
it ſhould follow by his opinion (as I have ſayd afore) that the one
univerſall capable minde is and worketh whole &amp; unparted in every
man. And if it be ſo, then is that being of it there, not in way of meer
ability or poſſibility onely, but in way of operation and perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working,
as a wicked ſpirit is in a witch, in a Pythoneſſe or in a
poſſeſſed perſon: which ſpirit (were he poſſeſſed of the man as he
himſelfe poſſeſſeth the man, (after which manner <hi>Averrhoes</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
us to poſſeſſe the underſtanding in poſſibility, by our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;)
would make the man capable of all that ever the Spirit
himſelfe knoweth or is. Whereupon it will follow, that this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in poſſibility, ſhall everlaſtingly in all men from their
very birth, actually underſtand and know all things that all men
underſtand, as well in the old as the young, and in the ignorant as
the skilfull; ſo as wee ſhall have no more need of ſences; nor of
imagination to underſtand withall. To be ſhort, although <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoes,</hi>
admitteth not the World to be without beginning: yet at
leaſtwiſe he will not deny, but that [by his reckoning] they which
come into the world at this day, ſhould come far more skilfull
then all their predeceſſors, and the children of them more skilfull
then their fathers, and the offspring of thoſe children more skilfull
then thoſe children themſelves, and ſo forth on, becauſe they ſhould
ſucceed in the knowledge continued throughout all ages. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it will alſo inſue, that all Sciences ſhall be equall in all men
that make profeſſion of them. As for example, we will ſpeak here,
but of ſome one ſpeciall Science, as Grammer and Arithmetick,
Now if there be any diverſity in the skill thereof, that diverſity
cannot come but of the diverſity of the ſubject or ground wherein
the skill is. Now the ground of the skill is the capacity of the
minde or underſtanding, (which <hi>Averrhoes</hi> ſuppoſeth to be but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:113444:34"/>
one, common to all men) and not the Imagination, which is but a
reflexion or rebounding backe of the Sence. And ſo foraſmuch as
there is (by his ſaying) but one ground in all men; it followeth that
the knowledge or skill of this or that Science muſt needes be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
and alike in all men: or els that if it be not equall, but doe vary,
as we ſee it doth in divers degrees; then the ſame varying or
diverſitie happeneth through the diverſitie of the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the skill is, and conſequently that there is one particular under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
or <hi>one peculiar mind</hi> in every man, and not one univerſall
mind common to all men. Alſo it is a generall rule, that the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of a thing hath not the thing afore he receive it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his third book of the Soule.</note> For (as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
ſayth) that which is to receive a thing, muſt needes be firſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
voyde of the thing which it receiveth. Now afore that our
Sence and Imagination had any being at all, this univerſall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
mind had received and poſſeſſed all things aforehand; and not
only received them, but alſo kept them together. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
himſelfe ſayth, that manner of mind is the place of all under kinds and
ſortes of things, and thereto hath no leſſe power than the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
to reteine whatſoever the Sences receive. In vaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhould that univerſall mind underſtand by our Imaginations,
conſidering that it underſtandeth by it ſelfe: in vaine likewiſe
ſhould the Imaginations imprint thoſe things in it, which were
imprinted in it ſo long afore: and in vaine is <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> ſetting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe
of a workfull underſtanding, which ſhould bring our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in abilitie, from poſſibilitie into action; if the ſayd onely
one vniverſall mind or underſtanding be perfect of it ſelfe from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting,
as it followeth to be upon the opinion of <hi>Averrhoes.</hi>
Neither is it to ſayd, that although the conceivable underkinds
of things have been imprinted everlaſtingly in the ſayd univerſall
mind; yet notwithſtanding there needed and Imagination for the
underſtanding of them, as there needeth now whenſoever we will
uſe the things that we have ſeene or learned afore. For by that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
to learne all manner of Sciences, we needed no more but
to bethinke us by imagination, of the things that were already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
in the ſayd only univerſall one mind, as we doe the things
that have bene printed ſometime in our memories, and are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſlipped out of our remembrance; and ſo might we our ſelves
learne all ſciences without a teacher, becauſe that in the ſayd uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
mind of ours, we ſhould have all the skill that ever any
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:113444:34"/>
man had attained to, in like manner as the perſon that hath once
had the skill of Arithmetick or Coſmographie throughly ſettled in
his mind, needeth no teacher to teach it him againe, but onely to
overturn his owne imagination, and to ſearch his memorie for the
finding againe of that which he had layd up there. Now we knowe
that whoſoever learneth nothing, knoweth nothig, and that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
he which moſt ſtudyeth, moſt learneth: and that all the toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and turmoyling of a mans owne imagination that can be all
his life long, will never make him to attaine of himſelfe to ſo much
as the very principles of the leaſt ſcience that is. By reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it followeth, That we have not the skill of any ſcience in us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
we either be taught it or find it out by beating our wits about
it: and that our imagination ſerveth not to revive the Sciences
in us, but to bring them into us, and to plant them in us, And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as all the Sciences ſhould be in all men from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
if there were but one univerſall mind in all men, [which is
not ſo] it followeth that there is in every particular perſon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and peculiar mind, and not any one univerſall mind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all men. Moreover, our mind attaineth after a ſort to the
underſtanding of it ſelfe: which thing it could not doe in very deede,
if there were but one univerſall mind common to all men. For too
underſtand it ſelfe, it muſt needes worke upon it ſelfe. But if we
beleeve <hi>Averrhoes,</hi> our mind ſhall but onely be wrought upon
and receive into it from the Imagination, as a Window recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
light from the Sunne. Againe, the capacity of the univerſall
underſtanding in poſſibilitie, could not doe that. For it behoved it
to have ſome other thing beſides itſelfe, to bring it ſelfe into action.
And ſurely Imagination could not helpe it, for it <hi>doth but offer up</hi>
the ſenſible things unto it, and attaineth not ſo farre as to the things
that are to be diſcerned by drift of reaſon. Yet notwithſtanding we
underſtand that we underſtand, and we reaſon and iudge both of
our Imagination, and alſo of our reaſoning and underſtanding it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
The thing then which doth <hi>ſo enter and pearce into itſelfe,</hi> is
another manner of power than an Imagination, or that an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
underſtanding in poſſibilitie. What is to be ſayd to this, that of
one ſelfeſame Imagination, one ſelfeſame perſon concludeth now
after one ſort, and by-and-by after in another ſort; and thereout of
draweth both contrarie arguments and contrarie determinations:
or that divers perſon by divers imaginations doe cloſe together in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:113444:35"/>
one will and one minde? Is it poſſible that this ſhould proceed of
an everlaſting ſubſtance in one ſelfe ſame perſon, ſeeing that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſſe
is not ſubject to any change of time or place? Or that
it ſhould proceed of any one ſelfeſame ſubſtance in many men, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the imaginations of them be ſo divers one from another?
at leaſt wiſe if the ſaid ſubſtance work not but by ſuch inſtruments?</p>
            <p>As touching the opinion of <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Aphrodiſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Againſt <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> of <hi>Aphro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diſe.</hi>
               </note> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
a certain univerſall working mind that imprinteth things
in the underſtanding in poſſibility, that is to ſay, in every mans ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
capacity, and bringeth it forth into action: the moſt part
of the reaſons alleaged afore againſt <hi>Averrhoes,</hi> will alſo ſerve
againſt him. Howbeit for as much as by this workfull minde, he
ſeemeth to mean God himſelfe, there is thus much more ro be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto it. That God who is altogether good, and altogether wiſe,
would not imprint in our minde the fond and wicked conceits
which we finde there, nor leave ſo great ignorance and darkneſſe
as we feele there, but would in all men overcome the infection
which the body bringeth: and although he inſpired not all men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
with his gracious gifts, according to the diverſity of their
capacities after the manner of a planed Table, yet would he not at
leaſtwiſe print the World with ſo many falſe Portratures and
Trains, as every one of us may perceive to be in our ſelves.
Again, were there any ſuch inſpiration or influence, it ſhould be
either continuall or but by times. If continuall or everlaſting, wee
ſhould without labour and without cunning underſtand all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our imagination offereth unto us. And if it be but at times,
then ſhould it not lie in us to liſt or to underſtand any thing at all,
though we would never ſo fain. For contrariwiſe, wee have much
adoe to underſtand ſome things, ſo as wee muſt be fain to <hi>win
them from our ignorance by piecemeale,</hi> and there be ſome other
things, which we underſtand by and by as ſoon as they be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, and when we liſt our ſelves, There is then in us a power of
Underſtanding, though very feeble; but yet never the later obedient
to our will: which thing cannot be fathered upon God. Alſo if there
be but onely one minde working in all men, there ſhall be but one
ſelfeſame underſtanding in all men, I meane naturally, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that it differ in degrees. For into what place ſoever the
Sunne doth ſhead his beams, he doth both inlighten it and heat it,
howbeit diverſly according to the nature and condition of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:113444:35"/>
and things that receive him, ſome more, and ſome leſſe, ſome
brighter, and ſome dimlyer. But howſoever the caſe ſtand, his
light yieldeth no darkneſſe, nor his heat any cold. So then if the
diverſities of mens imaginations do cauſe diverſities of effects in
the inſpiration or influence that floweth into the capacitie of our
underſtanding; ſurely it muſt needes be after this manner, namely
that one man ſhall underſtand one ſelfeſame thing more, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man leſſe; but not in that any man ſhall take untruth for truth,
unright for right, or one thing for another. Now we ſee unto how
many errors wee be ſubject, I mean not in ſuch things as this
namely, that one man ſeeth better a far off, and another better at
hand; but that one man ſeeth white and another ſeeth black (which
are things contrary) in one ſelfeſame ground and at one ſelfeſame
time. It followeth therefore that divers and ſundrie mindes doe
worke in divers perſons, and not one ſelfeſame minde in all perſons.
By force of which reaſons and of ſuch others, I ſay that every man
ſhall finde in himſelfe and of himſelfe, that every man hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſoule by himſelfe, that is to ſay, a ſpirituall ſubſtance united
to his body, which in reſpect of giving life to the body is as the
forme thereof, and in reſpect of giving reaſon, is as the guide of our
actions: That in every man there is a certain <hi>Sunbeam of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
whereby they conceive things and debate upon them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through
it commeth to paſſe, that often times they agree both in
the reaſon it ſelfe which is one, and in the manifeſt grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in whatſoever dependeth evidently upon the ſame: That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man hath alſo a peculiar body by himſelfe, and likewiſe pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
complexion, humours, imaginations, education, cuſtome and
trade of life: whereof it commeth that every man takes a diverſe
way, yea, and that one ſelfeſame perſon ſwarveth diverſly from the
unity of reaſon whereof the path is but one, and the ways to ſtray
from it are infinite: That this Sunbeam of reaſon which ſhineth
and ſheadeth it ſelfe from our minde, is properly that underſtanding
which is termed, <hi>The underſtanding in ability or poſſibility,</hi>
which is increaſed and augmented by all the things which it ſeeth,
heareth, or lighteth upon, like fire, which gathereth increaſe of
ſtrength by the abundance of the fewell that is put upon it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
after a ſort infinite by ſpreading it ſelfe abroad: Alſo it is
the ſame which otherwiſe we call <hi>the Memory of underſtanding,
or mindefull Memory,</hi> and it is nothing elſe but an abundance of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:113444:36"/>
Reaſon, and as it were a hoorder up of the continuall influence of
the Mind: That the Mind from whence this floweth as from his
ſpring, is properly that which they the ſayd <hi>Averrhoes</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
do terme the <hi>working or workfull Mind,</hi> which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
power or force that can skill to extend reaſon from one thing
to another, and to proceede from things ſenſible to things unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
from things movable to things unmovable, from bodily to
ſpirituall, from effects to cauſes, and from beginnings to ends by
the meane cauſe. <hi>This Mind is in reſpect of Reaſon, as cunning
is in reſpect of an Inſtrument or toole;</hi> and Reaſon, as in reſpect of
imagination and of the things that are ſenſible, is as an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or toole in reſpect of the matter or ſtuffe that it workes upon:
Or to ſpeake more fitly, this Mind is unto Reaſon, as the mover
of a thing is to the thing that is movable, and Reaſon is to her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
as the movable thing is to the thing whereunto it is moved.
For to reaſon or debate, is nothing els but to proceed from a thing
that is underſtoode, to a thing that is not underſtoode, of purpoſe to
underſtand it: and the underſtanding thereof is a reſting that inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
upon it, as a ſtaying or reſting after moving: That both of
them as well the one as the other, are but onely one ſelfeſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
&amp; like as a man, both when he moveth, and when he reſteth
is all one and the ſame man, or as the power that moveth the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
is one ſelfeſame ſtill, both when it ſtirreth them, and when
it holdeth them ſtill, ſo the reaſonable or underſtanding ſoule that
is in every man, is but onely one ſelfeſame ſubſtance bodileſſe and
immortall, executing his powers partly of it ſelfe, and partly by
our bodies. And ſeeing that <hi>Averrhoes</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> make ſo
great eſtimation and account of the effects which are wrought in
us, that they be inforced to attribute them to ſome uncorruptible
and everlaſting minde; let us take of them, that in very truth the
thing which worketh ſo great wonders in the body, can be neither
ſence, nor body, nor imagination, but a divine, uncorruptible and
immortall minde, as they themſelves ſay.</p>
            <p>But let us learn the thing of more then them, which all wiſe men
teach us, and which every of us can learne of himſelfe; namely that
this underſtanding or minde is not one univerſall thing as the
ſunne is that ſhineth into all the windows of a Citie, but rather,
a particular ſubſtance in every ſeverall man, as a light to lead him
in the darkneſſe of this life; for ſurely it was no more difficultie to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:113444:36"/>
the everlaſting GOD, to create many ſundry ſoules, that every
man might have one ſeverally alone by himſelfe, than to have crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but onely one ſoule for all men together. But it was far more
for his glory, to be known, praiſed, and exalted of many ſoules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yea and more for our welfare to praiſe, exalt, and know him, yea,
and to live of our ſelves both in this life, and in the life to come:
then if any other univerſall ſpirit, ſoule or minde whatſoever, ſhould
have lived and underſtood either in us or after us. Now then for
this matter let us conclude, both by reaſon and by antiquity, and
by the knowledge that every of us hath of himſelfe; That the ſoule
and the body be things divers: that the ſoule is a ſpirit and not a
body: That this ſpirit hath in man three abilities or powers,
whereof two be exerciſed by the body, and the third worketh of
it ſelfe without the body: That theſe three abilities are in the one
onely ſoule as in their root: whereof two doe ceaſe whenſoever the
body faileth them, and yet notwithſtanding the ſoule abideth whole
without a batement of any of her powers, as a craftſman continueth
a craftſman though he want tools to work withall: And finally, that
this ſoule is a ſubſtance that continueth of it ſelfe, and is unmateriall
and ſpirituall, over the which neither death nor corruption can
naturally have any power.</p>
            <p>And for a concluſion of all that ever I have treated of hitherto
in this book, let us maintain, That there is but onely one God,
who by his own goodneſſe and wiſdome is the Creator and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the world &amp; of all that is therein: That in the world he
created Man after his own image as in reſpect of minde, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the image of his other creatures as in reſpect of life, ſenſe, and
moving, mortall ſo far forth as he holdeth the likeneſſe of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and immortall ſo far forth as hee beareth the image of the
Creator: That is to wit, in his ſoule: <hi>That he which goeth out of
himſelfe to ſee the world, doth forthwith ſee that there is a God,</hi> for
his works declare him every where: That hee which will yet ſtill
doubt thereof, needeth but to <hi>enter into himſelfe,</hi> and he ſhall <hi>meet
him there,</hi> for he ſhall finde there a power which he ſeeth not: That
he which believeth there is one God, believeth himſelfe to be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall;</hi>
for ſuch conſideration could not light into a mortall nature:
and that he which believeth himſelf to be immortal, believeth that
there is a God, for without the unutterable power of the one God,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113444:37"/>
the mortall and immortall could never joyne together: That he
which ſeeth the order of the world, the proportion of man, and the
harmonie that is in either of them compounded of ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries,
cannot doubt that there is a Providence for the nature
which hath furniſhed them therewith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be unfurniſhed therof
it ſelfe; but as it once had a care of them, ſo can it not ſhake off the
ſame care from them. Thus have we three Articles which follow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeably
one another. Inſomuch that he which proveth any
one of them, doth prove them all three, notwithſtanding that
I have treated of every of them ſeverally by it ſelfe. Now
let us pray the everlaſting God, that we may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie
him in his works in this world, and
he voutſafe of his mercie to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
us one day in the
World to come.
