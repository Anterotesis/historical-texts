            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SIX SERIOVS
QVAERIES
Concerning the KINGS Triall by the New High Court of Juſtice.</head>
            <p>1. WHether a <hi>King</hi> of three diſtinct <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> can be condemned and executed by one <hi>kingdome</hi> alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the concurrent <hi>conſent,</hi> or againſt the <hi>judgement</hi> of the other two?</p>
            <p>2. Whether, if the <hi>King</hi> be indicted or arraigned of <hi>high treaſon,</hi> he ought not <hi>to be tryed by his Peeres?</hi> and
whether thoſe who are now nominated to try him, or any others within the kingdome, be his Peeres?</p>
            <p>3. Whether if the <hi>King</hi> be triable in any <hi>Court,</hi> for any <hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt the <hi>kingdome,</hi> he ought not to
be tryed onely in full <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the moſt ſolemne and publique manner, <hi>before all the Members of both Houſes,</hi> in as honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a way, as <hi>Strafford</hi> was, in the beginning of this <hi>Parliament?</hi> And whether he ought not to have <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>time</hi> to make
his <hi>full defence,</hi> and the benefit of his <hi>learned Councell,</hi> in all matters of <hi>Law,</hi> that may ariſe, in or about his <hi>triall,</hi> or in <hi>demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
to the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of this <hi>illegall new Court,</hi> as <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Canturbury</hi> had?</p>
            <p>4. Whether one <hi>eight part</hi> onely of the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Commons houſe,</hi> meeting in the Houſe, under the <hi>Armies force,</hi> when
all the reſt of the <hi>Members</hi> are forcibly <hi>restrained, ſecluded,</hi> or <hi>ſcared</hi> away by the <hi>Armies violence,</hi> and repreſenting not above
one <hi>eight part</hi> of the <hi>Counties, Cities,</hi> and <hi>Boroughs</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> without the <hi>conſent</hi> and againſt the <hi>Vote</hi> of the <hi>majority of
the Members,</hi> excluded and chaſed away, and of the <hi>Houſe of Peeres,</hi> by any pretext of <hi>Authority, Law,</hi> or <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> can erect a
<hi>New great Court of Iuſtice</hi> to try the <hi>King,</hi> in whom all the reſt of the <hi>Members, Peeres</hi> and <hi>kingdome</hi> (being farre the <hi>Major
part</hi>) have a <hi>greater intereſt</hi> then they? Whether ſuch an <hi>high Court</hi> can be erected without an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> or at leaſt
an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>both Houſes,</hi> and a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> under the <hi>Great Seale</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> And if not, whether this can be properly called
a <hi>Court of Iuſtice?</hi> and whether it be <hi>ſuperiour</hi> or <hi>inferiour</hi> to thoſe <hi>who erected</hi> it? who either cannot or dare not try and condemn
the <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Commons houſe;</hi> though they now ſtile it <hi>The Supreame authority of the kingdom;</hi> And whether all who ſhall <hi>ſit</hi>
as <hi>Iudges,</hi> or <hi>act</hi> as <hi>Officers</hi> in it, towards the <hi>depoſing</hi> or <hi>taking</hi> away <hi>the Kings life,</hi> be not really guilty of <hi>high Treaſon,</hi> and all
thoſe who were <hi>aiding</hi> or <hi>aſſenting</hi> to the <hi>erection</hi> thereof in ſuch an <hi>irregular manner,</hi> by the Law, and ſtatutes of this Realm?</p>
            <p>5. VVhether thoſe who are <hi>profeſsed Enemies</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> and by their <hi>Remonſtrances, Speeches</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> profeſſe <hi>they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
his blood and ſeeke his life,</hi> can either in <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Conſcience</hi> be reputed <hi>competent
Judges</hi> to try him for <hi>his life?</hi> It being a <hi>juſt
exception</hi> to any <hi>Iury-man,</hi> who is to try the <hi>baſeſt</hi> or <hi>pooreſt felon,</hi> and a <hi>legal chalenge</hi> for which he muſt be <hi>withdrawne;</hi> that
he is a <hi>profeſſed enemy and proſecutor</hi> who ſeekes his life, and therefore no <hi>lawfull</hi> nor <hi>indefferent trier</hi> of him for it.</p>
            <p>6. Whether the <hi>triall</hi> and <hi>taking away</hi> of the <hi>Kings life</hi> by ſuch an illegall and arbitrary <hi>high Court of Juſtice,</hi> as this, will
not prove a moſt dangerous inlet, to the <hi>abſoluteſt tiranny and bloodieſt butchery</hi> ever yet heard off or practized in this, or any other
Nation? and a ready way to teach us, how <hi>to chop</hi> of <hi>one anothers heads;</hi> till we are all <hi>deſtroyed?</hi> For if they may take away
the <hi>Kings head</hi> in it without, and againſt all rules of <hi>Law:</hi> then by the ſame or ſtronger reaſon, they may in like manner <hi>chop off</hi>
the heads of any <hi>Nobleman, Peere, Member, Gentleman,</hi> or <hi>inferiour Subiect</hi> for any <hi>imaginary treaſon</hi> or <hi>offence,</hi> and confiſcate
their <hi>estates,</hi> there being no aſſurance they will ſtop at the Kings; And if thoſe who are confeſſed to be the <hi>Maiority</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
