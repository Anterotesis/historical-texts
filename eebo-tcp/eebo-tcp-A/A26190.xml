            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Fourteenth day of the First Month
was a Memorable and Blessed Day amongst
the Children of <hi>Israel:</hi> See <hi>Exod. 12. 18,
40, 41, 42, 51. Levit. 23. 5. Numb. 28. 16.</hi>
Four hundred and thirty Years being expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

of their dwelling in <hi>Egypt,</hi> even in the
<hi>Self-same Day</hi> departed they thence.</p>
               <p>A thing something parallel to this, we read
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Histories: That that very
day four Years, that the Civil Wars were
begun by <hi>Pompey</hi> the Father, <hi>Caesar</hi> made
an end of them with his Sons; <hi>Cnaeus Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi>
being then slain, and it being also the
last Battle <hi>Caesar</hi> was ever in. <hi>[Heylyn</hi> in the
Kingdom of <hi>Corduba.]</hi> The Calendar to
<hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Fastorum</hi> says, <hi>Aprilis erat menfis

Month among the <hi>Grecians.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> counted <hi>Febr. 13.</hi> an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
day, and therefore then never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
any Business of Importance; for
on that day they were overthrown at <hi>Allia</hi>
by the <hi>Gauls;</hi> and the <hi>Fabii</hi> attacquing the
City of the <hi>Veii,</hi> were all slain save one.

And see the Calendar annext to <hi>Ovid</hi>'s
<hi>Fastorum,</hi> as to the last Circumstance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> accounted <hi>August 10.</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
day; for on that Day the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was destroyed by <hi>Titus</hi> the Son of <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian;</hi>
on which day also the first Temple
was consumed with Fire by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.
[Heylyn.]</hi> The <hi>Treasury of the Times</hi> says, the
Eighth of <hi>Loyon (August)</hi> the very same day
679 Years one after another.</p>
               <p>And not only among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
<hi>Iews,</hi> but also among Christians, a like
Custom of observing such days is used, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially-<hi>Childermas</hi>
or <hi>Innocents-day. Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
tells us, that <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. used not to
debate any Matter, but accounted it a sign
of great Misfortune towards him, if any
Man communed with him of his Affairs;
and would be very angry with those about
him, if they troubled him with any Matter
whatsoever upon that day.</p>
               <p>But I will descend to more particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances

               <p>Upon the Sixth of <hi>April, Alexander the
Great</hi> was born. Upon the same day he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
<hi>Darius,</hi> won a great Victory at Sea,
and died the same day.</p>
               <p>Neither was this day less fortunate to his
Father <hi>Philip;</hi> for on the same day he took
<hi>Potidea; Parmenio</hi> his General gave a great
Overthrow to the <hi>Illyrians;</hi> and his Horse
was Victor at the <hi>Olympick Games.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54241:6"/>
his Prophets foretold to him, <hi>Filium

was accompanied with three Victories,

               <p>Upon the Thirtieth of <hi>September, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey
the Great</hi> was born: Upon that day he
Triumphed for his <hi>Asian</hi> Conquest; and on
that day he died.</p>
               <p>The Nineteenth of <hi>August</hi> was the day of
<hi>Augustus</hi> his Adoption: On the same day
he began his Consulship: He Conquered

died. Hitherto out of the <hi>Memoirs of King</hi>

Third of <hi>November,</hi> both because 'tis my

observed some remarkable Accidents to

               <p>
                  <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour, Son of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine
the Great,</hi> little inseriour to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

died the Third of <hi>November: Ex veteri Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendario
penes me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Montacute</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> that
great Man, and Famous Commander under
<hi>Henry</hi> IV. V. and VI. died this day, by a
Wound of a Cannon-shot he received at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance,
E MSS. quodam, &amp; Glovero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So also Cardinal <hi>Borrhomeo,</hi> famous for
his Sanctity of Life, and therefore Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54241:9"/>
(<hi>Heylyn</hi> in his <hi>Praecognita,</hi> says, <hi>He
made Milan</hi> memorable, by his Residence
there) died 1584. this day, as <hi>Possevinus</hi> in
his Life.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Perot (Stow</hi> corruptly calls him
<hi>Parrat)</hi> a Man very remarkable in his
Time, Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Son to
<hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and extreamly like him, died
in the <hi>Tower,</hi> the Third of <hi>November 1592.</hi>
(as <hi>Stow</hi> says) Grief, and the Fatality of
this Day killed him. See <hi>Nanton</hi>'s <hi>Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta
Regalia,</hi> concerning this Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stow</hi> in his <hi>Annals,</hi> says, <hi>Anno 1099,
November 3.</hi> as well in <hi>Scotland</hi> as <hi>England,</hi>
the Sea broke in over the Banks of many
Rivers, drowning divers Towns, and much
People, with an innumerable number of
Oxen and Sheep, at which time the Lands
in <hi>Kent,</hi> sometimes belonging to Earl <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>
were covered with Sands, and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and to this day are called <hi>Godwins</hi>
Sands.</p>
               <p>I had an Estate left me in <hi>Kent,</hi> of
which between thirty and forty Acres was
Marsh-land, very conveniently flanking its
Up-land; and in those days this Marsh-land
was usually let for Four Nobles an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre.
My Father died 1643. Within a
Year and half after his decase, such Charges
and Water-scots came upon this Marsh-land,
by the influence of the Sea, that it
was never worth one Farthing to me, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54241:9"/>
very often eat into the Rents of the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
So that I often think, this day being
my Birth-day, hath the same evil influence
upon me, that it had 580 years since upon
Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> and others concerned in Low
Lands.</p>
               <p>The Parliament so fatal to <hi>Rome</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
here, in <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. time, began the
Third of <hi>November</hi> (26 of his Reign); in
which the <hi>Pope,</hi> with all his Authority,
was clean banished the Realm; he no more
to be called otherwise than Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi>
the King to be taken and reputed as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
having full Authority to reform all Errors,
Heresies and Abuses of the same: Also the
First-fruits and Tenths of all Spiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
and Dignities were granted to the
King. See <hi>Stow</hi>'s <hi>Annals,</hi> and <hi>Weaver,</hi>
page 80.</p>
               <p>Not long after which followed the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Abbies, Priories, and Nunneries;
and after that, their final Suppression: This
Parliament being the Door or Entrance
thereto.</p>
               <p>The Third of <hi>November 1640,</hi> began that
Parliament so direfully fatal to <hi>England,</hi> in
its Peace, its Wealth, its Religion, its Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Nobility, nay, its Kings. So verifying
the former Verse of the <hi>Calendar.</hi>

                  <l>Scorpius est quintus, &amp; tertius è nece cinctus.</l>

The Third of <hi>September</hi> was a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
day to the English <hi>Attila, Oliver. 1650,</hi>
He obtained a memorable Victory at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar;</hi>
another at <hi>Worcester, 1651.</hi> And that
day he died, 1658.</p>
               <p>The first two Occurrences wonderfully
accord to the preceeding Verses.
<q>Tertia Septembris, &amp; denus fert mala
membris.</q>
Being fatal to the two Members of <hi>Great
Britain, Scotland</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> The third,
as happy to them both, as the same day,
1666, was dismal and unhappy to the City
of <hi>London,</hi> and consequently to the whole
Kingdom, with its immediate preceeding
and two succeeding days, <hi>viz.</hi> the Second,
Fourth, and Fifth of <hi>September.</hi>

                  <hi>Tuesday (Dies Martis)</hi> was a most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable

Thomas, My Church shall be glorified in thy

1220,</hi> his Venerable Body received the
Glory and Renown of Translation, Fifty
Years after his Passion. Thus my Author.</p>

See <hi>The just weight of the Scarlet

               <p>Turning over our Annals, I chanced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a two-fold Circumstance: I will not
say, that none else hath observed the same;
but I protest, (<hi>It a me Deus amet, ut verum
loquor</hi>) I do not know of any that have; and
therefore must justly claim to be acquitted
from the least suspicion of Plagiarism, or
plowing with others Heifers.</p>
               <p>The First is, of <hi>William the Conquerour.</hi>
The Second, of <hi>Edward</hi> III. (I need not say
any thing of the Eminency of these two;
every one knows what great things they
did.) And making reflection upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious
Birth-day of his Royal Highness
the Duke of <hi>YORK,</hi> I adventured upon
the following Composure. [I cannot be
proud of my Poetry; but I cannot but be
glad of my <hi>BON HEVR, d'avoir (en

                              <p>These Verses I presented in <hi>Anno 1672,</hi>

Since which time, Old <hi>Fabian</hi> coming
into my hands, from him I got knowledg,
that that advantageous Peace, mentioned by
<hi>Stow, Anno 1360,</hi> (concluded between
the forementioned King <hi>Edward</hi> III. and the
<hi>French</hi> King) was acted upon the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>October,</hi> with grand Solemnity.</p>
                              <p>The two former Circumstances must
needs fall out Providentially: Whether this
last of <hi>Anno 1360,</hi> was designed by <hi>Edward</hi>
III. or no, (as remembring his former good
hap) may be some question: I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not.</p>
                              <p>Where things are under a Mans peculiar
Concern, he may fix a time; but here was
the <hi>French</hi> King concerned equally with
the <hi>English,</hi> and many other great Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
interested. To have tied them up to his
own Auspicious. Conceit of the Day, had
been an unkind Oppression, and would
have brought the Judgment of so Wise a
Prince into question: We may conclude
then, 'twas meerly fortuitous. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the former Observation concerning
this Famous <hi>Edward,</hi> give me leave to add,

Pell,</hi> D. D. from whom I had it.</p>
                  <p>They that called the City of <hi>Rome, Vrbs
Aeterna,</hi> seemed to believe, that <hi>Rome</hi> could
never be destroyed. But there have been
great numbers of Men, that did verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that it shall have an irrecoverable
overthrow. Writers have proceeded so far,
as to foretel the time of <hi>Rome</hi>'s final Ruine.
Some said that <hi>Rome</hi>'s Perdition should
happen in the Year of Christ 1670. They
have now been decryed Nine whole Years:
So that few take care to know what Reasons
moved them to pitch upon that Number.</p>

                     <hi>A</hi> Lutheran <hi>Historian,</hi> Anno 1656 <hi>wrote
thus:</hi> Finem Iubileorum Ecclesiasticorum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niumque
temporum in Scriptura revelatorum,
desinere in Annum Christi Millesimum sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centesimum
&amp; septuagesimum, antehac obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vavit
Beatus Gerhardus cum Philippo Nicolao.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54241:15"/>
But all Men are not of Dr. <hi>Gerhard</hi>'s Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Many Men believe, that some of the
Prophesies in the Revelation do reach far
beyond our times, and that the events
of future times will unclasp and unseal a
considerable portion of the Apocalypse.</p>
                  <p>One of the Reasons that recommended
the Number of 1670, was because it is the
Sum of 410, and 1260.</p>
                  <p>Historians agree, that in the Year of
Christ 410, in the Month of <hi>August Rome</hi>
was trampled under foot, and her Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Inhabitants were miserably slaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Victorious Army of <hi>Alaric,</hi> a
Christian King of the <hi>Goths. Paulus Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conus</hi>
saith, <hi>August</hi> the 24th was the day of
King <hi>Alaric</hi>'s taking <hi>Rome. Kedrenus</hi> saith,
it was <hi>August</hi> the 26th, perhaps the Army
first entred the 24th, and the King follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not till two days after.</p>
                  <p>As for the other Number 1260. It is
twice found in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
Chap. 11. 3. <hi>My two witnesses shall Prophesie
a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</hi> And
chap. 12. 6. <hi>Should feed the Woman in the
Wilderness a thousand two hundred and three-score
days.</hi> And it is there expressed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
form <hi>[42 times 30]</hi> chap. 11. 2. <hi>The
Gentiles shall tread the holy City under foot
forty and two Months.</hi> chap. 13. 5. <hi>Power
was given to the Blasphemous Beast to continue
forty and two months.</hi> chap. 12. 14. <hi>The

                     </gap> hath 360 days, or twelve Months at
thirty days to a Month. No doubt <hi>Daniel</hi> had
given occasion to this expression, chap. 7. 25.
<hi>A time, and times, and the dividing of time.</hi>
No Man can ground any distinct reasoning
upon such general words. But at the end of
the Chapter, he left off his <hi>Chaldean</hi> Tongue,
and wrote <hi>Hebrew</hi> in the rest of his Book; and
chap. 12. 7. he speaks more distinctly <hi>[For

(<gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Hebrew</hi> words which we Translate Time.
But yet it is not tyed to a just number of
days (as 360) but is capable of various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
in several Prophesies. <hi>Daniel</hi>
useth a Plural in both places, and not a Dual
<hi>[Two times, and two seasons]</hi> Nor doth <hi>Iohn</hi>
say, <hi>Two seasons:</hi> But by his <hi>Numeral Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration,</hi>
he teacheth us to understand him,
as if he had said (chap. 12. 14.) <hi>For three
seasons and half a season:</hi> I say <hi>Numeral
Illustration.</hi> For I take it to be no other
than an easie example (12 and 24 and 6

                  <p>By 1260 days almost all the Interpreters
understand so many Years, but not a Year
of 360 days; because they find no Nation
that hath so short a Year. The <hi>Egyptians</hi>

But <hi>Iulian</hi> Years 1378 3/8 are 1278 <hi>Iulian</hi>

                  <p>Almost 100 years ago, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the

wherein the Years length is supposed to

<hi>Gregorian</hi> Years 1278279/800 are 1278 <hi>Iulian</hi>

                  <hi>Sturton</hi> [the Seat of the Lord <hi>Sturton</hi>]
was belonging to this Family before the
Conquest. They say, that after the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
at <hi>Battaile, William</hi> the Conquerour
came in Person into the West, to receive
their Rendition; that the Lord Abbot of

               <p>The Honourable Family of the <hi>Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi>
is probably of as great Antiquity as
any in the County of <hi>Wilts. Hungerford</hi>

by Sir <hi>Edward Hungerford</hi> Knight of the
Bath; as also the Noble and Ancient Seat
of <hi>Farleigh-Castle,</hi> about <hi>An. 167</hi> ... But that
<hi>this</hi> Estate should so long continue is not
very strange; for it being so vast, 'twas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make several with-standings against

               <p>The Family of <hi>Gawen</hi> have been long at

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr>
to Sir <hi>Wadham Windham</hi> one of the Judges
of the Kings Bench about 1665. They
continued in this place Four hundred fifty
and odd Years. Then also was sold their
Estate in <hi>Broad-Chalk,</hi> which they had as
long, or perhaps longer. On the South
Down of the Farm of <hi>Broad-Chalk</hi> is a little
Barrow called <hi>Gawen</hi>'s Barrow; [which
must be before Ecclesiastical Canons were
constituted; for since, Burials are only in
Consecrated ground.] King <hi>Edgar</hi> gave

drop of Blood, or Blood-like upon it; which
left a stain not to be wiped off. This Bust
was carved from a Picture of Sir <hi>Anthony
Van Dyke</hi>'s Drawing; the Sculptor found
great fault with the Fore-head, as most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.
There was a Seam in the middle
of his Fore-head (downwards) which is a
very ill sign in Metoposcopie.</p>
               <p>Colonel <hi>Sharington Talbot</hi> was at <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>

               <p>The day that the Long Parliament began

King <hi>Charles</hi> in Wood in Sir—<hi>Trenchard</hi>'s

which when Bishop <hi>Duppe</hi> read, the King
was displeased with him, thinking he had
done it of choice: but the Bishop cleared
himself by the Kalendar, as is to be seen.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> II. was Crowned at the very
conjunction of the Sun and <hi>Mercury; Mercury</hi>
being then in <hi>Corde Solis.</hi> As the King was

the Thunder played together.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> II. went by long Sea to
<hi>Portsmouth,</hi> or <hi>Plymouth,</hi> or both: an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Storm arose, which carried
him almost to <hi>France.</hi> Sir <hi>Ionas Moor</hi> (who
was then with his Majesty) gave me this
Account, and said, that when they came
to <hi>Portsmouth</hi> to refresh themselves, they had
not been there above half an Hour, but the
Weather was Calm and the Sun shone:
His Majesty put to Sea again, and in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

               <p>When King <hi>Iames</hi> II. was Crowned [ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Ancient Custom, the Peers
go to the Throne, and kiss the King] the
Crown was almost kiss'd off his Head. An
Earl did set it right: And as he came from
the Abbey to <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> the Crown
totter'd extreamly.</p>
               <p>The Canopy [of Cloath of Gold] carried
over King <hi>Iames</hi> IIs. Head by the Wardens
of the Cinque Ports, was torn by a puff of
Wind as he came to <hi>Westminster-hall:</hi> It
hung down very lamentably: I saw it.</p>
               <p>The top of his Scepter <hi>[Flower de Lis]</hi> did
then fall, which the Earl of <hi>Peterborough</hi> took
up.</p>

Upon Saint <hi>Mark</hi>'s day, after the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of King <hi>Iames</hi> II. were prepared
stately Fire-works on the <hi>Thames:</hi> It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
that they took fire all together, and
it was so dreadful, that several Spectators
leap'd into the River, choosing rather to be
drown'd than burn'd. In a Yard by the
<hi>Thames</hi> was my Lord <hi>Powys</hi>'s Coach and
Horses: the Horses were so frighted by the
Fire-works, that the Coachman was not
able to stop them, but ran away over one
who with great difficulty recovered.</p>
               <p>When King <hi>Iames</hi> II. was at <hi>Salisbury,
Anno</hi> 1688, the Iron Crown upon the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret
of the Councel-house was blown off.</p>
               <p>In <hi>February, March,</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> two Ravens
built their Nests on the Weather-cock of the
high Steeple at <hi>Bakwell</hi> in <hi>Darbyshire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I did see Mr. <hi>Chr. Love</hi> beheaded on
<hi>Tower-hill,</hi> in a delicate clear day: About
half an hour after his Head was struck off,
the Clouds gathered blacker and blacker:
and such terrible Claps of Thunder came,
that I never heard greater.</p>
               <p>'Tis reported, that the like happened af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Execution of Alderman <hi>Cornish</hi> in
<hi>Cheap-side, Octob.</hi> 23. 1685.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1643, as Major <hi>Iohn Morgan</hi> of
<hi>Wells</hi> was marching with the Kings Army
into the West, fell sick of a Malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and was brought dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
ill to my Father's at <hi>Broad-Chalk,</hi> where
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54241:25"/>
he was lodged, secretly, in a Garret. There
came a <hi>Sparrow</hi> to the Chamber Window,
which peck'd the Lead of a certain Pannel
only, and only one side of the Lead of the
Lozenge, and made one small hole in it.
He continued this pecking and biting the
Lead, during the whole time of his sickness
(which was not less than a Month) when
the Major went away the Sparrow desisted:
and came thither no more. Two of the
Servants that attended the Major, and sober
Persons, declared this for a certainty.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Walter Long</hi>'s [of <hi>Dorset</hi> in <hi>Wilts</hi>]
Widow did make a solemn promise to him,
on his Death-bed, that she would not marry
after his Decease. But not long after one
Sir—<hi>Fox,</hi> a very Beautiful young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
did win her Love: so that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
her Promise aforesaid, she married
him: She married at <hi>South-wrax-hall,</hi> where
the Picture of Sir <hi>Walter</hi> hung over the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
door, as it doth now at <hi>Dracot.</hi> As
Sir—<hi>Fox</hi> led his Bride by the hand
from the Church (which is near to the
House) into the Parlour, the string of the
Picture brake, and the Picture fell on her
shoulder, and crack'd in the fall: [it was
painted on wood as the fashion was in those
days.] This made her Ladyship reflect on
her Promise, and drew some Tears from her

See Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s History Book IV.
chap. 2. §. 7. p ... The Dogs of the <hi>French</hi>
Army, the night before the Battle of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vara,</hi>
ran all to the <hi>Swisses</hi> Army: the next
day the <hi>Swisses</hi> obtained a glorious Victory
of the <hi>French.</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> affirms it
to be certainly true.</p>
               <p>The last Battle fought in the North of
<hi>Ireland</hi> between the Protestants and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
was in <hi>Glinsuly</hi> near <hi>Letterkenny</hi> in the
County of <hi>Donegall. Veneras</hi> was the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Bishop of <hi>Clogher,</hi> and that of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Army Sir <hi>Charles Coot.</hi> They
pitch'd their Tents on each side the River
<hi>Suly.</hi> And the Papists constantly persist in
it to this very day, that the Night before
the Action, a Woman of uncommon
stature all in white appearing to the said
Bishop, admonished him not to cross the
River first to assault the Enemy, but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to do it, whereby he should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Victory. That if the <hi>Irish</hi> took
the water first to move towards the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
they should be put to a total rout,
which came to pass. <hi>Ocahan,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry
O Neal</hi> who were both kill'd there, saw se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
the same Apparition, and disswaded
the Bishop from giving the first onset, but
could not prevail upon him. In the mean
time I find nothing in this Revelation, that
any common Soldier might not conclude
without extraordinary means.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:54241:26"/>
Near the same place a party of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
had been surpriz'd sleeping by the
Popish <hi>Irish,</hi> were it not for several Wrens
that just wakned them by dancing and
pecking on the Drums as the Enemy were
approaching. For this reason the wild
<hi>Irish</hi> mortally hate these Birds to this day,
calling them the Devils Servants, and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them where ever they catch them;
They teach their Children to thrust them
full of Thorns: You'll see sometimes on Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidays
a whole Parish running like mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
from Hedg to Hedg a Wren-hunting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1679, After the Discovery of the
Popish Plot, the Penal Laws were put in
execution against the <hi>Roman Catholicks:</hi> So,
that if they did not receive the Sacrament
according to the Church of <hi>England</hi> in their
Parish Church, they were to be severely
proceeded against according to Law: Mr.
<hi>Ployden,</hi> to avoid the Penalty, went to his
Parish Church at <hi>Lasham</hi> near <hi>Alton</hi> in
<hi>Hampshire:</hi> when Mr. <hi>Laurence</hi> [the
Minister] had put the Chalice into Mr.
<hi>Ployden</hi>'s hand, the Cup of it (wherein the
Wine was) fell off. 'Tis true, It was out
of order before; and he had a Tremor in
his hand. The Communion was stopt by
this accident. This was attested to me by
two of the Neighbouring Ministers, as also
several Gentlemen of the Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:54241:26"/>
When King <hi>Iames</hi> II. first entred <hi>Dublin</hi>
after his Arrival from <hi>France</hi> 1689, one of
the Gentlemen that bore the Mace before
him stumbled without any rub in his way,
or other visible occasion. The Mace fell
out of his hands, and the little Cross upon
the Crown thereof stuck fast between two
stones in the street. This is very well
known all over <hi>Ireland,</hi> and did much
trouble King <hi>Iames</hi> himself with many of
his chief Attendants.</p>

               <p>The Plague raging in the Army of the
Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> Vth, he Dreamt, that the
Decoction of the Root of the <hi>Dwarfe-Thistle</hi>

<hi>Gerards</hi> Herbal, who tells us this.</p>
               <p>In Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, there was only
one Congregation of <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>London,</hi>
to the number of about 300. One—
was the Deacon to them, and kept the List
of their Names: One—of that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54241:29"/>
did Dream, that a Messenger [Queens
Officer] had seized on this Deacon, and
taken his List; the Fright of the Dream a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked
him: He fell asleep and dreamt the
same perfect Dream again. In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before he went out of his Chamber, the
Deacon came to him and told him his
Dream, and said, it was a Warning from
God; the Deacon slighted his advice as
savouring of Superstition; but—was so
urgent with him, that he prevail'd with him
to deposite the List in some other Hand,
which he did that Day. The next Day the
Queens Officer attacqued him, and search'd
(in vain) for the List, which had it been
found, would have brought them all to the
Flame. <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Martyrology.</hi>

               <p>When Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot</hi>'s Mother (a
poor Clothworker's Wife in <hi>Gilford</hi>) was
with Child of him, she did <hi>long</hi> for a <hi>Iack,</hi>
and she dreamt that if she should Eat a
Jack, her Son in her Belly should be a <hi>great
Man.</hi> She arose early the next Morning
and went with her Pail to the River-side
(which runneth by the House, now an Ale-house,
the Sign of the 3 <hi>Mariners</hi>) to take
up some Water, and in the Water in the
Pail she found a good Jack, which she
dressed, and eat it all, or very near. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the best Inhabitants of <hi>Gilford</hi> were
invited (or invited themselves) to the
Christning of the Child; it was Bred up a

who had never been at <hi>London,</hi> did Dream,
that he was there, and as he was walking
in a great Street there, espied in a Goldsmiths
Glass-Desk, an Antique Coin, he could
never meet with (I think an <hi>Otho.</hi>) When
he came to <hi>London,</hi> walking in (I think)
<hi>Cheapside</hi> he saw such a Shop, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred

went to <hi>Dover</hi> (with several others) and
shewed his Pass, as the rest did, to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
there. The Governor told him,
that he must not go, but he must keep him
Prisoner. The Doctor desired to know for
what reason? how he had transgrest. Well it
was his Will to have it so. The Pacquet-Boat
Hoised Sail in the Evening (which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
clear) and the Doctor's Companions in
it. There ensued a terrible Storm, and the
Pacquet-Boat and all the Passengers were
Drown'd: The next day the sad News
was brought to <hi>Dover.</hi> The Doctor was
unknown to the Governor, but by Name
and Face; but the Night before, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor

had a perfect Vision in a Dream of
Doctor <hi>Harvey,</hi> who came to pass over
to <hi>Calais;</hi> and that he had a Warning to
stop him. This the Governor told to the
Doctor the next day. The Doctor was a

others pursuing; and among those that
fled, he saw a Kinsman of his who went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Scotland</hi> to the King's Army. They
heard in the Country, that the King was

When Sir <hi>Christopher Wren</hi> was at <hi>Paris</hi>
about 1671, he was Ill and Feverish, made

to be let Blood, thinking he had a <hi>Pleurisy:</hi>
But Bleeding much disagreeing with his
Constitution, he would defer it a Day lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:

did so: she found ease in a quarter of an

               <p>Captain—<hi>Wingate</hi> told me, that Mr.
<hi>Edmund Gunter</hi> of <hi>Gresham</hi> College did cast
his Nativity, when he was about 17, or 18
Years old; by which he did Prognosticate
that he should be in danger to lose his Life
for Treason. Several Years before the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Wars broke out, he had dreamt that he
was to be put to Death, before a great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
which he had never seen; which made
a strong impression in his Memory. In
<hi>Anno 1642,</hi> he did oppose the Church Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
and was chosen a Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
then was made a Captain, and
was taken Prisoner at <hi>Edge-hill</hi> by Prince
<hi>Rupert,</hi> and carried to <hi>Kenelworth</hi> Castle,
where he was Tryed by a Council of
War, and Condemn'd to Die: But they
did better consider of it, and spared his
Life; for that he being so considerable
a Person, might make an exchange for some
of the King's Party: And he was exchang'd
for the Right Honourable <hi>Montague</hi> Earl of
<hi>Lindsey</hi> (Heir of the General). Since the
Restauration he was made one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of the Excise-Office in <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>Sir <hi>Roger L'Estrange</hi> was wont to diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise

that there came to him in such a place of the
Park a Servant, who brought him News,
that his Father (who had been Sick a good
while) was departed. The next day go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his usual Recreation, he was resolv'd
for his Dream sake to avoid that way; but
his Game led him to it, and in that very
place, the Servant came and brought him
the Ill News according to his Dream.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Edmund Halley</hi> R. S. S. was carried on
with a strong Impulse to take a Voyage to
St. <hi>Hellens,</hi> to make Observations of the
<hi>Southern Constellations,</hi> being then about 24
Years Old. Before he undertook his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
he dream'd that he was at Sea Sailing
towards that place, and saw the Prospect
of it from the Ship in his Dream, which
he declared in the R. Society that it was the
perfect Representation of that Island, even
as he had it really when he approach'd to
it.</p>
               <p>A Gentlewoman dream'd that a Pul<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ess
of <hi>Blew-Corans,</hi> would Cure her sore
Throat; and it did so: She was a pious
Woman, and affirm'd it to be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 1690</hi> one in <hi>Ireland</hi> dream'd of a
Brother, or near Relation of his, (who
lived at <hi>Amesbery</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire</hi>) that he saw
him riding on the Downs, and that two
Thieves Robb'd him and Murther'd him:
The Dream awaked him, he fell asleep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and had the like Dream. He Writ to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54241:32"/>
his Relation an account of it, and describ'd
the Thieves Complexion, Stature and
Cloths; and advis'd him to take care of
himself. Not long after he had receiv'd
this Monitory Letter, he Rode towards
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> and was Robb'd and Murther'd:
And the Murtherers were discovered by
this Letter, and were Executed: They
hang in Chains on the Road to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twas reveal'd to a King of <hi>Scots,</hi> that if
he drank of the Water of <hi>Muswell,</hi> he should
be Cured—After great enquiry, they
heard of such a place, not far from <hi>Hornsey</hi>
in <hi>Middlesex.</hi> See <hi>Weaver</hi>'s <hi>Funeral Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>

founded a Religious-House for <hi>Austin</hi>
Monks: Since it belonged to Sir <hi>Tho. Row:</hi>
and in 1677, was pull'd down, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
sold. Anciently the King's of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were Feudatory to the King's of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and did their Homage every <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>

               <p>Mrs. <hi>Cl.</hi> of <hi>S.</hi> in the County of <hi>S.</hi> had a
beloved Daughter, who had been a long
time Ill, and received no benefit from her
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54241:32"/>
Physitians. She dream'd that a Friend of
hers deceased, told her, that if she gave her
Daughter a Drench of Yewgh pounded, that
she would recover, she gave her the Drench
and it Killed her. Whereupon she grew
almost distracted: Her Chamber Maid to
Complement her, and mitigate her Grief,
said surely that could not Kill her; she
would adventure to take the same her self;
she did so, and died also. This was about
the Year 1670, or 1671. I knew the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>A Gentlewoman of my acquaintance
dream'd, that if she slept again, the House
would be in danger to be Robb'd: She kept
awake, and anon Thieves came to break
open the House; but were prevented.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Winstanly</hi> (Surveyor of the King's
Works) hath built a handsome House at
<hi>Littlebury</hi> in <hi>Cambridgshire</hi> near <hi>Audely</hi>-Inn
where are to be seen several Ingenious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines;
one whereof is thus: A Wooden
Slipper finely Carved lieth on the Floor of a
Chamber about a Yard and an half within
the Door, which the Stranger is to take up
(it comes up pretty stiff) and up starts a
Skeleton. <hi>I. H.</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> had been there: And
being at <hi>West-Lavington</hi> with the Earl of
<hi>Abbington,</hi> dream'd <hi>December</hi> the 9th, that he
was at Mr. <hi>Winstanly</hi>'s House, and took up
the Slipper, and up rose his Mother in
Mourning: And anon the Queen appeared
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54241:33"/>
in Mourning. He told his Dream the next
Morning to my Lord, and his Lordship im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
it to me (then there). <hi>Tuesday Dec. 11.</hi>
in the Evening, came a Messenger Post from
<hi>London</hi> to acquaint Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that his Mother
was dangerously Ill: He went to <hi>London</hi>
the next Day: his Mother lived but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
8 Days longer. On <hi>Saturday Dec. 15.</hi>
the Queen was taken Ill, which turned to
the Small-Pox, of which she died <hi>Decem. 28</hi>
about two a Clock in the Morning.</p>
               <p>There are Millions of such Dreams too
little taken notice of; but they have the truest
Dreams, whose IX<hi rend="sup">th</hi> House is well dignified;
which mine is not: But most have some
Monitory Dreams. The <hi>Germans</hi> are great
Observers of them. It is said, in the Life
of <hi>Vavasor Powell,</hi> that he was a great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
of Dreams, (<hi>P.</hi> 17 and 114 of his
Life) that he had many Warnings from
them; that God had spoken to himself and
others by them; for Warning, Instruction,
or Reproof: And it is also there averred,
that Angels had appear'd to him. See <hi>P.</hi> 8.
of his Life.</p>
               <p>In Mr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s Life of Sir <hi>Hen. Wotton,</hi>

[or <hi>Entendez vous?</hi>] he could not tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>There is a Tradition (which I have
heard from Persons of Honour) that as the
Protector <hi>Seymor</hi> and his Duchess were
walking in the Gallery at <hi>Sheen</hi> [in <hi>Surrey</hi>]
both of them did see a Hand with a bloody
Sword come out of the Wall. He was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
beheaded.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Caisho Burroughs</hi> was one of the most
beautiful Men in <hi>England,</hi> and very Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
but very proud and blood-thirsty:
There was then in <hi>London</hi> a very Beautiful
<hi>Italian</hi> Lady, who fell so extreamly in Love
with him, that she did let him enjoy her,
which she had never let any Man do before:
Wherefore, said she, I shall request this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of you, never to tell any one of it.
The Gentlewoman died: and afterwards
in a Tavern in <hi>London</hi> he spake of it: and
there going to make water, the Ghost of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54241:34"/>
the Gentlewoman did appear to him. He
was afterwards troubled with the Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her, even sometimes in company
when he was drinking; but he only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved
it: Before she did appear he did
find a kind of Chilness upon his Spirits; she
did appear to him in the Morning before
he was killed in a Duel. This account I have
from an intimate Friend of mine, who was
an acquaintance of his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 1647,</hi> the Lord <hi>Mohun</hi>'s Son and
Heir (a gallant Gentleman, Valiant, and a
great Master of Fencing and Horsemanship)
had a Quarrel with Prince <hi>Griffin;</hi> there
was a Challenge, and they were to Fight
on Horse-back in <hi>Chelsey-fields</hi> in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Mr. <hi>Mohun</hi> went accordingly to meet
him; but about <hi>Ebery-Farm</hi> he was met
by some who quarrell'd with him and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol'd
him; it was believed, by the Order
of Prince <hi>Griffin;</hi> for he was sure, that Mr.
<hi>Mohun</hi> being so much the better Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> would have Killed him, had they
Fought. In <hi>Iames-street</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi>
did then Lodge a Gentlewoman a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Woman but Common, who was Mr.
<hi>Mohun</hi>'s Sweet-heart. Mr. <hi>Mohun</hi> was
Murthered about Ten a clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and at that very time, his Mistress
being in Bed, saw Mr. <hi>Mohun</hi> come to her
Bed-side, drew the Curtain, looked upon
her and went away: She called after him
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54241:35"/>
but no answer: She knock'd for her Maid,
ask'd her for Mr. <hi>Mohun;</hi> she said, she did
not see him, and had the Key of her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
door in her Pocket. This Account my
Friend aforesaid, had from the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
own Mouth, and her Maids.</p>
               <p>A parallel Story to this, is, that Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi>
(Brother-in-law to the Lord <hi>Conningsby</hi>) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
his being Murthered to several.
His Phantome appear'd to his Sister and her
Maid in <hi>Fleet-street</hi> about the time he was
Killed in <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> which was about a
Year since, 1693.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Walter Long</hi> of <hi>Draycot</hi> (Grandfather
of Sir <hi>Iames Long</hi>) had two Wives; the
first a Daughter of Sir—<hi>Packinton</hi> in
<hi>Worcestershire;</hi> by whom he had a Son:
His second Wife was a Daugter of Sir <hi>Iohn
Thinne</hi> of <hi>Longleat;</hi> by whom he had seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sons and Daughters. The second Wife
did use much Artifice to render the Son by
the first Wife (who had not much Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thean
Fire) Odious to his Father; she
would get her Acquaintance to make him
Drunk; and then expose him in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to his Father; in fine she never left off
her attempts, till she had got Sir <hi>Walter</hi> to
disinherit him. She laid the Scene for the
doing this, at <hi>Bath</hi> at the Assizes, where
was her Brother Sir <hi>Egrimond Thinne</hi> an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Serjeant at Law, who drew the
Writing; and his Clerk was to sit up all
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54241:35"/>
Night to Engross it; as he was Writing, he
perceived a shadow on the Parchment, from
the Candle; he look'd up, and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
a Hand, which immediately va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd;
he was startled at it, but thought it
might be only his Fancy, being sleepy; so
he Writ on; by and by a fine White-hand
interposed between the Writing and the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
(he could discern it was a Womans
Hand) but vanish'd as before; I have forgot
it appeared a Third time. But with that,
the Clerk threw down his Pen, and would
Engross no more, but goes and tells his
Master of it, and absolutely refused to do it.
But it was done by some body, and Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Long</hi> was prevailed with to Seal and
Sign it. He lived not long after; and his
Body did not go quiet to the Grave, it being
Arrested at the Church-porch by the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees
of the first Lady. The Heir's Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
took his part, and Commenc'd a Suit
against Sir <hi>Walter</hi> (the second Son) and
compell'd him to accept of a Moiety of the
Estate; so the Eldest Son kept <hi>South-Wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Walter</hi> the second Son <hi>Dracot
Cernes, &amp;c.</hi> This was about the middle of
the Reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> the First.</p>
               <p>I must not forget an Apparition in my
Country, which appear'd several times to
Doctor <hi>Turbervile</hi>'s Sister, at <hi>Salisbury;</hi>
which is much talk'd of. One Marry'd a
second Wife, and contrary to the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54241:36"/>
and Settlement at the first Wife's
Marriage, did wrong the Children by the
first Venter. The Settlement was hid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
a Wainscot in the Chamber where the
Doctor's Sister did lie: And the Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the first Wife did discover it to her.
By which means Right was done to the
first Wife's Children. The Apparition told
her that she Wandred in the Air, and was
now going to God. Dr. <hi>Turbervile</hi> (Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list)
did affirm this to be true. See Mr.
<hi>Glanvill's Sadducismus Triumphatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Mr. <hi>Towes</hi> who had been School-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
with Sir <hi>George Villers,</hi> the Father of
the first Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> (and was his
Friend and Neighbour) as he lay in his Bed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
(and it was Day-light,) came into his
Chamber the Phantome of his dear Friend
Sir <hi>George Villers:</hi> Said Mr. <hi>Towes</hi> to him,
Why, you are Dead, what make you here?
Said the Knight, I am Dead, but cannot
rest in peace for the Wickedness and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of my Son <hi>George</hi> at Court. I do
appear to you, to tell him of it, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
and dehort him from his Evil ways.
Said Mr. <hi>Tows,</hi> the Duke will not believe
me, but will say, that I am Mad, or Doat.
Said Sir <hi>George,</hi> Go to him from me, and
tell him by such a Token [some Mole] that
he had in some secret place, which none but
himself knew of. Accordingly Mr. <hi>Towes</hi>
went to the Duke, who Laugh'd at his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54241:36"/>
At his return home, the Phantome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
again; and told him, that the Duke
would be Stab'd (he drew out a Dagger) a
quarter of a Year after: And you shall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
him half a Year; and the Warning that
you shall have of your Death will be, That
your Nose will fall a bleeding: All which
accordingly fell out so. This Account I have
had (in the main) from two, or three;
but Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi> affirms what I have
here taken from him to be true, and that
the Apparition told him of several things to
come, which proved true, <hi>e. g.</hi> of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that should be honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
delivered. This Mr. <hi>Towes</hi> had so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the Ghost of his old Friend appear to
him, that it was not at all terrible to him.
He was Surveyor of the Works at <hi>Windsor</hi>
(by the favour of the Duke:) Being then
sitting in the Hall, he cried out, The Duke
of <hi>Buckingham</hi> is stabb'd: He was stabb'd
that very moment.</p>
               <p>This Relation Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi> had
from Mr. <hi>Pine,</hi> (Neighbour to Mr. <hi>Towes</hi>
without <hi>Bishop-gate</hi>) they were both great
lovers of Musick, and sworn Brothers. Mr.
<hi>William Lilly</hi> Astrologer, did Print this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
false, which made Sir <hi>Edmund Wyndam</hi>
(who Married Mr. <hi>Pines</hi> Daughter) give to
Sir <hi>George Hollis</hi> this true Account contrary
to Mr. <hi>Lilly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:54241:37"/>
Mr. <hi>Thomas Elyot,</hi> Groom of the Bed-Chamber,
Married Sir <hi>Edmund Wyndham</hi>'s
Daughter, and had the Roll (of near a
Quire of Paper) of the Conferences of the
Apparition and Mr. <hi>Towes.</hi> Mr. <hi>Elyot</hi> was
wont to say, that Mr. <hi>Towes</hi> was (not a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
or did trouble himself much about a
Religion, but was) a Man of great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi> did farther inform
me that Major General <hi>Middleton</hi> (since
Lord) went into the <hi>Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
to endeavour to make a Party for King
<hi>Charles</hi> the First. An Old Gentleman (that
was second-sighted) came and told him
that his endeavour was good; but he would
be unsuccessful, and moreover, <hi>That they
would put the King to Death: and that several
other Attempts would be made, but all in vain:
But that his Son would come in, but not Reign;
but at last would be Restored.</hi> This Lord
<hi>Middleton</hi> had a great Friendship with the
Laird <hi>Bocconi,</hi> and they had made an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That the first of them that Died,
should appear to he other in extremity.
The Lord <hi>Middleton</hi> was taken Prisoner at
<hi>Worcester</hi> Fight, and was Prisoner in the
<hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> under Three Locks. Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Bed pensive, <hi>Bocconi</hi> appeared
to him; my Lord <hi>Middleton</hi> asked him if
he were dead or alive? he said, Dead, and
that he was a Ghost; and told him, that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54241:37"/>
within Three Days he should escape, and he
did so, in his Wives Cloaths. When he
had done his Message, he gave a Frisk, and
said,
<q>
                     <l>Givenni givanni 'tis very strange,</l>
                     <l>In the World to see so sudden a Change.</l>
                  </q>
And then gathered up and vanished. This
Account Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi> had from the
Bishop of <hi>Edenborough.</hi> And this, and the
former Account he hath Writ in a Book of
Miscellanies, which I have seen, [and is
now reposited (with other Books of his) in
the <hi>Musaeum</hi> at <hi>Oxford.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno. 1670,</hi> not far from <hi>Cyrencester,</hi>
was an Apparition: Being demanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a good Spirit, or a bad? returned no
answer, but disappeared with a curious
Perfume and most melodious Twang. Mr.
<hi>W. Lilly</hi> believes it was a Farie.</p>

               <p>The Learned <hi>Hen. Iacob,</hi> Fellow of <hi>Merton</hi>
College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> died at Dr. <hi>Iacob</hi>'s M. D.
House in <hi>Canterbury.</hi> About a Week after his
Death, the Doctor being in Bed and awake,
and the Moon shining bright, saw his Cousin
<hi>Henry</hi> standing by his Bed, in his Shirt, with
a white Cap on his Head, and his Beard
Mustaches turning up, as when he was alive.
The Doctor pinched himself and was sure he
was awaked: He turned to the other side,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54241:38"/>
from him; and after some time took courage
to turn the other way again towards him; and
<hi>Henry Iacob</hi> stood there still, he should have
spoken to him, but he did not; for which
he has been ever since sorry. About half
an Hour after, he vanished. Not long after
this, the Cook Maid, going to the Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile

This Account I had in a Letter from
Dr. <hi>Iacob 1673,</hi> relating to his Life, for
Mr. <hi>Anthony Word;</hi> which is now in his
Hands.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Henry Iacob</hi> died, he would fain
have spoken to the Doctor but could not,
his Tongue faltered. 'Tis imagin'd, he
would have told Doctor <hi>Iacob,</hi> with what
Person he had deposited his Manuscripts of
his own Writing: (they were all the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
he had) 'tis suspect'd that one had them
and Printed them under his own Name.

               <p>Mr. <hi>T. M.</hi> an old Acquaintance of mine
hath assured me, that about a quarter of a
Year after his first Wives death, as he lay
in Bed awake with his little Grand-child, his
Wife opened the Closet-door, and came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Chamber to the Bed-side, and looked
upon him, and stooped down and Kissed
him; her Lips were warm, he fancied they
would have been cold. He was about to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54241:38"/>
have embraced her, but was afraid it might
have done him hurt. When she went
from him, he asked her when he should
see her again? she turned about and smil'd,
but said nothing. The Closet-door striked,
as it uses to do, both at her coming in and
going out. He had every Night a great
Coal-fire in his Chamber, which gave a
light as clear almost as a Candle. (He was
Hypocondrical.) He Marry'd two Wives
since; the later end of his Life was uneasie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno. 165 ...</hi> At—in the <hi>Moorlands</hi> in
<hi>Staffordshire,</hi> lived a poor Old Man, who
had been a long time Lame. One <hi>Sunday</hi>
in the Afternoon he being alone, one knock'd
at his Door: He bade him open it, and
come in. The Stranger desir'd a Cup of
Beer: The Lame Man desir'd him to take a
Dish and draw some, for he was not able to
do it himself. The Stranger ask'd the poor
Old Man, how long he had been Ill? The
poor Man told him. Said the Stranger I can
Cure you. Take two or Three Balm-leaves
steep'd in your Beer for a Fortnight, or three
Weeks, and you will be restor'd to your
Health: But Constantly and Zealously
serve God. The poor Man did so, and became
perfectly well. This Stranger was in a Purple
shag-gown, such as was not seen or known
in those parts: And no body in the street
(after Even-song) did see any one in such a
colour'd Habit. Dr. <hi>Gilbert Sheldon,</hi> (since
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54241:39"/>
Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) was then in the
<hi>Moorlands,</hi> and justified the truth of this, to
<hi>Elias Ashmole</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> from whom I had this
Account: And he hath inserted it in some
of his Memoirs, which are in the <hi>Musaeum</hi>

I was told by Mr. <hi>W. Haws</hi>
(who now lives with Sir <hi>William Fleetwood</hi>

the Mannor-house, for Selling the King's
Lands, were frighted by strange Apparitions;
and that the Four Surveyors which were sent
to Measure the Park, and Lodged themselves
with some other Companions in the Mannor, were
pelted out of their Chambers by Stones thrown
in at the Windows (but from what Hands the
Stones came they could not see) that their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
were continually put out as fast as they lighted
them; and that one with his Sword drawn to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
a Candle, was with his own Scabbard in the

or for fear, he fell Sick, and the others forc'd to
remove; some of them to Sir <hi>William Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's</hi>

               <p>One <hi>Lambert</hi> a Gun-Smith at <hi>Hereford,</hi>
was at <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> to mend and put in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Ammunition of that County before
the first Expedition to <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was
1639. He was then a Young Man, and
walking on the Sand by the Sea-side, a Man
comes to him (he did verily believe it was a
Man) and ask'd him, if he knew <hi>Hereford?</hi>
Yes, quoth he, I am a <hi>Hereford</hi> Man. Do
you know it well, quoth the other? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly

                  <q>That City

               <p>—A Minister, who lived by Sir <hi>Iohn
Warre</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire</hi> about 1665, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the Park to give Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> a Visit,
was rencountred by a Venerable Old
Man, who said to him, <q>Prepare your
self for such a Day (which was about
three Days after) You shall die.</q> The
Minister told Sir <hi>Iohn Warre</hi> and my Lady
this Story, who heeded it not: On the
Morning fore-warn'd Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> calls upon the
Parson early to Ride a Hunting, and to
Laugh at his prediction: His Maid went
up to call him and found him stark Dead.
This from my Lady <hi>Katharine Henley,</hi> who
had it from my Lady <hi>Warre.</hi> But Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
in the Life of the Earl of <hi>Rochester,</hi>
makes it a Dream.</p>
               <p>This put me in mind of a Story in the
<hi>Legend, &amp;c.</hi> of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor
being forewarned of his Death by a Pilgrim,
to whom St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist reveal'd it:
for which the King gave the Pilgrim a rich
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54241:40"/>
Ring from off his Finger: And the event
answered. The Story is well Painted in
Glass, in a Window of the <hi>South</hi> Isle of
<hi>Westmimster-Abbey</hi> (the next Window from
that over the Door that opens into the <hi>West</hi>
walk of the Cloyster) it is the best Window
in the Church: Underneath the Two Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
<hi>viz.</hi> of the King and the Pilgrim
are these following Verses, <hi>Viz.</hi>

               <p>Dr.—<hi>Twiss</hi> Minister of the New
Church at <hi>Westminster</hi> told me that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
[Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> Prolocutor of the Assembly
of Divines, and Author of <hi>Vindiciae</hi>] when
he was a School-boy at <hi>Winchester,</hi> saw the
<hi>Phantome</hi> of a Schoolfellow of his deceased
[a Rakebell] who said to him, <hi>I am damned.</hi>
This was the occasion of Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> [the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers]
Conversion, who had been before
that time (as he told his Son) a very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Boy, [He was Hypochondriacal]. There
is a story like this, of the Conversion of St.
<hi>Bruno,</hi> by an Apparition: Upon which he
became mighty devout, and founded the
Order of the <hi>Carthusians.</hi>

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> 
                  <hi>R. S. S.</hi> shewed us at
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54241:41"/>
the <hi>Royal-Society,</hi> a Note under Mr. <hi>Smyth</hi>'s
Hand [the Curate of <hi>Deptford</hi>] that in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember
1679,</hi> as he was in bed sick of an
Ague, came to him the Vision of a Master
of Arts, with a white Wand in his Hand:
And told him, that, if he did lie on his
back three Hours, <hi>viz.</hi> from ten to one,
that he should be rid of his Ague. He lay
a good while on his back; but at last being
weary he turned, and immediately the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
attacqued him afterwards, he strictly
followed the Direction, and was perfectly
cured. He was awake, and it was in the
day-time.</p>
               <p>This puts me in mind of a Dream of old
<hi>Farmer Good,</hi> a Neighbour of mine at <hi>Broad-Chalk,</hi>
who being ill, dreamt that he met
with an old Friend of his (long since deceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
by <hi>Knighton-Ashes</hi> (in that Parish)
who told him that if he rose out of his Bed,
that he would die. He awaked and rose
to make Water, and was immediateiy seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a shivering Fit, and died of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
aged, 84.</p>
               <p>The Lady Viscountess <hi>Maidston</hi> told me,
she saw (as it were) a Fly of Fire, fly round
about her in the dark, half an hour before
her Lord died: He was killed at Sea: and
the like before her Mother in Law [the
Countess of <hi>Winchelseá</hi> died, [She was then
with Child.]</p>
               <p>A Dutch-Prisoner at <hi>Wood-bridge</hi> in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:54241:41"/>
in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II. could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Spirits; but others that stood by could
not. The Bell tolled for a Man newly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased.
The Prisoner saw his <hi>Phantôme,</hi>
and did descibe him to the Parson of the
Parish, who was with him;<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hooke</hi> the Parson of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, has often told this Story; of which I know many more Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</note> exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Man for whom the Bell tolled.
Says the Prisoner, now he is coming near
to you, and now he is between you and
the Wall, the Parson was resolved to try
it, and went to take the Wall of him, and
was thrown down; but could see nothing.
This story is credibly told by several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vavasor Powell</hi> saw several Apparitions.
See page 8. <hi>of his Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a very remarkable story of an
Apparition, which <hi>Martin Luther</hi> did see.
Mentioned in his <hi>Commensalia,</hi> or Table-talk,
which see.</p>
               <p>Those that are delirous in high Fevers,
see [waking] Men and things that are not
there. I knew one Mr. <hi>M. L.</hi> that took
<hi>Opium,</hi> and he did see (being awake) Men
and things that were not present (or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
not in being. Those whose Spleens
are ill-affected have the like Phantasies.

whereof I shall here set down.</p>
               <p>The Countess of <hi>Thanet</hi> (Earl <hi>Iohn</hi>'s La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
saw as she was in Bed with her Lord
in <hi>London,</hi> her Daughter my Lady <hi>Hatton,</hi>

Kirby,</hi> the Candle was burning in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Last Book.</note>
Since <hi>viz. Anno.</hi> 167 ... this Lady <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
was Blown up with Gun-powder set on
Fire by Lightning, in the Castle at <hi>Garnsey,</hi>
where her Lord was Governor.</p>
               <p>The Beautiful Lady <hi>Diana Rich,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> as she was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in her Father's Garden at <hi>Kensington,</hi> to
take the fresh Air before Dinner, about
Eleven a Clock, being then very well, met
with her own Apparition, Habit and every
thing, as in a Looking glass. About a
Month after she died of the Small-pox.
And 'tis said, that her Sister the Lady <hi>Isabella
(Thinne)</hi> saw the like of her self also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she died. This Account I had from
a Person of Honour.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>E. W.</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>W. W.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms

her self <hi>(i. e.)</hi> her Phantome half a Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she died, for a quater of an Hour toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
She said further that her Aunt was sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fourteen Years before she died, and that
she walked Living, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> her Apparition,
and that she was seen by several at the same
time. The like is reported of others.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Trehern</hi> B. D. (Chaplain to Sir <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando
Bridgman</hi> Lord Keeper) a Learned and
sober Person, was the Son of a Shoe-maker
in <hi>Hereford:</hi> Gne Night as he lay in Bed,
the Moon shining very bright, he saw the
Phantome of one of the Apprentices sitting
in a Chair in his red Wastcoat, and Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
about his Head, and Strap upon his
Knee; which Apprentice was really abed
and asleep with another Fellow-apprentice
in the same Chamber, and saw him. The
Fellow was Living 1671. Another time,
as he was in Bed he saw a Basket come Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Air along by the Valence of his
Bed; I think he said there was Fruit in the
Basket: It was a Phantome. From him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>

the Chamberlain of the Inn,

               <p>I Captain <hi>Henry Bell</hi> do hereby declare
both to the present Age and also to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that being employed beyond the Seas
in <hi>State-affairs</hi> divers Years together, both
by King <hi>Iames,</hi> and also by the late King
<hi>Charles</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> I did hear and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
in all places great Bewailing and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
made, by reason of destroying
and burning of above <hi>Fourscore Thousand</hi> of
<hi>Martin Luther</hi>'s Books: Entitled, <hi>His last
Divine Discourses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which Divine Work or <hi>Discourses</hi>
the Reformation, begun before in <hi>Germany,</hi>
was wonderfully promoted and spred in
other Countrys.</p>
               <p>But afterward it so fell out, that the
Pope then living, <hi>viz. Gregory</hi> XIII. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
what great hurt and prejudice
he, and his Religion had already received
by reason of the said <hi>Luther</hi>'s Discourses,
and also fearing that the same might
bring further contempt and mischief upon
himself and his Church, he therefore to
prevent the same, did fiercely stir up and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54241:43"/>
instigate the Emperor then in being, <hi>viz.
Rodolphus</hi> III. to make an Edict through
the whole Empire, that all the foresaid
Printed Books should be burned, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that it should be <hi>Death</hi> for any Person
to have or keep a Copy thereof, but to
burn the same: Which <hi>Edict</hi> was speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put in Execution accordingly; insomuch
that not one of all the said Printed Books,
nor any one Copy of the same, could be
found out, or heard of in any place.</p>
               <p>Yet it pleased God, that in <hi>Anno</hi> 1626, a
<hi>German</hi> Gentleman named <hi>Casparus Van
Sparr,</hi> with whom in my stay in <hi>Germany</hi>
about King <hi>Iames</hi>'s business I became fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
known and acquainted, having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to build upon an old Foundation of
a House, wherein his Grand-father dwelt at
that time, when the said <hi>Edict</hi> was Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Germany,</hi> for the Burning of the said
Books, and digging deep into the ground
under the said old Foundation, one of the
said Original Printed Books was there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
found, lying in a deep obscure hole,
being wrapped in a strong Linnen Cloth,
which was waxed all over with Bees-wax
within and without: whereby the said
Book was perserved fair without any ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish.</p>
               <p>And at the same time <hi>Ferdinandus</hi> II. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> who was a severe
Enemy and Persecutor of the Protestant
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54241:44"/>
Religion, the foresaid Gentleman, and
Grand-child to him that had hidden the said
Book in that obscure hole, fearing that if
the said Emperor should get knowledge
that one of the said Books were yet forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming,
and in his custody, whereby not
only himself might be brought into trouble,
but also the Book be in danger to be destroy'd,
as all the rest were long before; and also
calling to mind that I had the high Dutch
Tongue very perfect, did send the said Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Book over hither into <hi>England</hi> unto me:

the said Book into <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon I took the said Book before
me, and many times began to Translate the
same, but always I was hindred therein, being
called upon about other Business; in so much
that by no possible means I could remain by
that work. Then about six Weeks after
I had receiv'd the said Book, it fell out, that
being in Bed with my Wife, one Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Twelve and one of the Clock, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asleep, but my self yet awake, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
unto me an Ancient Man, standing at
my Bed-side array'd all in White, having a
long and broad white Beard, hanging down
to his Girdle steed, who taking me by the
right Ear, spake these words following un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me; <hi>Sirrah, Will not you take time to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54241:44"/>
Translate that Book which is sent unto you out
of</hi> Germany? <hi>I will provide for you both place
and time to do it:</hi> And then he Vanish'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Whereupon being much affrighted, I fell
into an extream Sweat, insomuch that my
Wife awaking, and finding me all over wet,
she ask'd me what I ailed? I told her what
I had seen and heard; but I never did heed
or regard Visions nor Dreams. And so the
same fell soon out of my mind.</p>
               <p>Then about a Fortnight after I had seen
the Vision, on a <hi>Sunday</hi> I went to <hi>Whitehall</hi>
to hear the Sermon, after which ended, I
return'd to my Lodging which was then in
<hi>Kingstreet</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and sitting down
to Dinner with my Wife, two Messengers
were sent from the Council-board with a
Warrant to carry me to the Keeper of the
<hi>Gate-house</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> there to be safely
kept, until further Order from the Lords of
the Council; which was done without
shewing any Cause<note n="*" place="margin">Whatsoever was pretended, yet the true cause of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Commitment was, because he was urgent with the Ld. <hi>Treasurer</hi> for his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears: which amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a great Summ, he was not willing to pay, and to be freed from his clamours clapt him <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

I was Committed; upon
which said Warrant I was kept

where I spent Five Years
thereof about Translating of the
said Book: Insomuch as I found the
words very true which the Old
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54241:45"/>
Man in the aforesaid Vision said unto me, <hi>I
will shortly provide you both place and time to
Translate it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then after I had finish'd the Translation,
Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> sent to
me in the Prison by Dr. <hi>Bray</hi> his Chaplain
Ten Pounds, and desir'd to peruse the Book;
he afterwards sent him by Dr. <hi>Bray</hi> Forty
Pounds. There was a Committee of the
House of Commons for the Printing of this
Translation, which was in 1652.</p>

a <hi>Plebeian</hi> acquainted the Senate,
that passing one Night about Twelve a

him to let the Senate know the
<hi>Gauls</hi> were on their March to <hi>Rome.</hi>
How those things could be, it is to be
discoursed by Persons well versed in the
Causes of Natural and Supernatural
Events: For my part I will not pretend
to understand them, unles (according to
the Opinion of Some Philosophers) we
may believe, that the Air being full of
Intelligences and Spirits, who foreseee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
future Events, and commiserating
the Condition of Mankind, gives them
warning by these kind of Intimations,
that they may the more timely provide
and defend themselves against their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.
But what ever is the Cause,
Experience assures us, that after such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiations,
some extraordinary thing or
other does constantly happen.</p>

                  <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> had certainly this Afflatus.
One that I knew, that was at the Battle of
<hi>Dunbar,</hi> told me that <hi>Oliver</hi> was carried on
with a Divine Impulse; he did Laugh so
excessively as if he had been drunk; his
Eyes sparkled with Spirits. He obtained a
great Victory; but the Action was said to
be contrary to Human Prudence. The
same fit of Laughter seiz'd <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi>
just before the Battle of <hi>Naseby;</hi> as a Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of mine, and a great Favourite of his,
Colonel <hi>I. P.</hi> then present, testifi'd. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal

Action did agree with the very Time, Day

upon all Changes of Government; when

Means.</p>
               <p>By way of parallel to this, Pope—by
the like instinct, being at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory,
did speak of the Engagement in the

by a strong Impulse on his Spirit, that his

I had from <hi>Fabian Philips</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> of the

               <p>The Lord <hi>Roscomon,</hi> being a Boy of Ten
Years of age at <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> one day
was (as it were) madly extravagant in

They said, God grant this bodes
no ill Luck to him: In the heat of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Fit, he cries out, My Father is
Dead. A Fortnight after, News came from
<hi>Ireland,</hi> that his Father was Dead. This
Account I had from Mr. <hi>Knolls,</hi> who was
his Governor, and then with him; since
Secretary to the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and I have
heard his Lordships Relations confirm the
same.</p>
               <p>A very good Friend of mine and old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
hath had frequent Impulses:
When he was a Commoner at <hi>Trin.</hi> College
<hi>Oxford,</hi> he had several. When he rode to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>West</hi> one time in the Stage-Coach,
he told the Company, We shall certainly
be Robbed, and they were so. When a
Brother of his a Merchant died, he left him
with other Effects, a share of a Ship, which
was returning from <hi>Spain,</hi> and of which
News was brought to the <hi>Exchange</hi> at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
of her good Condition; he had such an
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54241:49"/>
Impulse upon his Spirit, that he must needs
Sell his share, though to loss; and he did
Sell it. The Ship came safe to <hi>Cornwal</hi> (or
<hi>Devon)</hi> and somewhere afterwards fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Rocks and sunk: Not a Man Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished;
but all the Goods were lost except
some Parrets, which were brought for

               <p>The Learned Dr. <hi>Iohn Pell,</hi> hath told

there was a Prophet among the Salvages in

of Strangers in Ships, which they had not
known.</p>
               <p>The Prophecies of St. <hi>Malachi,</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
strange. He describes the Popes
by their Coats of Arms, or their Names, or
their Manners: If his Prohecies be true,
there will be but 15 Popes more. It is

               <p>Mr. <hi>Lancelot Morehouse</hi> in the time of the
Civil Wars, rescued a sheet of Parchment
in <hi>Quarto</hi> most delicately Writ, from a Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor's
Sheers. It was part of a Book, and
was a Prophecy concerning <hi>England</hi> in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Hexameters;</hi> I saw it 1649. It pointed
at our late Troubles: He gave it to <hi>Seth
Ward,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and is lost among

               <p>In a Book of Mr. <hi>William Lilly</hi>'s are Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphick
Prophecies, <hi>viz.</hi> of the great
Plague of <hi>London,</hi> expressed by Graves and
dead Corps; and a Scheme with ♊ ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
[the Sign of <hi>London]</hi> and no Planets in

of <hi>London</hi> all on Fire, also Moles creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> perhaps Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> might be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54241:51"/>
to have People believe that this was
from himself. But Mr. <hi>Thomas Flatman</hi>
(Poet) did affirm, that he had seen those
Hieroglyphicks in an old Parchment Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
Writ in the time of the Monks.</p>
               <p>In the Nave of the Cathedral Church at
<hi>Wells,</hi> above the Capitals of two Pillars, are
the Head of the King, and the Head of a
Bishop: It was fore-told, that when a
King should be like that King, and a Bishop
like that Bishop; that Abbots should be
put down, and Nuns should Marry: Above
the Arch, is an Abbot or Monk with his
Head hanging downwards; and a Nun with
Children about her. The inside of the Arch
is Painted Blew, and adorned with Stars,
to signifie the Power and Influence of the
Stars. This Prophecy was Writ in Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and hung in a Table on one of those
Pillars, before the Civil-Wars. Dr. <hi>Duck</hi>
(who was Chancellor of <hi>Wells)</hi> said, that
he had seen a Copy of it among the Records
of the <hi>Tower</hi> at <hi>London.</hi> It was Prophecy'd
300 Years before the Reformation. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Knight,</hi> was Bishop here at the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and the Picture (they say) did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
him.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Spanish</hi> History it is mentioned,
that a Vault being open'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> they
found there <hi>Moors</hi> Heads, and some Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that did express, When People resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
those Heads should come into <hi>Spain,</hi>

they would Conquer that Country: And it
was so. See this Story more at large in

               <p>There is a Prophecy of <hi>William Tyndal,</hi>
poor Vicar of <hi>Welling</hi> in the County of
<hi>Hertford,</hi> made in the beginning of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign. I have seen it: It is in
<hi>English</hi> Verse, two Pages and an half in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio.

his Fathers was also a seventh Son; but he
could do no Cures at all. I am very well

one (a Painter) of <hi>Stowel</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire</hi> near
<hi>Bridgewater,</hi> had a Wenn in the inside of
his Cheek, as big as a Pullets Egg, which
by the advice of one was Cur'd by once or
twice Touching or Rubbing with a dead
Womans Hand, <hi>(è contra,</hi> to Cure a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
a dead Man's Hand) He was directed
first to say the Lord's Prayer, and to beg a
Blessing. He was perfectly Cured in a few
Weeks. I was at the Man's House who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
it to me, as also to the Reverend Mr.
<hi>Andrew Paschal,</hi> who went with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Davys Mell</hi> (the famous Violinist,

that was Cured after the manner
aforesaid, which Dr. <hi>Ridgely</hi> M. D. of the
College of Physitians, averr'd in my
hearing.</p>
               <p>The Curing of the <hi>Kings-evil</hi> by the
Touch of the King, does much puzzel our
Philosophers: For whether our Kings were
of the House of <hi>York,</hi> or <hi>Lancaster,</hi> it did the
Cure <hi>(i. e.)</hi> for the most part. ('Tis true
indeed at the Touching there are Prayers
Read, but perhaps, neither the King attends
them nor his Chaplains.)</p>
               <p>In <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> 'tis confidently reported,
that some were Cured of the <hi>Kings-evil,</hi> by

<hi>Carisbrook</hi> Castle, there was a Woman
Touched by him, who had the <hi>Kings-evil</hi>
in her Eye, and had not seen in a Fortnight
before, her Eye-lids being glued together:
As they were at Prayers (after the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
the Womans Eyes opened. Mr. <hi>Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Bowman,</hi> with many others were Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses
of this.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Stretton</hi> in <hi>Herefordshire</hi> in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1648.
when King <hi>Charles</hi> I. was Prisoner, the
Tenant of the Mannor-house there, sold
excellent Cider to Gentlemen of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood;
where they met privately, and
could Discourse freely, and be merry, in
those Days so troublesome to the Loyal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Among others that met, there was
old Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> B. D. Parson of the Parish,
<hi>Quondam</hi> Fellow of <hi>Brason-nose</hi> College in
<hi>Oxford:</hi> This Venerable good old Man, one
Day (after his accustomed fashion) stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, with his Head uncover'd to Drink
his Majesties Health, saying, <hi>God bless our
gracious Sovereign,</hi> as he was going to put
the Cup to his Lips, a Swallow flew in at
the Window, and pitched on the brim of
the little Earthen-cup (not half a Pint) and
sipt, and so flew out again. This was in the
presence of the aforesaid Parson <hi>Hill,</hi> Major
<hi>Gwillim,</hi> and two or three more, that I knew
very well then, my Neighbours, and whose
joint Testimony of it I have had more
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54241:57"/>
than once, in that very Room. It was in the
Bay-window in the Parlour there; Mr. <hi>Hill</hi>'s
Back was next to the Window. I cannot
doubt of the veracity of the Witnesses. This
is Printed in some Book that I have seen, I
think in Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi>'s Worthies. The Cup
is preserved there still, as a Rarity.</p>
               <p>In Dr. <hi>Bolton</hi>'s Sermons is an Account of
the Lady <hi>Honywood,</hi> who despaired of her
Salvation. Dr. <hi>Bolton</hi> endeavour'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
her: Said she, (holding a <hi>Venice</hi>-glass in
her Hand) I shall as certainly be Damned,
as this Glass will be broken: And at that
word, threw it hard on the Ground; and
the Glass remained sound; which did give
her great comfort. The Glass is yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
among the <hi>Cimelia</hi> of the Family.
This Lady lived to see Descended from her

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> had an ugly Scab that grew on
the middle of his Forehead, which had been
there for some Years, and he could not be
Cured; it became so nauseous, that he
would see none but his intimate Friends:
He was a Learned Gentleman, a Chimist
and Antiquary: His custom was, once eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Summer to Travel to see Cathedrals, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys,
Castles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In his Journey, being
come to <hi>Peterborough,</hi> he dreamt there, that
he was in a Church and saw a Hearse, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54241:57"/>
that one did bid him wet his Scab, with the
drops of the Marble. The next Day he
went to Morning-Service, and afterwards
going about the Church, saw the very
Hearse (which was of Black Say, for Queen
<hi>Katharine,</hi> Wife to King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.) and
the Marble Grave-Stone by. He found drops
on the Marble, and there were some Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
wherein he dip'd his Finger, and wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Scab: In Seven Days it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
Cured. This accurate and certain
Information, I had from my worthy Friend
<hi>Elias Ashmole</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> who called Mr. <hi>Backhouse</hi>

                  <hi>Arise Evans</hi> had a fungous Nose, and said,

coming of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. into St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s
Park he Kiss'd the King's Hand, and rubb'd
his Nose with it; which disturb'd the King,
but Cured him. Mr. <hi>Ashmole</hi> told me.</p>

in the Pasture behind <hi>Montague</hi>-House, it
was XII a Clock. I saw there about two
or three and twenty young Women, most
of them well Habited, on their Knees very
busie, as if they had been Weeding. I
could not presently learn what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was; at last a young Man told me, that
they were looking for a Coal under the Root
of a Plantain, to put under their Heads that
Night, and they should Dream who would
be their Husbands: It was to be found
that Day, and Hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:54241:59"/>The Women have several Magical Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
handed down to them by Tradition,
for this purpose, as, on St. <hi>Agnes</hi> Night,
21 Day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> Take a row of Pins,
and pull out every one, one after another,
saying a <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> or Our Father, stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Pin in your Sleeve, and you will Dream
of him or her you shall Marry. <hi>Ben. Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
in one of his Masques, makes some men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>And on sweet Saint <hi>Agnes</hi> Night</l>
                  <l>Please you with the promis'd sight,<note place="margin">'Tis Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Night, falsely.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>Some of Husbands, some of Lovers,</l>
                  <l>Which an empty Dream discovers.</l>
                  <l>Another. To know whom one shall Marry.</l>
               </q>
               <p>You must lie in another County, and
knit the left Garter about the Right Legg'd
Stockin (let the other Garter and Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
alone) and as you rehearse these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Verses, at every Comma, knit a
Knot.
<q>
                     <l>This Knot I knit,</l>
                     <l>To know the thing I know not yet,</l>
                     <l>That I may see</l>
                     <l>The Man (Woman) that shall my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
(Wife) be,</l>
                     <l>How he goes and what he wears</l>
                     <l>And what he does all the Days.</l>
                  </q>
Accordingly in your Dream you will see
him; if a Musitian, with a Lute or other
Instrument; if a Scholar, with a Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>A Gentlewoman that I knew, confessed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54241:59"/>
in my hearing, that she used this Method,
and dreamt of her Husband whom she had
never seen: About Two or three Years
after, as she was on <hi>Sunday</hi> at Church, up
pops a young <hi>Oxonian</hi> in the Pulpit: She
cries out presently to her Sister, This is the
very Face of the Man that I saw in my
Dream. Sir <hi>William Somes</hi> Lady did the
like.</p>
               <p>Another way is,<note place="margin">Some say any other New Moon is as good.</note> to Charm the Moon
thus; At the first appearance of the new
Moon after New-years Day, go out in the
Evening, and stand over the Sparrs of a
Gate, or Stile, looking on the Moon and
say,
<q>
                     <l>All Hail to the Moon,<note place="margin">In <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> they kneel on a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast Stone.</note> all Hail to thee,</l>
                     <l>I prithee good Moon reveal to me,</l>
                     <l>This Night who my Husband (Wife) must be.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>You must presently after go to Bed.</p>
               <p>I knew two Gentlewomen, that did thus
when they were young Maids, and they
had Dreams of those that Married them.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Ashmole</hi> told me, that a Woman
made use of a Spell to Cure an Ague, by the
Advice of—A Minister came to her,
and severely repremanded her, for making
use of a Diabolical help, and told her, she
was in danger of Damnation for it, and
commanded her to burn it. She did so, and
her Distemper returned severely; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that she was importunate with the
Doctor to use the same again: She used
it, and had ease. But the Parson hearing of
it, came to her again, and thundred Hell
and Damnation, and frighted her so, that
she burnt it again. Whereupon she fell
extremely Ill, and would have had it a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54241:61"/>
Third time; but the Doctor refused, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That she had contemned and slighted
the power and goodness of the Blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
(or Angels) and so she died, The
cause of the Lady <hi>Honywoods</hi> Desparation,
was that she had used a Spell to Cure her.</p>

and rub it in the palm of your Hand all to
pieces; and having so done, piss on it, and
rub it in, and let it dry; then come to the
Beast and make water in your Hand, and
throw it in his Mouth. It Cures in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an Hours time. This rubbing serves
for a whole Year, and it is no danger to the
Hand. The chiefest Skill is to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Beast be Poisoned, or no. From

               <p>A House (or Chamber) somewhere in
<hi>London</hi> was Haunted; the Curtains would
be rashed at Night, and awake the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that lay there, who was Musical, and
a familiar acquaintance of <hi>Henry Laws. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Laws</hi> to be satisfied did lie with him; and
the Curtains were rashed so then: The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
grew lean and pale with the frights,
One Dr.—Cured the House of this distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
and Mr. <hi>Laws</hi> said, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Ingredient was <hi>Hypericon</hi> put under his
Pillow.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> and other parts, they
do put a cold Iron-bar upon their Barrels, to
preserve their Beer from being sowred by
Thunder. This is a common practice in
<hi>Kent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To hinder the Night-mare, they hang in
a string a Flint with a hole in it (naturally)
by the Manger; but best of all they say,
hung about their Necks, and a Flint will
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54241:63"/>
do it that hath not a hole in it. It is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Night-mare <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Hag from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their Horses, who will sometimes sweat
all Night. The Flint thus hung does hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Sp.</hi> told me that his Horse which was
Bewitch'd, would break Bridles and strong
Halters, like a <hi>Sampson.</hi> They fill'd a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
with the Horse's Urine, stop'd it with a
Cork and bound it fast in, and then bury'd
it under Ground: And the party suspected
to be the Witch fell ill, that he could not
make Water, of which he died. When
they took up the Bottle, the Urine was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
gone: So, that they did believe, that
if the Fellow could have lived a little longer,
he had recovered.</p>
               <p>It is a thing very common to nail Horse-shoes
on the Thresholds of Doors:<note place="margin">There are very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Stories of Witches in <hi>Gages</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the <hi>West-Indies</hi> of his own knowledg.</note> Which
is to hinder the power of Witches that enter
into the House. Most Houses of the <hi>West</hi>-end
of <hi>London</hi> have the Horse-shoe on the
Threshold. It should be a Horse-shoe that
one finds. In the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> they use to put
an Iron into the Fire when a Witch comes
in.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Paris</hi> when it begins to Thunder and
Lighten, they do presently Ring out the
great Bell at the Abbey of St. <hi>German,</hi> which
they do believe makes it cease. The like
was wont to be done heretofore in <hi>Wiltshire;</hi>
when it Thundred and Lightned, they did
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54241:63"/>
Ring St. <hi>Adelm</hi>'s Bell at <hi>Malmsbury</hi> Abbey.
The curious do say, that the Ringing of
Bells exceedingly disturbs Spirits.</p>

                     <p>I Last Week received a Letter from a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Friend, the Minister of <hi>Barnstable</hi> in
<hi>Devon,</hi> which I think worthy your perusal.
It was Dated <hi>May</hi> 3. 1683. and is as follows.
[He was of my time in <hi>Queens</hi> College in
<hi>Cambridge.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There having been many Prodigious
things perform'd lately in a Parish a join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that which Bishop <hi>Sparrow</hi> presented
me to, called <hi>Cheriton</hi> Bp by some discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
Daemon, I can easily remember that
I owe you an account thereof in lieu of that
which you desired of me, and which I could
serve you in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:54241:64"/>About <hi>November</hi> last, in the Parish of
<hi>Spreyton</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in a Field near the Dwelling-house
of <hi>Phil. Furze,</hi> to his Servant <hi>Francis Fry,</hi>
being of the age of 21 next <hi>August,</hi> an aged
Gentleman with a Pole in his Hand, and
like that he was wont to carry about with
him when living, to kill Moles withall, who
told the Young Man he should not be afraid
of him; but should tell his Master, <hi>i. e.</hi> his
Son, That several Legacies that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
were unpaid, naming 10 <hi>s.</hi> to one,
10 <hi>s.</hi> to another, <hi>&amp;c. Fry</hi> replied, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he last nam'd was Dead. The Spectrum
replied, he knew that, but said it must be
paid to—and named the next Relation,
These things being perform'd, he promised
he would trouble him no further. These
small Legacies were paid accordingly. But
the young Man having caried 20 <hi>s.</hi> order'd
by the Spectrum to his Sister Mrs. <hi>Furze</hi> of
the Parish of <hi>Staverton</hi> near <hi>Totness,</hi> which
Money the Gentlewoman refus'd to receive,
being sent her, as she said, from the Devil.
The same Night <hi>Fry</hi> lodging there, the
Spectrum appear'd to him again, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Fry</hi> challenged his promise not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him, and said he had done all he desir'd
him, but that Mrs. <hi>Furze</hi> would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Money. The Spectrum replied,
that's true indeed. But bid him ride to <hi>Tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and buy a Ring of that value, and that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54241:64"/>
she would take: Which was provided for her;
and receiv'd by her. Then <hi>Fry</hi> rode home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
attended by a Servant of Mrs. <hi>Furze.</hi>
But being come into <hi>Spreyton</hi> Parish, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a little before, he seem'd to carry an
old Gentlewoman behind him, that often
threw him off his Horse, and hurried him
with such violence, as astonish'd all that saw
him, or heard how horridly the Ground
was beaten; and being come into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
Yard, <hi>Fry</hi>'s Horse (a mean Beast)
sprung at once 25 Foot. The trouble from
the Man-Spectre ceased from this time.
But the old Gentlewoman Mrs. <hi>Furze,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Furze</hi>'s second Wife, whom the Spectre at
his first appearance to <hi>Fry,</hi> called, That
Wicked Woman my Wife, (though I knew
her, and took her for a very good Woman)
presently after appears to several in the
House, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Fry,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Thomasin Gidley,
Anne Langdon</hi> born in my Parish, and to a
little Child which was forced to be remov'd
from the House; sometimes in her own
shape, sometimes in shapes more horrid, as of
a Dog belching Fire, and of an Horse, and
seeming to ride out at the Window, carrying
only one pane of Glass away, and a little
piece of Iron. After this <hi>Fry</hi>'s Head was
thrust into a narrow space, where a Man's
Fist could not enter, between a Bed and a
Wall; and forced to be taken thence by the
strength of Men, all bruised and bloody;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54241:65"/>
upon this, it was thought fit to Bleed him;
and after that was done, the Binder was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
from his Arm, and convey'd about his
Middle, and presently was drawn so very
straight, it had almost killed him, and was
cut asunder making an ugly uncouth noise.
Several other times with Handkerchiefs, Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vats
and other things he was near strangled,
they were drawn so close upon his Throat.
He lay one Night in his Periwig (in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
Chamber, for the more safety) which
was torn all to pieces. His best Periwig he
inclosed in a little Box on the inside with a
Joind-stool, and other weight upon it; the
Box was snapp'd asunder, and the Wig torn
all to flitters. His Master saw his Buckles fall
all to pieces on his Feet: But, first I should
have told you the fate of his Shoe-strings,
one of which a Gentlewoman greater than all
exception, assured me that she saw it come
out of his Shoe, without any visible Hand,
and fling it self to the farther end of the
Room; the other was coming out too, but
that a Maid prevented and help'd it out,
which crisp'd and curl'd about her Hand like
a living Eel. The Cloaths worn by <hi>Anne
Langdon</hi> and <hi>Fry</hi> (if their own) were torn
to pieces on their backs. The same Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
being the Daughter of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Parish, Mr. <hi>Roger Specott,</hi> shewed
me one of <hi>Fry</hi>'s Gloves, which was torn in
his Pocket while she was by. I did view it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54241:65"/>
near and narrowly, and do seriously confess
that it is torn so very accurately in all the
Seams and in other places, and laid abroad
so artificially, and it is so dexterously tatter'd
(and all done in the Pocket in a Minutes
time) as nothing Human could have done it;
no Cutler could have made an Engine to do
it so. Other fantastical Freeks have been very
frequent, as, the marching of a great Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
full of Salt out of one Room into another;
an Andiron-laying it self over a Pan of Milk
that was scalding on the Fire, and two
Flitches of Bacon descending from the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
where they hung, and laid themselves
over that Andiron. The appearing of the
the Spectrum (when in her own shape) in
the same Cloaths, to seeming, which Mrs.
<hi>Furze</hi> her Daughter-in-law has on. The
intangling of <hi>Fry</hi>'s Face and Legs, about his
Neck, and about the Frame of the Chairs,
so as they have been with great difficulty
disengaged.</p>
                     <p>But the most Remarkable of all happen'd
in that Day that I passed by the Door in
my return hither, which was <hi>Easter</hi>-eve,
when <hi>Fry</hi> returning from Work (that little
he can do) he was caught by the Woman
Spectre by the Skirts of his Doublet, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into the Air; he was quickly mist by
his Master and the Workmen, and great
enquiry was made for <hi>Fran. Fry,</hi> but no
hearing of him; but about half an Hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54241:66"/>
                        <hi>Fry</hi> was heard Whistling and Singing in
a kind of a Quagmire. He was now affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
as he was wont to be in his Fits, so that
none regarded what he said; but coming
to himself an Hour after, he solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
That the Daemon carried him so
high that he saw his Master's House under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
him no bigger than an Hay-cock,
that he was in perfect sense and prayed God
not to suffer the Devil to destroy him; that
he was suddenly set down in that Quagmire.
The Workmen found one Shoe on one side
of the House, and the other Shoe on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side; his Periwig was espied next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hanging on the Top of a tall Tree. It
was soon observ'd, that <hi>Fry</hi>'s part of his
Body that had laid in the Mud, was much
benum'd, and therefore the next <hi>Saturday,</hi>
which was the Eve of <hi>Low-Sunday,</hi> they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him to <hi>Crediton</hi> to be let Blood; which
being done, and the Company having left
him for a little while, returning they found
him in a Fit, with his Fore-head all bruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and swoln to a great bigness, none being
able to guess how it came, till he recover'd
himself, and then he told them, That a
Bird flew in at the Window with a great
force, and with a Stone in it's Mouth
flew directly against his Fore-head. The
People looked for it, and found on the
Ground just under where he sat, not a Stone,
but a weight of Brass, or Copper, which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54241:66"/>
the People were breaking, and parting it
among themselves. He was so very ill, that
he could not ride but one Mile or little more
that Night, since which time I have not
heard of him, save that he was ill handled
the next Day, being <hi>Sunday.</hi> Indeed Sir you
may wonder that I have not Visited that
House, and the poor afflicted People; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
since I was so near, and passed by the
very Door: But besides that, they have
called to their assistance none but Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Ministers, I was not qualified to
be welcome there, having given Mr. <hi>Furze</hi>
a great deal of trouble the last Year about a
Conventicle in his House, where one of this
Parish was the Preacher. But I am very
well assured of the truth of what I have
written, and (as more appears) you shall
hear from me again.</p>
                     <p>I had forgot to tell you that <hi>Fry</hi>'s Mother
came to me, grievously bewailing the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
condition of her Son. She told me, that
the Day before he had five Pins thrust into
his Side. She ask'd, and I gave her the best
Advice I could. Particularly, that her Son
should declare all that the Spectre, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Woman gave him in Charge, for I
suspect, there is <hi>aliquid latens;</hi> and that she
should remove him thence by all means.
But I fear that she will not do it. For I hear
that <hi>Anne Langdon</hi> is come into my Parish
to her Mother, and that she is grievously
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54241:67"/>
troubled there. I might have written as
much of her, as of <hi>Fry,</hi> for she hath been
as ill treated, saving the Aerial Journey.
Her Fits and Obsessions seem to be greater,
for she Scrieches in a most Hellish tone.
<hi>Thomasin Gidley</hi> (though removed) is in
trouble, as I hear.</p>
                     <p>Sir this is all my Friend wrote. This Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
came inclosed in another from a Clergy-Man
my Friend, who lives in those parts.
He tells me, all the Relations he receives
from divers Persons living in <hi>Spreyton</hi> and the
Neighbouring Parishes agree with this. He
spake with a Gentleman of good fashion,
that was at <hi>Crediton</hi> when <hi>Fry</hi> was Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and saw the Stone that bruised his Fore-head;
but he did not call it Copper or Brass,
but said, it was a strange Mineral. That
Gentleman promised to make a strict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
on the place into all particulars and to
give him the result: Which my Friend
also promises me; with hopes that he shall
procure for me a piece of that Mineral sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which hurt his Fore-head.</p>
                     <p>The occasion of my Friends sending me
this Narrative, was my entreating him
sometime since to enquire into a thing of
this nature, that happen'd in <hi>Barnstable,</hi>
where he lives. An account was given to
me long since, it fills a Sheet or two, which
I have by me: And to gratifie Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi>
who is Collecting Histories for his <hi>Sadducism.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54241:67"/>
Triumphatus.</hi> I desir'd to have it well attested,
it being full of very memorable things; but
it seems he could meet only a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
as to the truth of the things; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
varying in the Circumstances.</p>

                     <opener>
                        <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I received yours Dated <hi>May</hi> 24 1694. in
which you desire me to send you some
instances and examples of Transportation
by an invisible Power. The true cause of
my delaying so long to reply to that Letter,
was not want of Kindness; but of fit Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
for such a Reply.</p>
                     <p>As soon as I read your Letter of <hi>May</hi> 24
I called to mind a Story which I heard long
ago, concerning one of the Lord <hi>Duffus</hi> (in
the Shire of <hi>Murray</hi>) his Predecessors, of
whom it is reported, That upon a time,
when he was walking abroad in the Fields
near to his own House, he was suddenly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away, and found the next Day at <hi>Paris</hi>
in the <hi>French</hi> King's Cellar with a Silver Cup
in his Hand; that being brought into the
King's Presence and question'd by him, Who
he was? And how he came thither? He
told his name, his Country, and the place of
his Residence, and that on such a Day of the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54241:68"/>
Month (which proved to be the Day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
preceeding) being in the Fields,
he heard the noise of a Whirl-wind, and of
Voices crying Horse and Hattock (this is
the Word, which the Fairies are said to use
when they remove from any place) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he cried (Horse and Hattock) also,
and was immediately caught up, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
through the Air, by the Fairies to
that place, where after he had Drunk hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
he fell a-sleep, and before he awoke, the
rest of the Company were gone, and had left
him in the posture wherein he was found.
It's said, the King gave him the Cup which
was found in his Hand, and dismis'd
him.</p>
                     <p>This Story (if it could be sufficiently
attested) would be a noble Instance for
your purpose, for which cause I was at some
pains to enquire into the truth of it, and
found the means to get the present Lord
<hi>Duffus</hi>'s opinion thereof; which shortly is,
That there has been, and is such a Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but that he thinks it fabulous; this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it, his Lordship had from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who told him, that he had it from his
Father, the present Lord's Grandfather,
There is yet an old Silver-Cup in his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Possession still, which is called the
Fairy Cup; but has nothing Engraven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it except the Arms of the Family.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:54241:68"/>The Gentleman by whose means I
came to know the Lord <hi>Duffus</hi> his sentiment
of the forgoeing story, being Tutor to his
Lordships eldest Son, told me another lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
passage of the same nature, whereof he
was an Eye witness. He reports, that when
he was a Boy at School in the Town of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
yet not so Young, but that he had
Years and Capacity, both to observe and
remember that which fell out; he and his
School-fellows were upon a time whipping
their Tops in the Church-yard before the
Door of the Church; though the Day was
calm, they heard a noise of a Wind, and
at some distance saw the small Dust be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to arise and turn round, which motion
continued, advancing till it came to the
place where they were; whereupon they
began to Bless themselves: But one of
their number (being it seems a little more
bold and confident than his Companions)
said, Horse and Hattock with my Top, and
immediately they all saw the Top lifted up
from the Ground; but could not see what
way it was carried, by reason of a Cloud
of Dust which was raised at the same time:
They sought for the Top all about the place
where it was taken up, but in vain; and it
was found afterwards in the Church-yard,
on the other side of the Church. Mr.
<hi>Steward</hi> (so is the Gentleman called) decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to me that he had a perfect remembrance
of this matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:54241:69"/>The following Account I received <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
last, from Mr. <hi>Alexander Mowat</hi> a
Person of great Integrity and Judgment,
who being Minister at the Church at <hi>Lesly,</hi>
in the Shire of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> was turned out for
refusing the Oath of Test, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1681. He
informs, That he heard the late Earl of
<hi>Cathnes</hi> who was Married to a Daughter of
the late Marquess of <hi>Argyle</hi> tell the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Story, <hi>viz.</hi> That upon a time, when
a Vessel which his Lordship kept for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home Wine and other Provisions for
his House, was at Sea; a common Fellow,
who was reputed to have the Second-sight,
being occasionally at his House; the Earl
enquired of him, where his Men (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those in the Ship) were at that present
time? The Fellow replied, at such a place, by
name, within four Hours Sailing of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
which was not far from the place of his
Lordship's Residence: The Earl asked, what
Evidence he could give for that? The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
replied, that he had lately been at the
place, and had brought away with him
one of the Sea-mens Caps, which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to his Lordship. At the four Hours
end the Earl went down himself to the
Harbour, where he found the Ship newly
arrived, and in it one of the Seamen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Cap; who being questioned, how
he came to lose his Cap? Answered, that
at such a place (the same the Second-sight'd
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54241:69"/>
Man had named before) there arose a
Whirl-wind which endangered the Ship,
and carried away his Cap: The Earl
asked, if he would know his Cap when he
saw it? He said he would; whereupon
the Earl produced the Cap, and the Seaman
owned it for that, which was taken from
him.</p>
                     <p>This is all the Information which I
can give at present concerning Transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by an invisible Power. I am sorry that
I am able to contribute so little to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of so curious a piece as it seems your

I have given Instructions to an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

               <p>There are certain Formula's of Prayer

this, and the Prayer. Also there is the

               <p>
                  <hi>Iames Harrington</hi> [Author of <hi>Oceana</hi>]
told me that the Earl of <hi>Denbigh</hi> then
Ambassador at <hi>Venice</hi> did tell him, that
one did shew him there several times in
a Glass, things past, and to come.</p>
               <p>When Sir <hi>Mermaduke Langdale</hi> was in
<hi>Italy,</hi> he went to one of those <hi>Magi,</hi> who
did shew him a Glass, where he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
kneeling before a Crucifix: He was
then a Protestant; afterwards he became
a Roman Catholick. He told Mr. <hi>Thomas
Henshaw</hi> R. S. S. this himself.</p>
               <p>I have here set down the Figure of a
Consecrated <hi>Berill,</hi> now in the possession
of Sir <hi>Edward Harley</hi> Knight of the <hi>Bath,</hi>

<hi>Norfolk;</hi> a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
had it there,
and a Call was to
be used with it.
Afterwards a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
had it, and both
did work great
Cures with it (if
Curable) and in the
<hi>Berill</hi> they did see,
either the Receipt
in Writing, or else
the Herb. To this
Minister the Spirits
or Angels would
appear openly, and
because the Miller
(who was his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Friend) one day
happened to see
them, he gave him
the aforesaid Berill
and Call: By these
Angels the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
was forewarned of his Death. This
Account I had from Mr. <hi>Ashmole.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this Berill came into somebodies

things by it; insomuch that at last he was

               <p>A Cloathier's Widow of <hi>Pembridge</hi> in

the Canons of the Church of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and
Rector of <hi>Pembridge]</hi> to look over her
Husbands Writings after his Decease: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other things, he found a Call for a
Crystal. The Clothier had his Clothes
oftentimes stolen from his Racks; and at
last obtain'd this Trick to discover the
Thieves. So when he lost his Clothes,
he went out about Midnight with his
Crystal and Call, and a little Boy, or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Maid with him [for they say it must
be a pure Virgin] to look in the Crystal,
to see the likeness of the Person that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Theft. The Doctor did burn
the Call, 1671.</p>

               <p>About the later end of the Reign of King
<hi>Iames</hi> the First, one—a Taylor in
<hi>London</hi> had several Visions, which he did
describe to a Painter to paint, and he writ
the description himself in an ill, Taylor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

It was (at least) a Quire of Paper. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

               <p>DR. <hi>Richard Nepier</hi> was a Person of
great Abstinence, Innocence, and
Piety: He spent every day two Hours in
Family Prayer: When a Patient, or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
came to him, he presently went to
his Closet to Pray: and told to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Recovery, or Death of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
It appears by his Papers, that he
did converse with the Angel <hi>Raphael,</hi> who
gave him the Responses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elias Ashmole</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> had all his Papers,

Fifty Years; which he, Mr. <hi>Ashmole,</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
bound up, according to the Year
of our Lord, in—Volumes in <hi>Folio;</hi>
which are now reposited in the Library

which Mr. <hi>Ashmole</hi> said, was <hi>Responsum

               </p>
               <p>In these Papers are many excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
or Receipts for several Diseases
that his Patients had; and before some of
them is the aforesaid Mark. Mr. <hi>Ashmole</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:54241:74"/>
took the pains to Transcribe fairly with his
own hand all the Receipts; they are about
a Quire and half of Paper in <hi>Folio,</hi> which
since his Death were bought of his Relict

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> R. S. S.</p>
               <p>The Angel told him, if the Patient were
curable, or incurable.</p>
               <p>There are also several other Queries to
the Angel, as to Religion, Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I have forgot. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
one is, Whether the Good Spirits, or

Good</p>
               <p>It is to be found there, that he told <hi>Iohn
Prideaux</hi> D. D. <hi>Anno</hi> 1621, that Twenty
Years hence [1641] he would be a Bishop,
and he was so, <hi>sc.</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>R <abbr>Ris</abbr>, did resolve him, That Mr. <hi>Booth</hi>

should inherit, Three Years hence [<hi>Sc.</hi>
Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> the first Lord <hi>Delamere</hi>]
<hi>viz.</hi> from 1619. Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> aforesaid
was born <hi>December 18. Anno</hi> 1622.</p>
               <p>This I extracted out of Dr. <hi>Nepiers</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<hi>Diary,</hi> then in the possession of Mr.
<hi>Ashmole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>E. W.</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> was about Eight
Years old, he was troubled with the
Worms: His Grand-father carried him to
Dr. <hi>Nepier</hi> at <hi>Lynford.</hi> Mr. <hi>E. W.</hi> peeped
in at the Closet at the end of the Gallery,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54241:74"/>
and saw him upon his Knees at Prayer.
The Doctor told Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> that at Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years old his Grandson would be
freed from that Distemper: and he was so.
The Medicine he prescribed was, to drink
a little draught of Muscadine in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
'Twas about 1625.</p>
               <p>It is impossible, that the Prediction of
Sir <hi>George Booth</hi>'s Birth, could be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other way, but by Angelical Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This Dr. <hi>Richard Nepier</hi> was Rector
of <hi>Lynford</hi> in <hi>Bucks,</hi> and did Practise
Physick; but gave most to the Poor that he
got by it. 'Tis certain, he foretold his own
Death to a Day and Hour; he dyed Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon his Knees, being of a very great
Age, 1634. <hi>April</hi> the First. He was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
related to the Learn'd Lord <hi>Nepier</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
of <hi>M.</hi> ... in <hi>Scotland;</hi> I have forgot
whether his Brother. His Knees were hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
with frequent Praying. He left his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
to Sir <hi>Richard Nepier</hi> M. D. of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of Physitians <hi>London,</hi> from whom Mr.
<hi>Ashmole</hi> had the Doctor's Picture, now in
the <hi>Musaeum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Richard Nepier</hi> Rector of <hi>Lynford</hi> was
a good Astrologer, and so was Mr. <hi>Marsh</hi>
of <hi>Dunstable;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Marsh</hi> did seriously
confess to a Friend of mine, that Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
was but the Countenance; and that he
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54241:75"/>
did his business by the help of the blessed
Spirits; with whom only Men of great Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
Humility and Charity, could be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted:
And such a one he was. He was
an Hundred Years old when my Friend was
with him; and yet, did understand him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
very well.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Ashridge</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> near
<hi>Berkhamsted,</hi> was a Monastery, (now in the
Possession of the Earl of <hi>Bridgwater,)</hi> where
are excellent good old Paintings still to be
seen. In this Monastery was found an old
Manuscript Intituled <hi>Iohannes de Rupescissâ,</hi>
since Printed (or part of it) a Chimical
Book, wherein are many Receipts; among
others, To free a House Haunted with Evil
Spirits, by Fumes: Mr. <hi>Marsh</hi> had it, and
did Cure Houses so Haunted by it. <hi>Ovid</hi> in
his Festivals hath something like it. See
<hi>Thesaurus Exorcismorum</hi> writ by—
<hi>è Societate Iesu. Oct.</hi> Wherein are several
high Physical and Medicinal things.</p>
               <p>Good Spirits are delighted and allured by
sweet Perfumes, as rich Gums, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was the reason
that the Priests of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the <hi>Christians</hi> used them in their Temples,
and Sacrifices: And on the contrary, Evil
Spirits are pleased and allured and called up
by Suffumigations of <hi>Henbane, &amp;c.</hi> stinking
Smells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Witches do use in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54241:75"/>
their Conjuration. Toads (Saturnine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals)
are kill'd by putting of Salt upon
them; I have seen the Experiment. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Writers say, that Cedar-wood drives
away evil Spirits; it was, and is much used
in Magnificent Temples.</p>

Some did observe in the late Civil
Wars, that the Parliament, after a Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
did shortly obtain a Victory. And
as a three-fold Chord is not easily broken;
so when a whole Nation shall conjoin in
fervent Prayer and Supplication, it shall
produce wonderful Effects. <hi>William Lawd</hi>
(Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury)</hi> in a Sermon

affirms the power of Prayer to be so great,
That though there be a Conjunction or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

to meet, the Corpses will the like; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of these Candles are seen to turn some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a little out of the way, or path, that
leadeth to the Church, the following
Corps will be forced to turn in that very
place, for the avoiding some dirty Lane,
or plash, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now let us fall to Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Being about the Age of Fifteen,
dwelling at <hi>Lanylar,</hi> late at Night, some
Neighbour saw one of these Candles ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
up and down along the River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bank,
until they were weary in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, at last they left it so, and went to
Bed. A few Weeks after came a proper
Damsel from <hi>Montgomery-shire,</hi> to see her
Friends, who dwelt on the other side of
that River <hi>Istwith,</hi> and thought to Ford
the River at that very place where the
Light was seen; being dissuaded by some
lookers on (some it is most likely of those
that saw the Light) to adventure on the
Water, which was high by reason of a
Flood: She walked up and down along
the River-Bank, even where, and even as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54241:77"/>
the aforesaid Candle did, waiting for the
falling of the Water; which at last she
took, but too soon for her, for she was
Drowned therein. Of late my Sexton's
Wife, an Aged understanding Woman,
saw from her Bed, a little bluish Candle
on her Tables-end, within 2, or 3, Days
after came a Fellow enquiring for her
Husband, and taking something from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Cloak clap'd it down upon the
Tables-end; it was a Dead-born Child.</p>
                     <p>Another time, the same Woman saw
such another Candle upon the end of the
self-same Table; within a few Days after
a weak Child newly Christned by me,
was brought to the Sexton's House,
where presently he died: And when the
Sexton's Wife, who was then abroad came
home, she found the Child, on the other
end of the Table, where she had seen the
Candle.</p>
                     <p>Some 30, or 40 Years since, my Wife's
Sister, being Nurse to Baronet <hi>Rudds</hi>
three Eldest Children, and (the Lady
Mistress being Dead) the Lady Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller
of the House going late into the
Chamber where the Maid-servants lay,
saw no less than Five of those Lights toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It happened a while after, that the
Chamber being newly Plaister'd, and a
Grate of Coal-fire therein kindled to hasten
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54241:78"/>
the drying of the Plaister, that five of the
Maid servants went to Bed as they were
wont (but as it fell out) too soon; for
in the Morning they were all Dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Suffocated in their Sleep with the
steem of the new-tempered Lime and
Coal. </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1670. A poor Widow's Daughter
in <hi>Herefordshire</hi> went to Service not far
from <hi>Harwood</hi> [the Seat of Sir <hi>Iohn Hoskins</hi>
Baronet R. S. S] She was aged neer about
twenty; fell very ill, even to the point of
Death, her Mother was old and Feeble,
and her Daughter was the Comfort of her
life; if she should die, she knew not what
to do: She besought God upon her Knees
in Prayer, that he would be pleased to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54241:79"/>
spare her Daughters life, and take her to
him: At this very time, the Daughter fell
into a Trance, which continued about an
Hour; they thought she had been Dead:
When she recovered out of it, she declared
the Vision she had in this Fit, <hi>viz.</hi> That
one in black Habit came to her, whose Face
was so bright and glorious she could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it; and also he had such brightness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Breast, and (if I forget not) upon
his Arms: And told her, that her Mother's
Prayers were heard, and that her Mother
should shortly dye, and she should sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recover: And she did so, and her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dyed. She hath the character of a
modest, humble, vertuous Maid. Had this
been in some Catholick Country, it would
have made a great noise.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain, there was one in the <hi>Strand,</hi>
who lay in a Trance a few Hours before he
departed: And in his Trance had a Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the II.
It was at the very Day of his Apoplectick
Fit.</p>
               <p>There is a Sheet of Paper Printed 16 ...
concerning Extasies, that <hi>Iames Vsher,</hi> late
Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> once had: But I
have been assur'd from my Honour'd Friend
<hi>Iames Tyrrel</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> (his Lordship's Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
that, this was not an Extasie; but
that his Lordship upon Reading the 12, 13,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54241:80"/>
14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chapters of the Revelation, and
farther reflecting upon the great increase of
the Sectaries in <hi>England,</hi> supposed that
they would let in Popery, which Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
put him into a great Transport at
the time when his Daughter (the Lady
<hi>Tyrrel)</hi> came into the Room; when he
Discoursed to her divers things (tho not all)
contained in the said Printed Paper.</p>

It is strange, that as one walks the Streets
sometimes one shall meet with an Aspect,
(of Male or Female) that pleases our Souls;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54241:80"/>
and whose Natural sweetness of Nature,
we could boldly rely upon. One never
saw the other before, and so could neither
oblige, or disoblige each other. <hi>Gaze not
on a Maid, saith</hi> Ecclus. 9. 5.</p>
               <p>The Glances of Envy and Malice, do
shoot also subtilly; the Eye of the Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Person does really Infect (and make
Sick) the Spirit of the other. The Lord
<hi>Bacon</hi> saith, it hath been observed, That
after Triumphs, the Triumphants have
been sick in Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Chymist can draw subtile Spirits,
that will work upon one another at some
distance, <hi>viz.</hi> Spirits of Alkalies and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
<hi>e. g.</hi> Spirits Coelestial (Sal Armoniac
and Spirit C. C. will work on each other

the Spirits above mentioned are more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
than they.</p>
               <q>Non amo te Sabati, nec possum dicere

               <p>But if an Astrologer had their Nativities,
he would find a great disagreement in the
Schemes. These are Hyperphysical Opticks,
and drawn from the Heavens.</p>
               <p>Infants are very sensible of these Irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

                     <p>FOR your Satisfaction I drew up
some Queries about the Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted
Men, and having sent them
to the Northern parts of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
some while ago I recieved Answers
to them from two different Hands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I am now to give you an Account,

                     </p>
                     <p> If some few credible well-attested Instances
of such a Knowledge as is commonly called the
Second-sight, can be given?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many Instances of such Knowledge can
be given, by the Confession of such who are
skilled in that Faculty: For instances, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
you the Fourth Query.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Query. 2.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it consists in the discovery of present, or
past Events only? Or, if it extend to such as
are to come?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second-sight relates only to things
future, which will shortly come to pass.
Past Events I learn nothing of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Query. 3.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Objects of this Knowledge, be sad and
dismal Events only; such as Deaths and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?
Or, joyful and prosperous also?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sad and dismal Events, are the Objects
of this Knowledge: As sudden Deaths,
dismal Accidents: That they are Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54241:83"/>
or Joyful, I cannot learn. Only
one instance I have from a Person worthy of
Credit, and thereby judge of the Joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Prosperity of it, and it is this. Near
40 Years ago <hi>Macklend</hi> and his Lady, Sister
to my Lord <hi>Seaforth,</hi> were Walking about
their own House, and in their return, both
came into the Nurses Chamber, where
their young Child was on the Breast: At
their coming into the Room, the Nurse
falls a Weeping; they asked the cause,
dreading the Child was Sick, or that she
was scarce of Milk: The Nurse replied,
the Child was well, and she had abundance
of Milk; yet she still Wept; and being
pressed to tell what ailed her; she at last
said, <hi>Macklend</hi> would dye, and the Lady
would shortly be Marryed to another Man.
Being enquired how she knew that Event,
she told them plainly, that as they came
both into the Room, she saw, a Man with
a scarlet Cloak and a white Hat, betwixt
them, giving the Lady a Kiss over the
Shoulder; and this was the cause of her
Weeping. All which came to pass after
<hi>Macklend</hi>'s Death: the Tutor of <hi>Lovat</hi>
Marry'd the Lady in the same Habit the
Woman saw him. Now by this instance,
judge if it be Prosperous to one, it is as Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
to another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <pb n="154" facs="tcp:54241:84"/>Query. 4.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If these Events, which Second-sighted Men
discover, or fore-tell, be visibly represented to
them, and acted, as it were, before their
Eyes?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Affirmatively, they see those things vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly;
but none sees but themselves; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
if a Man's Fatal-end be Hanging;
they'll see a Gibbet, or a Rope about his
Neck: if Beheaded, they'll see the Man
without a Head; if Drowned, they'll see
Water up to his Throat; if unexpected
Death, they'll see a Winding-sheet about
his Head: All which are represented to
their View. One Instance I had from a
Gentleman here, of a <hi>Highland</hi> Gentleman
of the <hi>Mackdonalds,</hi> who having a Brother
that came to visit him, saw him coming in
wanting a Head; yet told not his Brother,
he saw any such thing; but within 24
Hours thereafter, his Brother was taken,
(being a Murderer) and his Head cut off,
and sent to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> Many such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
might be given.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Query. 5.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Second-sight be a thing that is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
and uneasie to those that have it? and
such as they would gladly be rid of?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <pb n="155" facs="tcp:54241:84"/>Answer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It's commonly talk'd-by all I spoke with,
That it is troublesome; and they would
gladly be freed from it, but cannot: Only
I heard lately of a Man very much troubled
in his Soul therewith, and by serious beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of God Deliverance from it, at length
lost the Faculty of the Second-sight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Query. 6.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any Person, or Persons, truly Godly, who
may justly be presumed to be such, have been
known to have had this Gift or Faculty?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Negatively, not any Godly, but such as
are Vitious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Query. 7.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it descends by succession from Parents to
Children? Or, if not, Whether those that
have it, can tell how they came by it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That it is by Succession, I cannot learn;
how they came by it, is hard to know, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will they tell; which if they did, they
are sure of their stroaks from an invisible
Hand. One Instance I heard of one <hi>Allen
Miller,</hi> being in company with some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54241:85"/>
having gotten a little more than
ordinary of that strong Liquor they were
Drinking, began to tell Stories and strange
passages he had been at: But the said <hi>Allen</hi>
was suddenly removed to the farther end of
the House, and was there almost strangled;
recovering a little and coming to the place
where he was before, they asked him,
What it was that troubled him so? He
answered, he durst not tell; for he had told
too much already.</p>
                     <p>How came they by it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some say by Compact with the Devil;
some say by Converse with those Daemons
we call Fairies. I have heard, that those
that have this Faculty of the Second-sight,

Curious to know it; upon such and such

                     <p>This is all I could learn by Tradition of
that Faculty, from Knowing and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Men. If this satisfie not these Queries
aforesaid, acquaint me, and what can be
known of it, shall be Transmitted.</p>
                     <p>I cannot pass by an Instance I have from
a very honest Man in the next Parish, who
told me it himself. That his Wife being
big with Child near her Delivery, he buys
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54241:85"/>
half a Dozen of Boards to make her a Bed
against the time she lay in. The Boards
lying at the Door of his House, there comes
an old Fisher-woman, yet alive, and asked
him, Whose were those Boards? He told
her they were his own; she asked again,
For what use he had them? He replied, for
a Bed; she again said, intend them for what
use you please, she saw a dead Corps ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on them, and that they would be a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin:
Which struck the honest Man to
the Heart, fearing the Death of his Wife.
But when the old Woman went off, he
calls presently for a Carpenter to make the
Bed, which was accordingly done; but
shortly after the honest Man had a Child
died, whose Coffin was made of the ends
of those Boards.</p>
                     <p>Sir, The Original, whereof this that I
have Writ, is a true Copy, was sent by a
Minister, living within some few Miles of
<hi>Inverness,</hi> to a Friend of mine whom I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to get Information for me; as I insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
before: I have other Answers to
these Queries from another Hand, which I
purposed to have communicated to you at
this time; but I find there will not be room
enough for them in this Sheet; howbeit, in
case you think it fit, they shall be sent you
afterward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:54241:86"/>In the mean time, I shall tell you what I
have had from one of the Masters of our
College here (a <hi>North</hi> Country-man both
by Birth and Education, in his younger
Years) who made a Journey in the Harvest
time into the Shire of <hi>Ross,</hi> and at my
desire, made some enquiry there, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Second-sight. He reports, That
there they told him many Instances of this
Knowledge, which he had forgotten, except
two. The first, one of his Sisters, a young
Gentlewoman, staying with a Friend at
some 30 Miles distance from her Father's
House, and the ordinary place of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence;
One who had the Second-sight in
the Family where she was, saw a young
Man attending her as she went up and down
the House, and this was about Three
Months before her Marriage. The second
is of a Woman in that Country who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to have the Second-sight, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that Eight Days before the Death of a
Gentleman there, she saw a Bier or Coffin
covered with a Cloth which she knew, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
as it were to the place of Burial, and
attended with a great Company, one of
which told her it was the Corps of such a
Person, naming that Gentleman, who died
Eight Days after. By these Instances it
appears, that the Objects of this Knowledge
are not sad and dismal Events only, but
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54241:86"/>
joyful and prosperous ones also: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
farther, that he was inform'd there,
if I mistake not, by some of those who had
the Second sight, That if at any time when
they set those strange Sights, they set
their Foot upon the Foot of another who
hath not the Second-sight, that other will
for that time see what they are seeing; as
also that they offered, if he pleased, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the Second-sight to him. I have
nothing more to add at present, but that

concerning Second-sighted Men, sent by
a Minister living near Inverness, to a
Friend of mine.</head>

                     <head>Query. 1.</head>
                     <p>That there is such an Art, commonly
called the Second-sight, is certain, from these
following Instances,</p>
                     <p>First, in a Gentleman's House, one
Night the Mistress considering why such
Persons whom she expected, were so late,
and so long a coming, the Supper being
all the while delayed for them; a Servant
Man about the House (finding the Mistress
anxious) having the Second-sight, desires
to cover the Table, and before all things
were put on, those Persons she longed for
would come in: Which happened ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                     <p>A Second Instance, concerning a young
Lady of great Birth, whom a Rich Knight
fancied and came in sute of the Lady, but
she could not endure to fancy him, being a
harsh and unpleasant Man: But her
Friends importuning her dayly, she turned
melancholy and lean, Fasting and Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54241:88"/>
continually. A common Fellow about
the House meeting her one Day in the Fields,
asked her, saying, Mrs. <hi>Kate,</hi> What is that
that troubles you and makes you look so ill?
She replied, that the cause is known to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
for my Friends would have me Marry
such a Man by name, but I cannot fancy
him. Nay, (says the Fellow) give over
these Niceties, for he will be your first Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and will not Live long, and be sure
he will leave you a rich Dowry, which will
procure you a great Match, for I see a Lord
upon each Shoulder of you: All which
came to pass in every Circumstance; as
Eye and Ear Witnesses declare.</p>
                     <p>A Third Instance, of a Traveller coming
in to a certain House, desired some Meat:
The Mistress being something nice and
backward to give him Victuals; you need
not, says he, churle me in a piece of Meat;
for before an Hour and an half be over, a
young Man of such a stature and garb will
come in with a great Salmon-fish on his
Back, which I behold yonder on the Floor:
And it came to pass within the said time.</p>
                     <p>A Fourth Instance, of a young Woman
in a certain House about Supper time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to take Meat from the Steward who
was offering in the very time Meat to her;
being asked why she would not take it?
replied, she saw him full of Blood, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54241:88"/>
therefore was afraid to take any thing of
his Hands. The next Morning, the said
Steward offering to compose a difference
between two Men, at an Ale-house Door got
a stroke of a Sword on the Forehead, and
came home full of Blood. This was told
me by an Eye Witness.</p>

                     <p>Those that have this Faculty of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-sight,
see only things to come, which
are to happen shortly thereafter, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fore-tell things which fall out Three
or four Years after. For instance, one told
his Master, that he saw an Arrow in such
a Man through his Body, and yet no Blood
came out: His Master told him, that it was
impossible an Arrow should stick in a Man's
Body and no Blood come out, and if that
come not to pass he would be deemed an
Impostor. But about 5 or 6 Years after
the Man died, and being brought to his
Burial-place, there arose a Debate anent his
Grave, and it came to such a height, that
they drew Arms and bended their Bows,
and one letting off an Arrow, shot through
the dead Body upon the Bier-trees, and so no
Blood could issue out at a dead Man's
Wound. Thus his Sight could not inform
him whether the Arrow should be shot in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54241:89"/>
him Alive or Dead, neither could he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
whether near or afar off.</p>

                     <p>They foresee Murthers, Drownings,
Weddings, Burials, Combates, Manslaught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
of all which many Instances might
be given. Lately (I believe in <hi>August</hi> last
1695.) one told there would be Drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the River <hi>Bewly,</hi> which came to pass:
Two pretty Men crossing a Ford both
Drowned, which fell out within a Month.
Another Instance, a Man that served the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Catnes,</hi> who had 5 Daughters in his
House, one of them grudged, that the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of the Family lay on her wholly: The

in black walking on the Bishop's
Right-hand whom she should Marry: And
this fell out accordingly within a quarter of

sense of God and Religion, and may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed

appointed publick Prayers to be

Church by their Minister, and they have
compeired before the Pulpit, after Sermon

making Confession openly of that Sin with
deep sense on their Knees; renounced any
such Gift or Faculty which they had to God's

                        <p>I Am more willing than able to satisfie
your desire: As for instances of such a
Knowledge, I could furnish many. I shall
only insert some few attested by several
of good Credit yet alive.</p>
                        <p>And First, <hi>Andrew Mackpherson</hi> of <hi>Clunie</hi>
in <hi>Badenoch,</hi> being in sute of the Laird of
<hi>Gareloch</hi>'s Daughter, as he was upon a day
going to <hi>Gareloch,</hi> the Lady <hi>Gareloch</hi> was
going somewhere from her House within
kenning to the Road which <hi>Clunie</hi> was
coming; the Lady perceiving him, said to
her Attendants, that yonder was <hi>Clunie,</hi>
going to see his Mistress: One that had
this Second-sight in her company replied
and said, if yon be he, unless he Marry
within six Months, he'll never Mary. The
Lady asked, how did he know that? He
said, very well; for I see him, saith he,
all inclosed in his Winding-sheet, except
his Nostrils and his Mouth, which will
also close up within Six Months; which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54241:91"/>
happened even as he foretold; within the
said space he died, and his Brother <hi>Duncan
Mackpherson</hi> this present <hi>Clunie</hi> succeeded.
This and the like may satisfie your fourth
Query, he seeing the Man even then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
all over with his dead Linens. The
Event was visibly represented and as it
were acted (before his Eyes) and also the
last part of your second Query, <hi>viz.</hi> That
it was as yet to come. As for the rest of
the Questions, <hi>viz.</hi> That they discover pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and past Events, is also manifest, thus:
I have heard of a Gentleman whose Son had
gon abroad, and being anxious to know
how he was, he went to Consult one who
had this Faculty, who told him, that that
same Day 5 a Clock in the Afternoon his
Son had Married a Woman in <hi>France,</hi> with
whom he had got so many Thousand
Crowns, and within two Years he should
come home to see Father and Friends, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Wife with Child of a Daughter, and
a Son of six Months Age behind him:
Which accordingly was true. About the
same time two Years he came home, and
verified all that was fore-told.</p>
                        <p>It is likewise ordinary with Persons that
lose any thing, to go to some of these Men,
by whom they are directed; how, what
Persons, and in what place they shall find
it. But all such as profess that Skill,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54241:91"/>
are not equally dexterous in it. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
two of them were in Mr. <hi>Hector
Mackenzi</hi> Minister of <hi>Inverness</hi> his Father's
House; the one a Gentleman, the other a
common Fellow; and Discoursing by the
Fire-side, the Fellow suddenly begins to
Weep, and cry out Alas! alas! such a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is either Dead or presently expiring.
The Gentlewoman lived 5 or 6 Miles from
the House, and had been some Days before
in a Fever. The Gentleman being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
better expert in that Faculty, said,
No, saith he, she's not Dead; nor will
she dye of this Disease. O saith the Fellow,
do you not see her all covered with her
Winding-sheet? Ay, saith the Gentleman, I
see her as well as you do; but do you not
see her Linnen all wet? which is her Sweat,
she being presently, cooling of the Fever.
This Story Mr. <hi>Hector</hi> himself will testifie.
The most Remarkable of this sort, that I
hear of now, is one <hi>Archibald Mackeanyers,</hi>
alias <hi>Mackdonald,</hi> Living in <hi>Ardinmurch</hi>
within 10 or 20 Miles, or thereby, of <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coe,</hi>
and I was present my self, where he
fore-told something, which accordingly
fell-out. In 1683. this Man being in
<hi>Strathspey</hi> in <hi>Iohn Mackdonald</hi> of <hi>Glencoe</hi> his
Company, told, in <hi>Balachastell</hi> before the
Laird of <hi>Grant,</hi> his Lady, and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and also in my Father's House; that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54241:92"/>
                           <hi>Argyle,</hi> of whom few or none knew then
where he was, at least there was no word of
him then here; should within two Twelve
Months thereafter, come to the <hi>West-High-lands,</hi>
and raise a Rebellious Faction, which
would be divided among themselves, and
disperse, and he unfortunately be taken and
Beheaded at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and his Head set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Talbooth,</hi> where his Father's Head
was before him: Which proved as true, as
he fore-told it, in 1685. thereafter. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> next after the
late Revolution, as my Lord <hi>Dundee</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
up <hi>Spey-side</hi> after he had followed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Major <hi>Mac Kay</hi> in his Reer down the
length of <hi>Edinglassie,</hi> at the <hi>Milatown</hi> of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinbeg</hi>
the <hi>Machleans</hi> joined him, and after
he had received them, he Marched forward,
but they remained behind, and fell a Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering:
Upon which, <hi>Glencoe</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
among whom was this <hi>Archibald,</hi> being
in my Father's House and hearing that <hi>Mac
Leans</hi> and others were Pillaging some of his
Lands, went to restrain them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to March after the Army;
after he had cleared the first Town, next
my Father's House of them, and was come
to the second, there standing on a Hill,
this <hi>Archibald</hi> said, <hi>Glencoe,</hi> If you take
my Advice, then make off with your self
with all possible haste, for ere an Hour
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54241:92"/>
come and go, you'll be put to it as hard
as ever you was: Some of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
began to droll and say, what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of me? Whether <hi>Glencoe</hi> believed him,
or no, I cannot tell; but this I am sure of,
that whereas before he was of intention to
return to my Father's House and stay all
Night, now we took leave and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
parted: And indeed, within an Hour
thereafter <hi>Mac Kay,</hi> and his whole Forces
appeared at <hi>Culnakyle</hi> in <hi>Abernethie</hi> 2 Miles
below the place where we parted, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Cleaverhouse</hi> had Marched up the
Water-side a little before, but that <hi>Mac
Leans</hi> and several other stranglers had stayed
behind, commanded Major <hi>Aeneas Mac Kay,</hi>
with 2 Troops of Horse after them; who
finding the said <hi>Mac Leans</hi> at <hi>Kinchardie</hi> in
the Parish of <hi>Duthel,</hi> Chased them up the
<hi>Morskaith:</hi> In which Chase <hi>Glencoe</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to be, and was hard put to it, as was
fore-told. What became of <hi>Archibald</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
I am not sure, I have not seen him
since, nor can I get a true Account of him,
only I know he is yet alive, and at that
time one of my Father's Men whom the
Red-coats meeting, compell'd to guide them,
within sight of the <hi>Mac Leans,</hi> found the
said <hi>Archibald</hi>'s Horse within a Mile of the
place where I left him. I am also inform'd,
this <hi>Archibald</hi> said to <hi>Glencoe,</hi> that he would
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54241:93"/>
be Murthered in the Night-time in his own
House Three Months before it happen'd.</p>
                        <p>Touching your 3d. Query, The Objects
of this Knowledge, are not only sad and
dismal; but also joyful and prosperous:
Thus, they fore-tell of happy Marriages,
good Children, what kind of Life Men shall
Live, and in what Condition they shall
Die: Also Riches, Honour, Preferment,
Peace, Plenty and good Weather.</p>
                        <p>Query. 6. What way they pretend to
have it? I am informed, that in the Isle
of <hi>Sky,</hi> especially before the Gospel came
thither; several Families had it by Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
descending from Parents to Children,
and as yet there be many there that have it
that way; and the only way to be freed
from it is; when a Woman hath it her self
and is Married to a Man that hath it also;
if in the very Act of Delivery, upon the
first sight of the Childs Head, it be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
the same is free from it; if not he hath
it all his Life: By which it seems, it is a
thing troublesome and uneasie to them that
have it, and such as they would fain be rid
of. And may satisfie your 5th Query. And
for your farther contentment in this Query;
I heard of my Father, that there was one
<hi>Iohn du beg Mac Grigor</hi> a <hi>Reanach</hi>-man Born,
very expert in this Knowledge, and my
Father coming one Day from <hi>Inverness,</hi>
                           <pb n="173" facs="tcp:54241:93"/>
said by the way, that he would go into an
Alehouse on the Road, which then would
be about 5 Miles off. This <hi>Iohn Mac Grigor</hi>
being in his Company, and taking up a Slate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
at his Foot, and looking to it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied;
Nay, saith he, you will not go in
there, for there is but a matter of a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
of Ale in it even now, and ere we
come to it, it will be all near Drunken,
and those who are Drinking there, are
Strangers to us, and ere we be hardly past
the House, they'll discord among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
Which fell out so; ere we were
two pair of Butts past the House, those
that were Drinking there went by the
Ears, wounded and mischieved one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
My Father by this and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of this nature, turned curious
of this Faculty, and being very intimate
with the Man, told him he would fain learn
it: To which he answered, that indeed
he could in 3 Days time Teach him if he
pleased; but yet he would not advise
him nor any Man to learn it; for had he
once learned he would never be a Minute
in his Life, but he would see innumerable
Men and Women Night and Day round
about him; which perhaps he would think
wearisome and unpleasant, for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
my Father would not have it. But as
Skilful as this Man was, yet he knew not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54241:94"/>
what should be his own last End; which
was Hanging: And I am Informed, that
most, if not all of them, though they can
fore-see what shall happen to others; yet
they cannot fore-tell, much less prevent
what shall besal themselves. I am also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by one who came last Summer from
the Isle of <hi>Sky,</hi> that any Person that pleases
will get it Taught him for a Pound or two
of Tobacco.</p>
                        <p>As for your last Query. For my own
part, I can hardly believe they can be justly
presumed, much less truly Godly. As for
this <hi>Mac Grigor</hi> several report, that he was
a very civil discreet Man, and some say he
was of good Deportment, and also unjustly
Hanged. But <hi>Archibald Mackenyere</hi> will
not deny himself, but once he was one
of the most Notorious Thieves in all the
<hi>Highlands:</hi> But I am informed since I came
to this Knowledge which was by an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
too long here to relate, that he is
turned honester than before.</p>
                        <p>There was one <hi>Iames Mack Coil-vic-alaster</hi>
alias <hi>Grant,</hi> in <hi>Glenbeum</hi> near <hi>Kirk-Michael</hi>
in <hi>Strathawin,</hi> who had this Sight, who I
hear of several that were well acquainted
with, was a very honest Man, and of right
blameless Conversation. He used ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by looking to the Fire, to fore-tell what
Strangers would come to his House the next
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54241:94"/>
Day, or shortly thereafter, by their Habit
and Arms, and sometimes also by their
Names; and if any of his Goods or Cattel
were missing, he would direct his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to the very place where to find them
whether in a Mire or upon dry Ground; he
would also tell, if the Beast were already
Dead, or if it would Die ere they could
come to it; and in Winter if they were
thick about the Fire-side, he would desire
them to make room to some others that
stood by, tho they did not see them, else
some of them would be quickly thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the midst of it. But whether this Man
saw any more than <hi>Brownie</hi> and <hi>Meig Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach,</hi>
I am not very sure: Some say, he saw
more continually, and would often be very
angry-like, and something troubled, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
visibly moving him: Others affirm
he saw these two continually, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
many more.</p>
                        <p>They generally term this Second-sight
in <hi>Irish Tashitaraughk,</hi> and such as have
it <hi>Taishatrin,</hi> from <hi>Taish,</hi> which is properly
a shadowy substance, or such naughty,
and thing, as can only, or rather
scarcely be discerned by the Eye; but not
caught by the hands: for which they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
it to <hi>Bugles</hi> or Ghosts, so that <hi>Taish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
is as much as one that converses with
Ghosts or Spirits, or as they commonly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54241:95"/>
call them, the <hi>Fairies,</hi> or <hi>Fairy-Folks.</hi>
Others call these Men <hi>Phissichin,</hi> from <hi>Phis,</hi>
which is properly Fore-sight, or Fore-knowledge.
This is the surest and clearest
account of Second-sighted Men that I can
now find, and I have set it down fully,
as if I were transiently telling it, in your
own presence, being curious for nothing
but the verity, so far as I could. What
you find improper or superfluous, you
can best compendise it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>Thus far this Letter, written in a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
and Homely stile, which I have here
set down at length: <hi>Meg Mullack,</hi> and
<hi>Brownie</hi> mentioned in the end of it, are
two Ghosts, which (as is constantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported)
of old haunted a Family in
<hi>Straths-pey</hi> of the Name of <hi>Grant.</hi> They
appeared, the first in the likeness of a
young Lass: The Second of a young Lad.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <hi>Moulin</hi> (who presents his service to
you) hath no aquaintance in <hi>Orkney;</hi> but
I have just now spoken with one who not
only hath acquaintance in that Country,
but also entertains some thoughts of going
thither himself, to get me an account of
the Cures usually practised there. The
<hi>Cortex Winteranus</hi> mentioned by you as
an excellent Medicine, I have heard com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
as good for the <hi>Scurvy;</hi> if you
know it to be Eminent or Specifick
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54241:95"/>
(such as the Peruvian Bark is) for any
Disease. I shall be well pleased to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by you.</p>
                        <p>Thus, Sir, you have an account of all
my Informations concerning Second-sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men: I have also briefly touched all
the other particulars in both your Letters,
which needed a Reply, except your Thanks
so liberally and obligingly returned to me
for my Letters, and the kind sense you
express of that small service. The kind
reception which you have given to those
poor trifles, and the value which you put
on them, I consider as effects of your
kindness to my self, and as engagements
on me to serve you to better purpose when
it shall be in the power of</p>

                     <hi>DIembroke</hi> in his Book <hi>de Peste,</hi> gives
us a story of <hi>Dimmerus de Raet,</hi>
that being at <hi>Delft,</hi> where the Plague
then raged, sent then his Wife Thirty
Miles off. And when the Doctor went to
see the Gentleman of the House, as soon as
he came in, the old Chair-woman that
washed the Cloathes fell a weeping: He
asked her, Why? said she, My Mistress
is now dead: I saw her Apparition but
just now without a Head, and that it
was usual with her when a Friend of hers
died, to see their Apparitions in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
though never so far off. His Wife
died at that time.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Th. May</hi> in his History <hi>Lib.</hi> VIII.
writes, that an Old Man (like an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit)
<hi>Second-sighted,</hi> took his leave of King
<hi>Iames</hi> the First, when he came into
<hi>England:</hi> He took little notice of Prince
<hi>Henry,</hi> but addressing himself to the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> [since King <hi>Charles</hi> I.]
fell a weeping to think what misfortunes
he should undergo; and that he should be
one of the miserablest unhappy Princes that
ever was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:54241:96"/>A <hi>Scotch</hi> Noble Man sent for one of
these Second-sighted Men out of the <hi>High-lands</hi>
to give his Judgment of the then
great Favourite <hi>George Villiers,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Buckingham;</hi> as soon as ever he saw him,
<hi>Pish,</hi> said he, <hi>he will come to nothing. I
