            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>O Raree-Show, O Pretty-Show: OR, THE CITY FEAST.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>ON a Day of great Triumph, when Lord of the City,</l>
               <l>Does Swear to be Honest and Just, as he's Witty;</l>
               <l>And Rides thro' the Town, that the Rable may Shout-him,</l>
               <l>For the wonderful Merits he carries about-him;</l>
               <l>B'ing an Honester Man I'll be bold for to say,</l>
               <l>Than has sat in the Chair this many a day.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Like the rest of the Fools, from the Skirts of the Town,</l>
               <l>I Trotted to Gaze at his Chain and his Gown.</l>
               <l>With legs in a Kennel, quite up to the middle</l>
               <l>In dirt, with a Stomach as sharp as a Needle,</l>
               <l>I stood in the Cold, clinging fast to a Stump,</l>
               <l>To see the Wisakers march by in their Pomp.</l>
               <l>At last heard a Consort of Trumpets and Drums,</l>
               <l>And the <hi>Mob</hi> crying out, <hi>Here he comes, here he comes.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I was carr'd by the Crowd, from the place that I stood-in,</l>
               <l>And the Devil to do <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was all of a suddain.</l>
               <l>The first that appeard was a grear Tom-a-doodle,</l>
               <l>With a Cap like a Bushel, to cover his Noddle,</l>
               <l>And a Gown that hung dragling thro' every Puddle;</l>
               <l>With a Sword and a Mace, and such Pagentry Pride,</l>
               <l>And aboundance of Formal old Fopry beside.</l>
               <l>A Troop of grave Elders, O then there came by,</l>
               <l>In their Blood-Coloured Robes, of a very deep die,</l>
               <l>On Jennets the best that the Town cou'd afford,</l>
               <l>As Tame all as Lambs, and as Fine as my Lord,</l>
               <l>With very rich Saddles, gay Bridles and Cruppers,</l>
               <l>Would ne'er have been made but for such City Troopers.</l>
               <l>Like Snails o'er a Cabbage, they all crept along,</l>
               <l>Admir'd by their Wives, and Huzza'd by the Throng.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Companys follow'd, each Man in his Station,</l>
               <l>Which ev'ry Fool knows is not worth Observation;</l>
               <l>All cloathed in Furrs, in an Ancient Decorum,</l>
               <l>Like Bears they advanc'd, with their Bag-pipes before-'em;</l>
               <l>With Streamers and Drums; and abundance of Fooling,</l>
               <l>Not worth the Repeating, or yet Rediculing:</l>
               <l>So I'll bid adieu to the Tun-belly'd Sinners,</l>
               <l>And leave them to Trudg thro' the Dirt to their Dinners.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At last I consider'd 'twas very foul play,</l>
               <l>That a Poet should Fast on a Festival Day;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:109715:2"/>
I therefore resolv'd it should cost me a fall,</l>
               <l>But that I would Drink my Lords Health at a Hall:</l>
               <l>For why mayn't a Poet (thought I) be a Guest,</l>
               <l>As wellcome as Parson, or Fool at a Feast,</l>
               <l>For the sport of a Tale or the sake of a Jest.</l>
               <l>I mix'd with the Musick, and no one withstood-me,</l>
               <l>And so Jostl'd forward as cleaver as cou'd be.</l>
               <l>I pass'd to a very fine Room, thro'a Porch</l>
               <l>'Twas as a wide as a Barn, and as high a Church;</l>
               <l>Where Cloths upon Shovel-board-Tables were Spread,</l>
               <l>And all things in order for Dinner were laid;</l>
               <l>The Napkins where folded on every Plate,</l>
               <l>Into Castles and Boates, and the Devil knows what.</l>
               <l>Their Flaggons and Bowls made a very fine show,</l>
               <l>And Sweat-meates, like Cuckolds, stood all in a row.</l>
               <l>They walk'd and they talk'd; after some Consultation</l>
               <l>The <hi>Beadle</hi> stood up, and he made Proclamation,</l>
               <l>That no one presume, of a Member, till after</l>
               <l>He's din'd, to bring in his Wife or his Daughter.</l>
               <l>Then in comes the Pasties, the best of all Food,</l>
               <l>With Pig, Goose, and Capon, and all that was good.</l>
               <l>Then Grace soon was said, without any delay,</l>
               <l>And as Hungry as Hawks they sat down to their Prey.</l>
               <l>The Musick Struck up such a <hi>Bory</hi> advancing,</l>
               <l>As the <hi>Polanders</hi> Pip'd, when their <hi>Cubs</hi> were a Dancing.</l>
               <l>Then each tuck'd his Napkin up under his Chin,</l>
               <l>That his Holy-Day Band might be kept very clean;</l>
               <l>And pin'd up his Sleeves to his Elbows, because</l>
               <l>They should not hang down, and be greas'd in the Sauce.</l>
               <l>Then all went to work, with such Rending and Tearing,</l>
               <l>Like a Kennel of Hounds on a Quarter of Carri'n.</l>
               <l>When done with the Flesh, then they Claw'd of the Fish,</l>
               <l>With one hand at Mouth, and the other in th' Dish.</l>
               <l>When their Stomacks were Cloi'd, what their Bellies denied,</l>
               <l>Each clap'd in his Pocket to give to his <hi>Bride;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>With a Cheese-cake and Custard for my little <hi>Johnny,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And a handful of Sweet-meats for poor Daughter <hi>Nanny.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then down came a Blade, with a Rattle in's Skull,</l>
               <l>To tickle their Eares, when their Bellies were full;</l>
               <l>After three or four Hems, to clear up his Voice,</l>
               <l>At ev'ry Table he made them a Noise,</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Twenty Four Fiddlers were all in a Row,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Tho' the Singer meant <hi>Cuckolds,</hi> I'd have them to know,</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Londons a Gallant Town, and a fine City,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>'Tis Govern'd by Scarlet, the more is the Pitty.</hi>

               <l>When Claret and Sack had trould freely about,</l>
               <l>And each Man was Laden, within and without,</l>
               <l>The Elders arising, all Stagger'd away,</l>
               <l>And in Sleeping like Hogs, spent the rest of the day.</l>
