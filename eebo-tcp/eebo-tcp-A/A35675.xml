            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ROBERT,
Earl of Sunderland,

            </opener>
            <p>GRatitude, as well as Justice, requires,
that a Poet should address his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to him, who procures the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of his Art; And 'tis sufficiently
known, that 'tis in a great measure to the
wisdom of your Lordship's Counsels, that we
owe the near prospect of a glorious Peace,
which alone can make Poetry flourish: A pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
without which we Writers, should be as
men in the world without hope; hope which
is the present happiness of the wretched, and
their earnest of future felicity.</p>
            <p>My Lord, the indefatigable pains, and the
<pb facs="tcp:40409:3"/>
unwearied diligence which your Lordship has
us'd in the advancing that Peace, and your
entring at this happy Conjuncture, upon that
high office, which brings those who write
for the Stage, immediately under your ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
give us assurances of what we
may expect from your Lordship<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>

Empire to <hi>Augustus,</hi> that he begun to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
those mighty geniuses, which were
equal to the Majesty of the <hi>Roman</hi> people.</p>
            <p>My Lord, when we, who write for the
Stage, cast our Eyes around us, we conclude
unanimously, that if we our selves were to
chuse our protector, we should be proud to
make the same choice which the King has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made for us. Tho at the same time I
humbly beg leave to acquaint your Lordship,
that neither your Birth, nor Rank, nor your
Capacity for affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho this is great, as those
are illustrious, cou'd determin us to that choice.
No, my Lord, you have qualities which weigh
more with us, than all those glorious advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
and those are, the fineness of your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ernment,
in matters of Wit and Eloquence,
<pb facs="tcp:40409:3"/>
and the delicacy of your taste; qualities by
which we hope to get the better of the Enemies
of the Commonwealth of Learning, which are
cold ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifiers and false Criticks, as by the
wisdom of your Lordships Counsels, we have
humbled the Enemies of the State.</p>
            <p>The foremention'd qualities, which are so
conspicuous in your Lordship, are such alone
as can capacitate a great man to protect
good Writers, and which alone can gain him
their homage. For that which animates them
in their undertakings is, chiefly the thirst of
Glory, and they desire to be distinguished as
well as supported; and therefore are proud
when they can at any time address themselves
to a Judge, who never yet conferr'd his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
upon one who was undeserving of
them, and the reputation of whose Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
applause, may serve at once to confirm
their Friends, and to convert their Enemies.</p>
            <p>That I have at least the Ambition of such
Writers, no man can doubt, who sees me Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
my self,</p>

            <head>Advertisement to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THE following Play was at first design'd a F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rce:
But when I consider'd that the design of it, was both
just and important, as well as it is entirely new, I alter'd
my intention, and resolv'd to make it low Comedy, which
it now is, and perhaps the most regular of all our Low Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.
The Action is one and intire, the incidents parts
of that Action, and naturally or probably produce one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and the very last is the genuine result of the first.
The Scenes are connected and dependant, each of them upon
the following and the preceding, so that if you retren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>b or
transpose but one of them, you destroy, or maim, or confound
the Action; and they all of them gradually advance that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and bring on the Catastrophe. At the same time I have
endeavour'd to reconcile variety to unity, and to make
the business of every act different from the preceding.
The Characters are all of them absolutely necessary, and if
you take away any one of them, there can be no Action
and no Comedy. The unity of Time is exactly observ'd.
For the time of the Action is precisely the same with that
of the representation. That of place is not kept so strictly:
For upon the account of Novelty, I laid the Scene of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Act in the Play-house, and the effect has been so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
that I can hardly repent it. Yet, even in relation to
unity of place, this is one of the most regular of our Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
But regularity in a Comedy, signifies little without
Diversion. The Reader himself is the only judge of the
last. As for the Spectators, tho, by reason of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
Season, and the extremity of the heat, which when
the Play was first acted was intolerable, we have not had
such numerous assemblies as might have been expected in
Winter; yet as long as I have known the Play-house I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
saw the Company there in letter humour.</p>

               <p>An immortal one: Thy merit is so extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
that Fame cannot do thy actions too much
right, and Fortune can do thy designs no wrong;
but that which is most to be valu'd in thee, is, that
thou art the only Rogue alive who never pretended
to be honest; other Rascals owe their success to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
Thou alone hast a genius to go through thy
business without the help of Hypocrisie.</p>

               <p>Why ay, there's it; so sudden a setting up

renounce Morality by a publick act.</p>

Ha, ha, ha, look in my face, and give me that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel!
Do you know what this modest Gentleman has
done with in these three days? 'Sbud I baffled an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent

Guardianship over me, but the disposal of me in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;

me, then the one half of my Estate to descend to my

               <speaker>Bull. s.</speaker>
               <p>Their folly; no, 'tis their prudence Sir, and
the genius which they have for business. Much
contemplation hinders business Sirrah and they know
it well. Why should nature, that can as easily make
a wise man as a fool, make a hundred fools for one
wise man, if she did not know the fools to be most
proper for the carrying on her grand design?</p>

and what a constant Cully reason is to Passion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the exposing the credulity of an errant Ass could
never shew us any thing. Besides, I have taken so
many precautions, that every part of this design is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
likeliest in the world to succeed. There are some
Gentlemen of my Unkle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were formerly my intimate friends and from whom
humanity has oblig'd me since not wholly to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
my self. Collonel <hi>Medley,</hi> who is the chief of
them, and the <hi>primum mobile</hi> of this whole affair,

and you know common interest to be the
powerful uniter of all parties. The rest of those
Gentlemen I have engag'd in my design, by remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
to them the villany of my Unkle's intentions,
and the innocence of my own, and by the hopes of
diversion. The Gentlemen and my Money together
have secur'd some Rascals who perpetually haunt
my Unkle; and all his Servants have embarkt on the

let Ladies do what they will besides, let them censure

Cuckold her Husband, thinks she has a priviledge to
beat him: Formerly indeed I was one of the wicked,
for I gave my Husband his choice, whether he would
have me a chaste, repining, obstreperous Turtle, or a
silent, dutiful, humble Jilt; and the good man chose
Cuckoldom and Quiet. In troth, he was a very good
man, Daughter! He was wont to say, that the Wife
who upbraided her Husband with her Chastity, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
that she cornuted her Monster in Spirit abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him actually, because she had no mind to Cuckold
him, where a Devil lay the obligation to her?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>So that, as I was saying, Daughter, my
good wretch chose Cuckoldom and Quiet; one for
the happiness of this world, and the other for that of
the next. And thus I was formerly one of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:

               <speaker>Belv.</speaker>
               <p>Why, then for his parts, Madam, Nature has
been a very niggard to him: She has made him a
poor Dog, but he is contented, and so far he may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sylv.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, this you have spoken in his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

the matter, denotes a man of Judgment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Belv.</speaker>
               <p>True, Madam: But, like some old Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40409:16"/>
he is not only contented in his poverty, he is
proud in it: Like a Stoick, at the time that he is
scandalously <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecessitous, he affirms that himself is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rich. An humble Fool is one of Gods creatures,
and consequently very good: Ignoranee and stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

your downright Fool, for native folly is a necessary
foyl, and serves to set off the Brillant of Wit, but
affectation is false and counterfeits it, to cheat us of
our good opinions.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Belv.</speaker>
               <p>Right, Madam: He who courts our applause
by affecting Wit, is a cheating Beggar, who asks Alms
with a false Certificate; and every pretending aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Fop is a Knave as well as a Fool. In short, this
is so vain a Coxcomb, that he would be contented to
feel himself miserable, that others might imagine him
happy; and would be satisfy'd to be a Sot in his own
judgment, that he might pass for a Wit in the opinions
of other people.</p>

               <p>Yes, a man of sense may be puff'd up some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,

               <p>Well! The Devil take me, all this is very

this be a dream, or real. Hold! let me see! <stage>[Pulls

at my Fathers: Because, that shews that what they
pretend to to be they really are, Women of fortune
and quality, (but of that what hapned just now would
convince an Infidel.) Yet, when I found that this old
Lady was as passionate an admirer of quality as I am
my self, and that she was resolved to have a Peer for
her Son-in-law; why then I wish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to another place. I told the Countess that my

name was <hi>Dorant,</hi> Son to Viscount <hi>Dorant,</hi> for Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Bull</hi> would have sounded hellishly. Besides, it
would have made a discovery, for she knew me by
my other name in <hi>France.</hi> I have ordered the
Servants here to confirm my lye, which they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to do. The Lady is desperately in love with
me, that is certain: if I can secure her before my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sees me, all is well, otherwise all is ruin'd; for
he will infallibly use me like a Dog, and so discover
me to be the spawn of a Citt. But see the Countess.

               <p>As Gad shall save me, not for the world, Sir,
the bare mention of such a thing had like to have
thrown her into a second fit: She swears she'll dye a

before she was sure of his heart.</p>

               <p>She gives her self a vain trouble, let me
perish. For, may I pass for the errantst Coxcomb in
nature, if I were not the first in love of the two. The
first time I had the happiness to be near her was in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nival

appear in disguise; and where I fell desperately in
love with her. It was a fortnight after that; that she
first cast her Eye upon me as I was walking in the

but she said that was not sufficient to to justifie her

For when my weakness comes to be divulg'd, says she,
people who have a mind to be censorious will say, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing

               <p>Nay, they'll say, continued my Daughter,
that supposing she could have known that he lov'd her,
without hearing him speak, how could she tell but
that he was a fool? For in troth, Mr <hi>Dorrant,</hi> a fools
face may do as much execution as yours. Now, she
who can love a fool, says my Daughter, must certainly
be little better. Is it then for Mr <hi>Dorrant</hi>'s credit
or mine, to have it said that the Conquest of me is
owing to his Eyes alone? If it were known that he
had made love to me, people would attribute that
Conquest to the force of beauty and wit in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</p>

               <p>Why, you must know, Madam, he has a
Son who is a very pretty Gentleman, and one for
whom I have a greater kindness than I have for any
one, excepting your Daughter: And I have wonder'd
a hundred times how, so very a Bear as the Father,
could get so witty, so gallant a person as the Son: I
suppose he had help, and some interloping Courtier
slyly came in for his snacks. And yet the Monster his
Father uses him like a Dog, for which I hate him, and
for which I have sworn not to come n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fools are most subject to little transports, because

            <sp>

               <p>I am very sure. But what should oblige you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bald.</speaker>
               <p>Much about this time. After that I Justice <hi>Balder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe,</hi>
had examin'd your Unkle and <hi>Frowzy,</hi> at my friend
Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi>'s house, and had commanded my Clerk to draw
up their <hi>Mittimus,</hi> I told your Unkle, that to shew him what
favour I could, he should have the priviledge of going in a
Chair, and that <hi>Frowzy</hi> and his Guards should follow at a
distance; so I ordered the Chairmen before they brought
him hither to trot twice round the Garden with him, dismist
the Myrmidons, threw off my disguise, and brought <hi>Frowzy</hi>
along with me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Belv.</speaker>
               <p>Are the Chairmen to be depended on?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bald.</speaker>
               <p>They are my Sub-pimps, and pick up a penny under
me. But can you think to succeed in your attempt, of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40409:40"/>
making your Unkle's house pass upon him for <hi>Newgate?</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Belv.</speaker>
               <p>Are you sure you ordered the Chairmen to bring
him up to this very Chamber?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bald.</speaker>
               <p>I did. And trusty <hi>Joe,</hi> who acts the Jaylor, is
planted at the door; with instructions to receive and guide
them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Belv.</speaker>
               <p>This Chamber, you must know, is dignify'd by the
name of the Devil's Apartment. It has been nail'd up these
twenty years, upon the belief of its being haunted. And,
besides, I have caus'd it to be disguis'd with as much art, as
so short a warning would let me. But is my Unkle suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
scar'd?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bald.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, damnably; and to terrifie him more, there
happen'd the luckiest accident in the world. For just as the
Chairmen were carrying him along, the Hawkers roar'd
out a Proclamation just publish'd, for the apprehension of
Conspirators who are just now discover'd, and I gave one
of the Hawkers half a Crown to bellow out your Unkle's
name; so that when he came to be examin'd, he never so
much as look'd once up upon me. I never saw a more
patibulary phyz: I'll tell you exactly for all the world how
he look'd.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>How, prithee?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bald.</speaker>
               <p>Did you never observe a fellow, who, while the
house has been all on fire beneath him, has been measuring
with his Eyes the leap from the Garret-window. Did you
never observe such a one? Hah!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bald.</speaker>

he was sent hither. Look you old Gentleman, I will touch
this matter as gently as I can to you. Your friends taking
notice that you were grown something foolish, whimsical,
absurd, and soforth, thought fit to have you sent to the
Colledge here, that you might go through a course of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,

               <p>Look you, Sir, it was agreed by Collonel <hi>Medley</hi>
and me, that I should be serviceable to him in the getting
his money for him, and he should be instrumental in the

               <p>He shall. Yet to shew you that my intentions were

               <p>I can never cease to be a friend to any one, because
he's in an unhappy errour. For to err is humane, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40409:47"/>
whatever is humane may befal the best of us. I know the
Collonel to be a man of honour, and men of honour in all
parties have the noblest Relation.</p>

               <p>Well, Nephew! To shew you that this generosity
has touch'd me, set but that intreaging head upon inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
once more, and find out a way to rid me of this Beldam,
and her Daughter, so that I and my Son may never hear
more of them, and the Town may never talk of the business,
and I here promise not only to approve your Marriage, but
to pay the five thousand pound to the Collonel my self im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Belv.</speaker>
               <p>Why then, Sir, know, that as you at the time that
you fancied your self in <hi>Newgate,</hi> were very safe in your
own house here, so your Son, tho he imagins himself link'd
in Wedlock, is still the master of his Native freedom, and
as a sham Magistate committed you to an imaginary Prison,
so a counterfeit Priest betray'd him to a chimerical Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
and <hi>Baldernoe</hi> here, who was the Justice that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
you, was the Priest too who fetter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Gadsbud, let me hug him for it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Belv.</speaker>
               <p>And now, Sir, I hope you are satisfy'd, that I have
been so far from ingaging in a Cheat, that I have only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
you to do justice to my self, and my friend.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Belv.</speaker>
               <p>And instead of bringing misery and infamy upon my
Family, I have endeavour'd, by opening your Eyes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
your being cheated for the future, and consequently
to prevent your real misfortunes, and your future Infamy.
And first, for you, Cousin, I hope what has happen'd will
something cool your passion for quality, which has so often
run you into so many inconveniencies. For we have taken
an effectual course, to shew you that a bare Title is but an
imaginary excellence, which, though it sometimes shows
and adorns true Merit, yet it never gives it, and does not
always suppose it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bull s.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Belv.</speaker>
               <p>As for you, Sir, I have hopes that what is past, may
somewhat assuage your itch of Caballing, and correct your
Credulity. What has happen'd, may serve to convince you,
that there are in all Parties, persons who find it their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

to deceive the rest, and that the one half of every facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
makes a property in Fee-simple of the other: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if I may presume to advise you, never believe any thing
will or will not be, because it is agreeable or contrary to
your humour, but because it is in it self likely or improbable.
And that for the future, you may be secure from more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
attempts than mine, learn to check your Vanity,
and to moderate that heat, which you show upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
and to humble your Pride. For credulity in men
engaged in a party, proceeds oftner from Pride than Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And it is the hardest thing in the world to impose
upon an humble man.</p>
