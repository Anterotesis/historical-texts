            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>How vain are all the hopes on which we build?</l>
               <l>Whate're we ſow, 'tis Death ſtill reaps the field:</l>
               <l>'Tis by this Tenure Mortals hold their Breath,</l>
               <l>To give it up when e're 'tis call'd by Death.</l>
               <l>Our Life is only lent us upon truſt,</l>
               <l>Whether we will or not, we muſt be juſt:</l>
               <l>Heaven has to all appointed ſoon or late,</l>
               <l>To undergo the power of cruel Fate:</l>
               <l>But hark! what ſound is't ſtrikes my trembling ear?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Saunders</hi> is Dead! good Heaven! what is't I hear?</l>
               <l>Is <hi>Saunders</hi> Dead, that Noble Worthy Man?</l>
               <l>His Life is done before it ſcarce began:</l>
               <l>He was but ſhown unto the wondring world,</l>
               <l>When lo into the ſilent Grave he's hurl'd.</l>
               <l>Lament, lament, a Learned Judge is gone,</l>
               <l>The Laws bright Star, that ſo Divinely ſhone,</l>
               <l>To ſteer the wandring Courſe of thoſe fond Men,</l>
               <l>VVho thought all Law and Reaſon dwelt with them.</l>
               <l>But ſoon as our Chief Juſtice was eſpy'd,</l>
               <l>Their Shifts and Fallacies all ſunk and dy'd,</l>
               <l>Like Miſts that riſe before the Morning Sun,</l>
               <l>But vaniſh all e're half his Race is run:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Saunders</hi> in time, though ſhort, has liv'd, yet more</l>
               <l>Then thouſands Older, that have been before.</l>
               <l>Some Men need try but part of their true ſtrength,</l>
               <l>To lay their Foes before them at their length;</l>
               <l>Whilſt others ſtrive with heavy weight in vain,</l>
               <l>And came Ignobly off with bluſhing ſhame:</l>
               <l>But <hi>Saunders</hi> was by Deſtiny deſign'd,</l>
               <l>To be the Joy and Honour of Mankind:</l>
               <l>A General Good was his Unerring aim,</l>
               <l>'Tis that alone which gives Immortal Fame.</l>
               <l>He did with Prudence firſt himſelf adviſe,</l>
               <l>And then he taught the Nation to be wiſe.</l>
               <l>When he had gain'd the Maſtery of the Law,</l>
               <l>For Publique Good he did his Forces draw:</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>To ſerve his Country was his higheſt care,</l>
                  <l>For which great end he did ſo Nobly dare,</l>
                  <l>His Soul not capable of unjuſt fear.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>When in a lower Sphear, how did he move,</l>
               <l>And gave clear ſigns what he wou'd higher prove;</l>
               <l>Great force of Nature in his parts was ſeen,</l>
               <l>Which yet, Refin'd by <hi>Art,</hi> more glorious ſhine.</l>
               <l>Hard Labour, Induſtry, and ſweating Toyl,</l>
               <l>Went to compleat this wonder of our <hi>Iſle;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He knew, ſince the firſt Man was Curs'd, that pain</l>
               <l>And trouble was the only way to gain</l>
               <l>True Honour, therefore did his ſtrength imploy,</l>
               <l>In that which always gives the trueſt Joy.</l>
               <l>Kind Providence Rewards induſtrous Care,</l>
               <l>But Lazy wiſhes Heaven will never hear;</l>
               <l>Let thy Example lead our Young Men on,</l>
               <l>None knows to what with Study he may come;</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>What ſoul ſo ſtupid, but takes generous Fire,</l>
                  <l>When he but thinks on thee, whom all admire,</l>
                  <l>He feels warm Glory through his Breaſt inſpire</l>

               <l>His drouſie Faculties, and ſtraight does find,</l>
