         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS no one can be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
than your Self,
in Vindicating Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and diſcouraging it's
Opponents; ſo without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
I may ſay, no one
is more able to take upon him
ſuch a Task; of which You
have long ago ſatisfied the
<pb facs="tcp:103742:3"/>
World, by appearing Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
in the Defence of That
College, of which You are
now a very worthy Member.</p>
            <p>And as you have given a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
full Proof, that you are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
qualified to Defend
Learned Men from the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of thoſe who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to Oppoſe them; ſo it
conſequently follows, that I
could not poſſibly make choice
of a fitter Patron for this Book,
which is a Vindication of all
Learned Phyſicians, from the
vain and falſe Pretences of an
ignorant Man.</p>
            <p>And tho', I preſume, to
ask your Patronage of this
<pb facs="tcp:103742:3"/>
Book, yet it is not becauſe
I think the Adverſary I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
againſt, nor all his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
formidable Opponents;
but becauſe, any thing that
carrys with it a Vindication
of that Learned Society, of
which you are a Member,
cannot have a more proper
Name prefixed to it than
Yours, who have ſo ſignally
appeared in their Defence.</p>
            <p>But tho' it be an Honour to
appear in ſuch a Cauſe, yet it
is not that which bears the
higheſt Place in your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter:

which are the Meaſures
and Rules of all your Actions,
make you Uſeful both to the

Part of your continual Care
to inſtil into young Men
a juſt Veneration for a Deity
and noble and great Notions
of the extraordinary Merit of
ſo great a King.</p>
            <p>And your Prudence is not
more remarkable in reſpect of
the Publick, than your own
Private Affairs, where Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Learning are the ſure
Guides of ſucceſsful Practice,
and Vertue and Tranquility
extend themſelves through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>Theſe are but ſhort Hints
of ſo great a Character as the
Conduct of your Life affords
materials for; a Character which
<pb facs="tcp:103742:4"/>
claims a better Pen, than mine
to take a Draught of, and
which one that is intimately
acquainted with thoſe Vertues,
in their utmoſt Extent can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>For which Reaſon I fear,
that whilſt I only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE Doctrin of Acids and Alkalies
hath been ſo long ſince rejected, as
Falſe and Erroneous, by the Famous and
Honourable <hi>Robert Boyle</hi> Eſq; and others,
that it is a wonder, any Man ſhould have
ſo much Impudence, as to advance it afreſh;
without anſwering thoſe Objections, which
have ſufficiently proved the Inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of it, much more to dare with ſo much
Boldneſs to Contradict all Learned Men, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch falſe Grounds as Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi>
hath done.</p>
            <p>And therefore I think it fit to acquaint my
Reader briefly, with the true State of the
Controverſy, that he may more clearly judge,
<pb facs="tcp:103742:6"/>
how far he is from Truth in what he hath
writ; and what Reaſon I had to write in
the Method I have.</p>
            <p>In ſhort then, they muſt underſtand, that
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> hath endeavoured to Account
for, and to cure moſt Diſtempers, upon ſo
falſe a Bottom as the Doctrin of Acids and
Alkalies, which hath been long ſince rejected
and laid aſide, by all the moſt Rational Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians;
and that herein he hath been ſo bold,
as not only to tell all the World, that they were
miſtaken; but hath taken upon him to call
Univerſity-Learning, nothing but fuſty
Philoſophy, and all Rational Phyſicians all
the ill Names he could invent, impudently
complaining, that he was ſorry to ſee Phyſick
a Scene of Slaughter.</p>
            <p>Theſe Imputations, with a great many more,
hath he laid upon the World, and if we look
into his Books we ſhall ſee very little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for it; for he hath not only Err'd with the
Vulgar, in building all his Writings on a falſe
Doctrin; but to ſhew how grandly he is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
he hath proved himſelf two Removes
<pb facs="tcp:103742:6"/>
from Truth; for granting the Doctrin of
Acids and Alkalies true, what he hath ſaid
will not hold, ſo that he muſt needs be doubly
miſtaken.</p>
            <p>And therefore in Anſwering his Books, and
laying open his Faults, I all along proved,
that granting the Doctrin of Acids and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies
true, what he ſays it falſe. And
here it is not amiſs to declare a little more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that tho' I have argued againſt his Books,
as if the Hypotheſis he built upon were true;
yet, I don't at all grant it to be ſo, only to
ſhew how widely he is distant from Truth;
for to have ſhewn that he only Erred in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Doctrin of Acids and Alkalies,
would but have proved him guilty of a Fault,
that hath been common to others as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
but his Faults are of a more abſurd
kind; for which Reaſon, it is excuſable, that
I have treated him in ſuch a proper Manner,
as to repreſent the Man, as well as the
Phyſitian.</p>
            <p>However, I muſt confeſs, that tho' I
have proved him guilty of ſuch grand Faults,
<pb facs="tcp:103742:7"/>
both in Phyſick, and his Behaviour towards
the Learned World, yet it wants an Apology,
and perhaps may be no ſmall Diſadvantage to
my Arguments, to mix ſuch Remarks as I
have amongſt them; for which Reaſon I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
my Reader to conſider the State of the
Controverſy, and the Perſon against whom I
write; it is not a Man who hath the good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
and Approbation of Learned Men,
but (like a Mountebank) the Cry of a few
of the Rabble, and one that hath done his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
to caſt all the Aſperſions he can upon
Learning and Learned Men, and therefore he
ought to be uſed in his kind; to be ſerious
with ſuch weak Nonſence, would be to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
Learning, and to expoſe my own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to the Cenſure of the Learned; and
to Compliment ſuch a vain Perſon would be
to make no diſtinction betwixt Men of Sence
and Merit, and the moſt notorious Block-heads,
which would be a greater Affront to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men, than any he hath given: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt Men ought to be Uſed according
to their Merit; and it would be Ridiculous
as well as Unjuſt to put Learned and Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:103742:7"/>
Men upon a Level, as to treat a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Offender and a just Man alike; how
Ridiculous and Weak would it be for a Lawyer,
when a Priſoner is indicted for heinous Crimes,
to moderate his Pleading, as if he were a
juſt innocent Man?</p>
            <p>But that what juſt Reflections I have
made, may be no Diſadvantage to my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I would deſire my Reader to conſider
the Arguments, and them apart, and ſo he will
have the Advantage to ſee how my Arguments
confute him, and how my Remarks are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon Conviction of his grand Errors, and
tho' it be common to ſay, that Remarks,
tho' Juſt, cloud Arguments, and prejudice
the Readers, yet I would not lay ſuch things
to their Charge; I believe, Rational Men
who have the Uſe of their Reaſon, can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
betwixt Remarks and Arguments,
and can without prejudice conſider the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
as the Merit of the Man, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as againſt his Books.</p>
            <p>And here I think it neceſſary to let the
World know that Dr. <hi>Coward</hi> having late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
writ a Book againſt ſome Part of Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103742:8"/>
his Books, Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> hath been
pleaſed to put an Advertiſement in the latter
End of a Book publiſhed ſoon after, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he ſays Dr. <hi>Coward</hi>'s Book is not worth
an Anſwer; I therefore ſhall tell him, that
he only ſays ſo becauſe he cannot anſwer it;
and for that Reaſon, I ſhall conclude, that
if he does not Anſwer Mine, he really can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not;
and becauſe I have made ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
on him, which perhaps may be too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
I ſhall put him in a way to prove, that he
does not deſerve them, which will be by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Reaſons I have given againſt
his Books are not valid, but if he does not do
that, the Remarks properly belong to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grounded upon his Errors.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more which I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
my Reader with, which is, that in
Anſwering his <hi>Novum Lumen Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicum,</hi>
his <hi>Eſſay of Alkalies and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,</hi>
his <hi>Appendix</hi> to that <hi>Eſſay,</hi> and
his Book Entituled <hi>The Doctrin of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies
and Acids further Aſſerted,</hi> &amp;c.
I have all along quoted the firſt Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of thoſe Books, that the <hi>Reader</hi> may,
<pb facs="tcp:103742:8"/>
if he pleaſes, turn to thoſe Quotations,
which will ſave thoſe that have the Firſt
Impreſſion the Trouble of looking into the
Second.</p>
            <p>All that I have further to ſay is, that if
there be any Faults in the following Sheets,
I muſt beg the Reader to aſcribe them to the
haſte in which they were writ, the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
writ in a Month's time when I was in
<hi>London</hi> the laſt Spring, except the laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Perſon bit by a Viper, which Book
of his being not publiſhed before I return'd
to <hi>Oxford,</hi> a few vacant Hours there
were employed in an Examination of it.</p>
            <p>And now leaſt the <hi>Reader</hi> ſhould think
that I publiſh the haſte they were writ in, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be taken for a quick Writer than to
excuſe my Faults, it may not be amiſs to tell
him, that my chief Reaſon, is, that I would
not have the World to think that the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of ſo weak an Adverſary required
longer time than was neceſſary to write it;
for I would by no Means have the World to
think the following Sheets the Product
<pb facs="tcp:103742:9"/>
of a longer Conſideration, Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi>
his Faults being eaſily diſcern'd at the firſt
Sight, by any one that hath made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in <hi>Phyſic</hi> ſufficient to enable him to
diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi> and
therefore I humbly ſubmit them to the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<hi>Reader,</hi> hoping they will convince the
World of his Miſtakes, and deter young and
leſs judicious Practioners from following
his Abſurd Methods, in doing of which, if
they may be ſerviceable to young Phyſicians,
I have my Deſire, <hi>I</hi> ſay young ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                  <head>AN
EXAMINATION
OF
Mr. John Colbatch,
HIS
Novum Lumen Chirurgicum, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>PRIDE and Incivility are ſuch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Concomitants of Ignorance
and Self-conceit; that wherever the
Latter and Naturally imbred in a
Man void of common Senſe; the former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
flow from them, as Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of a depraved Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>It is on this Account, that I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to correct the Inſolence of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
by ſhewing how weakly he manages
his erroneous and invalid Aſſertions; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
how widely and uncivilly he his miſtaken,
contrary to Experience and Reaſon, and the
Authority, as well as the private Opinions of
Learned and Judicious Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103742:11"/>
But before I proceed to lay open his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,
I muſt make an Apology to the
World, for taking that Liberty in my Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
which moſt properly repreſents him in
his Character: As for himſelf, all I ſhall ſay
is, that if what I ſhall write of him diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
him, he muſt blame himſelf for it, and
not me; it is from what he hath publiſhed
that I draw his Demerits, and if he hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
Aſurdities, he can beſt Apologize to
himſelf; and muſt not blame me, for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only, what he himſelf hath laid publick
Grounds for.</p>
                  <p>However, it is not without ſome Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that I engage my ſelf in ſuch a Cauſe,
where the Ignorance and baſe Deſigns of a
ſelf-conceited Man obliges me in Juſtice to
his Character to make uſe of Language
I ſhould otherwiſe be aſhamed of. But the
undoubted Merit of that very unlearned Mr.
<hi>Colebatch,</hi> never too much admired for his
wonderful Genius, in ſcribling Nonſcence,
and his Dogmatical Poſitiveneſs in laying
down Falſities, to the great Satisfaction of all
thoſe who love Nonſenſe in a homely Dreſs,
I ſay, this mighty <hi>Hero</hi> hath taken ſuch
Pains to write down ſuch Specimens of his
profound Diſabilities, and his aſſuming Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that ſhould I not ſtudy for ſuch Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
I ſhould be guilty of Miſrepreſenting
him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103742:11"/>
But before I engage my ſelf in a Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſuch mean and indigeſted Nonſenſe,
I think it may not be unfit to let the World
know, that it is not with a deſign to get
Victory, Credit, or Applauſe, that I oppoſe
ſuch a mighty Champion, ſince all Judicious
and Learned Men laugh at his Childiſh, Crude
and Shallow Notions; and are amazed at his
Impudence; but it is partly to undeceive thoſe
People, who are overcome by his weakneſs
and miſled by him, who want Judgment and
Knowledg to perceive his Errors, and to arm
themſelves againſt large Pretences. For the
greateſt Part of Mankind know ſo little of
Phyſick, nay are ſo Ignorant of it, that when a
Man is bold and poſitive, they cannot imagin
that he can have ſo much Impudence, to pretend
to Knowledg, if he was really Ignorant: that
this is the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> I ſhall take Pains
to ſhew, what he writes being an Inconſiderate
piece of confuſed and incoherent Aſſertions.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore lay open his Errors ſo
fairly, that the World may be no longer impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon, in a Matter that is of ſuch Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
as the Health or Deſtruction of
ſome, tho' a ſmall Part of Mankind; for
if ſuch fatal Abſurdities, as thoſe which Mr.
<hi>Colebatch</hi> hath broached, were not corrected;
what Miſchief might be done? Or rather
what might not be done? By ſuch Methods as
he irrationally and injudiciouſly aſſerts, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103742:12"/>
practiſes, by his own Hands, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Phyſicians who are too eaſily credulous,
and miſguided by him.</p>
                  <p>But it is not only to undeceive the Vulgar
and Unlearned, that are thus eaſily impoſed
upon, that I engage my ſelf in this Cauſe:
But to defend and vindicate the Royal Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Judicious Society, the College of
Phyſicians, and all other Learned Men, from
his ungrounded Impudence, his rude aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Behaviour, and the Aſperſions he hath
boldly caſt upon all rational and regular Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians;
daring to aſſert without Reaſon or
Foundation, what is repugnant to the moſt
Celebrated Writers, whoſe Writings are back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and confirmed by the daily Experience
and Univerſal Conſent of thoſe Members,
who are not byaſſed by Intereſt, or that
dont value the Cry of the Vulgar, above the
Approbation of Learned Men; and that have
not engaged themſelves to cry up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
tho' by never ſo diſhonourable Methods
or abſurd Means.</p>
                  <p>And the Conſideration of the Greatneſs of
ſuch a Deſign, encourages me to ſlight and
contemn all the Aſperſions that may be made
by ſuch bold Impertinent Pretenders; for I
am ſo far from valuing the diſpleaſure of half a
Dozen of ſuch, above the meritorious Cauſe of a
whole Body of Learned Men; that I profeſs I
had rather deſerve the good Opinion of one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103742:12"/>
ingenious Learned Man, than oblige a
hundred Block-heads.</p>
                  <p>And now if a Reaſon ſhould be asked, why
I ſhould be ſo zealouſly concerned, in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Body of Men, who are much more able
to vindicate themſelves; I muſt alſo anſwer
for them, that it is below them to take notice
of ſuch mean and weak Aſſaults; and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in Diſputes with ſuch impotent Aſſailants;
where ſo little is contained, that the moſt
ſuitable Anſwer to ſuch an inſolent vain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
from Men placed by eminent Learning
and Judgment ſo far above him, would oblige
them in Juſtice to themſelves, and him, as well
as the Cauſe they Defend, to reprimand him
and correct his Folly, with Words and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
more ſevere, perhaps, then what their
Manners and Civility would permit them
to make Uſe of.</p>
                  <p>For if ſuch Men as the greateſt Part of that
Learned Society is made up of, ſhould ſo far
condeſcend as to uſe Civil Language to him,
where he deſerves the contrary, they would
by that means bring Reflections by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
upon their own Judgments; and too much
demean themſelves in ſuch ſordid Company,
for ſhould they convince that ſmall Part of
Mankind (who are ſo eaſily captived by Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks
and ſuch vain Pretenders,) that his
Methods and Practice were never ſo diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
the Conqueſt would be no Advantage
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103742:13"/>
to them, nor tend to their Honour; it being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, to take notice of a Man Unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Ignorant and Vain; yet Rude, Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited,
and Impertinent. And truly had I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great Opinion of my ſelf, I ſhould think
my ſelf no Gainer by ſuch a Victory; which
the leaſt Degree of true Sence and Reaſon
can aſſure any Body of: And as the Matter
now ſtands, I ſhould think my time ill ſpent,
and ſhould blame my ſelf, for making no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Uſe of it; if the Reaſons I have already
given did not prevail with me, <hi>viz.</hi> To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
the Vulgar, and to Vindicate the
Honour of ſo many Learned Men; for what
ſtrange Notions muſt thoſe that admire him
frame of the College of Phyſicians and Him;
and what hard Thoughts muſt they beyond
Seas have of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phyſicians, to ſee
ſuch a poor Patch of a Phyloſopher, that hath
but three Words of any thing that looks like
Phyloſophy in all his Scribling, and thoſe
Nonſcence, ſet up for a Champion; and one
that boldly aſſerts without Reaſon or any
ſhew of it, undertake to be a Reformer of
Phyſick in <hi>England;</hi> a Nation, that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
abounded with the moſt Sagacious Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men and the greateſt Improvers of Phyſick.
I ſay, what muſt theſe think? Should not
his Vanity be corrected and deſervedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
ſo that the Honour of ſuch a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
will yet be another Addition to my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103742:13"/>
for uſing him according to his Deſert:
And it will be yet more excuſable when by
Repreſenting truly his Character and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to all Learned Men, and his Erroneous
Abſurdities, in Contradiction to all Reaſon and
Experience, it appears how ill he deſerves not
only of Phyſitians, but Mankind; and how
Impudently he is miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore give a true Account of his
Character and Behaviour, which I ſhall do by
way of Remarks on his Writings, that they
may not ſeem to be without Grounds; and I
ſhall unvail his Weakneſs and Miſtakes, in
what he hath aſſerted and writ, and ſhall
prove that he hath more Reaſon to be aſhamed,
than boldly fond of ſuch Miſtakes; in
which, all I have ſaid of him already or can,
will be but the ſame Meaſure that he hath
Meaſured others; and tho' he did not at all
deſerve it, I might have more Reaſon to take
any Liberty, in the worſt Sence, with him,
and might make a better Apology for it, than
he can, for what he hath ſaid to Men to ſuch
his Superiours.</p>
                  <p>But this being a public Accuſation, and
the Charge I have laid to him being alſo Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,
it is fit the Proof of it ſhould be ſo too;
to which End, it is neceſſary to take a View
of thoſe things he has wrote; wherein the
Grounds of this Charge is laid by his own
Pen.</p>

                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103742:14"/>
The <hi>Firſt</hi> Elaborate Piece of Service this
famous Author was bold enough to do the
World, was, to paſs away two or three hours
time for thoſe that had two much leiſure, in
Reading about ſix ſheets of Paper to which
he perfixed a Title, and would have the
Book to be thought <hi>Novum Lumen Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
a Title that made very fair Promiſes,
and might probably raiſe ones Expectation;
but when I look'd a little further upon the
Title, And ſaw his Name writ in <hi>Latin,</hi> and
withal his Book in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
to read it over; which when I had
done, I began to think, that there was more
Senſe and Learning in the Title Page than
the whole Book; for it was not only a neat
Compoſition of Capitals; but Learnedly
writ in <hi>Latin,</hi> and which ſignified ſomething,
tho' very inſignificant, I mean <hi>HIMSELF,</hi>
whereas his whole Book was but a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of a greater Number of Letters, which
ſignifie nothing at all but incoherent Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                  <p>But he was not only Cheat enough to ſett
a falſe Light in the beginning of his Book, to
miſlead People in their Expectations, and
to ſecond that, with his Name in <hi>Latin;</hi> but
alſo, had the Pride and Vanity to fix the
Name, of ſo <hi>GREAT</hi> and <hi>ILLUSTRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUS</hi>
a <hi>MONARCH,</hi> as our preſent
<hi>KING</hi> before it; either becauſe he thought
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103742:14"/>
it a Noble Preſent, or that the <hi>GREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEST</hi>
of <hi>Princes,</hi> and the <hi>Patron</hi> of all
<hi>Europe</hi> would be pleaſed to take notice of
ſuch erroneous and grand Miſtakes; which
Dedication was ſufficient to ſhew, that he had
very ill Deſigns, or very fooliſh and vain
Thoughts. But to come to the Treaſure,
and to lay open this Fountain of Light, we
may take Notice, that Pag. <hi>2d. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
his Account of his Diſcovery maimed and
imperfect, without premiſing an Account of
Nutrition.</hi> So that if his Account of Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be falſe by his own Mouth, his own
Diſcovery is confeſt Maimed and Imperfect,
that he may firſt then be judged by the Words
of his own Mouth, I ſhall now ſhew him that
that is not only Falſe, but Ridiculous. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag. the</hi> 3d. <hi>he ſays,</hi> The ſolid Food we eat, being
well chewed in the Mouth, is the remixed with a Juice
contained in the Glands, diſperſed all over the Mouth.</p>
                  <p>Before I go any further, I ſhall here obſerve,
that he neither underſtands what he ſays, or
that Nonſence is ſo homogenous to him,
that his dull Sence can taſte nothing elſe; for
how can we ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Saliva</hi> in the
Glands, can poſſibly be mixed with Meat
in the Mouth; he might as well ſay, that
Water in a Ceſtern being mixed with Meat in
his Stomach, would dilute it; for before
that <hi>Saliva</hi> can be mixed with Meat in
the Mouth, it muſt be forced out of thoſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103742:15"/>
Glands, into the Mouth; for as long as it is
in them, it is kept from mixing with the
Meat, by the Mediation of thoſe Parts that
lie betwixt the Glands and the Mouth; but
this is only a <hi>Lapſus Liguae,</hi> and an Abſurdity in
Speech: I grant it, but then, is not he the
greater Blockhead that underſtands a thing no
better, than to ſpeak one thing, when he
ſhould ſay another: Had the Notion been his
own, he might indeed have miſexpreſſed it, by
being too intent and thoughtful; not that the
difficulty or abſtruſeneſs of the thing, would
have inclined him to ſuch a Fault, but his Dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Apprehenſion, it being eaſy for any one
to think, that the <hi>Saliva</hi> muſt be in the
Mouth or could not be mixed there without
much Intentneſs; but ſince it was, not his own,
and he had only borrowed it from others he
might have eaſily expreſſed it, as thoſe had
done before him, without turning Sence into
Nonſenſe, <hi>in Order to a well Performance</hi> as
he calls it Pag. <hi>2d.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. <hi>4th. The Meat being well chewed,
and afterwards conveyed to the Stomach, and
there diluted with a proper Vehicle (the more
Generous the better) is by means of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid</hi>
Spirituous Saline <hi>Liquor, divided into
ſuch minute Particles, which conſtitute that
viſcid Liquor, we call Chile.</hi> That a hard
Cruſt of Bread, is uſually well chewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſwallowed, and then goes into the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103742:15"/>
Stomach, is no Diſcovery, but what a Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or a Ballad-ſinger might have made,
and as for his <hi>(more Generous the better)</hi> it's
what all hot Heads uſually argue for; they
had rather have the <hi>(more Generous,)</hi> tho'
any one that underſtands Reaſon, will ſay,
Moderation is better: and yet further Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
will tell him, that too high a Digeſtion
raiſed by the <hi>(more Generous</hi>—) is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and is the cauſe of ſome very Violent
Diſtempers: And then, here he hath committed
juſt ſuch another Abſurdity, as he did before;
for inſtead of ſaying Chyle is made or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of ſolid Meat diſſolved, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Vehicle, he ſays, it is made of ſolid
Meat diſſolved, which is diluted by a <hi>ſaline</hi>
Humour and a Vehicle, and that thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
ſo diſſolved, conſtitute Chyle; ſo that
Chyle conſiſts according to him, of ſolid Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
and that Chyle, is only diluted by a
Vehicle; but this is a Fault againſt his Will,
he meant it as it ſhould be, I warrant; but ſtill
that ſhews, what ſimple, clowdy Notions he
hath of things, that he cannot tell a ſtory
after another Man, without miſrepreſenting
it, and is he, vain ſilly Creature, a Reformer
of Phyſick? is this his <hi>Novum Lumen?</hi> in one
Sence indeed it may be ſaid to be a <hi>Novum
Lumen,</hi> it being the firſt of this kind of Sence,
obſcured by Nonſence, and he may call it
Light made New, by being made Obſcure
and Ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103742:16"/>
But he goes on and ſays; <hi>Which Chyle
is diſcharged out of the Stomach ſo faſt as it is
made, by means of the Liver.</hi> But here he is to
learn, that that which he calls <hi>Chyle,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called <hi>Chymus,</hi> and that becomes <hi>Chyle</hi>
by being further digeſted by a Mixture and
mutual Fermentation of the Pancreatick Juice
and Choler with it, in the Guts; he is alſo to be
taught, that the <hi>Chymus</hi> is not forced into the
Guts by the Liver, but by the muſcular Coats
of the Stomach, and partly diſpoſed to that
Protruſion, by it's own Weight; for the Liver
is ſo far from preſſing upon it, ſince it is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
to thoſe Parts to which it's Ligaments
are fixed, that the Stomach rather preſſes upon
the Liver, when it is diſtended, by taking up
more Room in the Abdomen.</p>
                  <p>Pag. the <hi>5th.</hi> he ſays, <hi>it is Carried by a
large Veſſel from the Receptacle of Chyle to the
ſubclavian Vein;</hi> here again, Poor Man! our
Author Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> hath gravely in the
midſt of his dull Dogmatical Poſitions, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
himſelf; for the Chyle is not carryed thence
by one, but by two Veſſels, which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with one another in their Aſcenſion; ſo
that all he hath hitherto ſaid is made a <hi>Novum
Lumen</hi> or new kind of Light by his unlucky <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Linguae</hi> or rather <hi>Errores Calami,</hi> but here for
once, his Memory hath fail'd him.</p>
                  <p>He ſays further, <hi>that it is driven by the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole
of the Heart, through the Arterial Vein into the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103742:16"/>
Lungs; where by the Contraction and Dilation
of the Lungs it is there mixed with the Blood, and
that part which is fit for that Purpoſe is made
Blood.</hi> He did well to ſay, that Part which is
fit for that Purpoſe, but I am perſwaded none is
fit for that Purpoſe as ſoon as mixed with the
Blood. Neither is mixing with the Blood e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to turn freſh <hi>Chyle</hi> into Blood, if it
were, we ſhould never be ſo long recovering
loſt ſtrengh after great Evacuations; but here
<hi>our Novum Lumen</hi> hath found out too quick a
way to make Blood; for <hi>Chyle</hi> requires a long
Digeſtion and Fermentation, and undergoes
many conſiderable Changes, before it is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Blood.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 6. he ſays, <hi>the Remaining Part of this
Serum is made uſe of for Nutrition.</hi> I ſhall not
here inform him how Nutrition is carried on, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall I ſpend time in making Remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; but all I ſhall ſay is, that ſince he ſays
it is ſo, I think it a ſufficient Anſwer to ſay it is
not ſo, and had he given Reaſon for what he
ſays, I would have likewiſe given Reaſons for
what I ſay, but as it is, my Word may be taken
for it, as well as his.</p>
                  <p>But here I cannot but admire how he hath
demonſtrated Nutrition, ſince like an Injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Ignoramus, he hath only given a Falſe, Simple
Imperfect Account of what others have given
clear and intelligible Accounts; neither can I i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
how we muſt underſtand any thing that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103742:17"/>
is to come after, the better for this dull <hi>Praeludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi>
ſince none that can pretend to the leaſt
Degree of Knowledge, can be ſo ignorant of
what he fooliſhly thinks he demonſtrates, as
he himſelf is.</p>
                  <p>Having laid his Abſurdities open to the
View of the moſt ſhort ſighted thus far, I could
willingly decline traceing this <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
further; and conclude, that ſince he hath
not explained Nutrition, what he hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſay is Lame and Imperfect, being
tired with ſuch dull and impertinent Stuff.
but leaſt he ſhould vainly think, (ſince Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſo eſſentially belongs to him,) that I decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it upon any other Conſideration, I ſhall
ſhew him, that what is behind, is altogether
as obſcure, as what hath gone before.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 7. He is not aſhamed to ſay, <hi>That he
kept Blood as it came warm out of the Veins,
in a continued violent Motion, and inſtead of
hindring, it facilitated it's cooling.</hi> This is ſo
ridiculous an Experiment, and ſo much below
a rational Creature to make, that one would
never ſuſpect any one that pretends to Sence
or Reaſon, ſhould ever be guilty of trying
ſuch; for the Circumſtances of the Blood
agitated in an organized Body are ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
from thoſe of Blood agitated in an
artificial Veſſel, that there is not the leaſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of the Succeſs of it; but as it ſhews
what a deep profound Blockhead he is, and what
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103742:17"/>
good Anatomiſt he is, ſo from hence we may
gather, what a fit Man he is to advance Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes
in Phyſick, and ſearch into the
ſecrets of Nature; and as one would never
think one ſo eminently dull, ſhould have a
Face to appear in Publick; ſo one would ſcarce
believe that one guilty of ſuch an Abſurdity,
ſhould pretend to Senſe or Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>He goes on. <hi>That Fire which I judge to be in
the Blood, I ſuppoſe is quite different from Culin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
Fire.</hi> A pretty ſuppoſition for a Judge to
make: But he muſt conſider, that his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will paſs but a little way, ſince he is
only a Judge of his own making; but with
a leſs degree of Judgment and Suppoſition too,
one that is Ignorant of Phyſick would agree
in the ſame Opinion with him; but I ſuppoſe
there is no ſuch Fire as he ſuppoſes, and the
Reaſon I ſhall not give; becauſe I ſee he gives
Reaſon for nothing that he ſays; which makes
me believe, he ſcarce knows what Reaſon
is.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 8. <hi>There is an Old Maxim,</hi> nihil dat
quod in ſe non habet, <hi>which is very pertinent
to the Point in hand, from whence he Infers,
that if there were not Fire actually in the Blood
before, he cannot underſtand how a Fiery ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
can be obtained from it.</hi> Truly that
old Maxim is no where more verified than in
himſelf; for as I ſee nothing of Sence come
from him, ſo I really believe he hath nothing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103742:18"/>
in him, and I think it very Pertinently point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at him, but before he inferrs any thing
from it, I muſt tell him, that he ought not to
make any Advantage of a Maxim, that is
Learnt in <hi>Univerſities,</hi> where nothing is
taught but fuſty Philoſophy, as Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi>
has learnt to call it, in his Preface to his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of the Gout; but as fuſty Philoſophy as
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s if he did but underſtand how to
limit that Maxim a little better, he would not
be ſo ignorant; for it implies, that <hi>nihil de
novo creatur,</hi> but <hi>Mutatio Formae non eſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi>
and the Form of Matter may be changed
ſo as to make even Water combuſtible, which
if he had read the famous Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> or <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi>
he needed not be ignorant of, or did he
underſtand <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> but he owns he does
not underſtand it, and truly I am ſorry one
that underſtands ſo little, ſhould pretend to ſo
much; but if he will take Pains to read thoſe
Books I recommend to him, or come to me,
I ſhall be willing to inform him; provided
he does it with a Deſire to learn. I ſay, come
to me; becauſe it is ſcarce worth any Bodies
while, to take the trouble upon them of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
one ſo dull of Underſtanding; ſo that
I may more boldly beſpeak ſuch a Scholar, as
one too mean for Great Maſters.</p>
                  <p>In the next Place, he ſuppoſes a ſimple Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and makes as ſimple an Anſwer, which
I think not worth my while to take notice of.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103742:18"/>
There are ſome things in the ſame Paragraph
he ſays he does not underſtand, and indeed I
believe him, but why is he ſo ignorant, and
is bold enough to ſay ſo, yet pretends to
Knowledge? but if he'll take Advice, he
may underſtand all theſe things with a little
Pains.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 10. He ſays, <hi>The confuſed Mixture of
Blood and Serum, is carryed back from the
Lungs, by the Venal Artery, into the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle
of the Heart.</hi> Here he is again miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
for I muſt tell him, that Blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be properly ſaid to be carryed back to the
left Ventricle, except it was carryed from the
left Ventricle to the Lungs; for carrying
back implies. A Motion of the ſame
Blood, through the ſame Vein, contrary to the
Tendency of that Blood before; but this is a
Fault, whith is perhaps but Metaphorically
ſpoken, and in reſpect of the Heart.</p>
                  <p>He goes on, <hi>and from thence protruded by
means of the Great Artery, which is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
divided into a great many Branches, to all
the Parts of the Body.</hi> Here he hath again
forgot himſelf; for the <hi>Aorta</hi> is not diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to all the Parts of the Body, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cannot carry Blood to all the Parts,
ſince the Liver is chiefly ſupplyed by the
<hi>Vena Porta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. 11. He pretends to explain Nutrition,
of which Account, nothing belongs to him,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103742:19"/>
except one Sentence, which is, <hi>That the Parts
of Bones are diſcharged by inſenſible Tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
but to ſweat Bones is ſo ridiculous, that
with the whole World I cannot forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at him, and I hope every Body is ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he either does not expreſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
himſelf right, or that he is not only a
bold, but very harſh Aſſerter, of what his Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
would laugh at him for. But P. 12. He ſays
he <hi>hath not Arrogance enough to pretend to,</hi> &amp;c.
tho' he had Impudence enough for it the Page
before.</p>
                  <p>From Pag. the 12. to the 17. he hath filled
his Book with Quotations, unworthy to be
placed in his Book, all which prove, That the
Maxim, <hi>nil dat quod in ſe non habet,</hi> as he uſed
it before, is falſe; and that ſeveral ſorts of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
are made out of one; but he confeſſes,
Pag. 12. he knows not how.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 17. <hi>(I think there is no difference, only
ſecundum majus &amp; minus, between thoſe Waſtes
made by Tranſpiration, which are Natural, and a
Wound made by Force, which is Preter-Natural.)</hi>
What he hath hitherto writ, I have proved to
be made up of nothing but Miſtakes in Speech
and Memory, but here we have an Inſtance,
that his Memory is not only very bad, and his
Tongue worſe, but withal, he is worſe at
thinking, and theſe Imperfections muſt needs
qualify an Apothecary for an Eminent Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian;
but as for his Thought, I think it as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103742:19"/>
fooliſh a one as ever I reard, and truly if it
had not been placed in his Book, I ſhould
have gueſſed, it could have been properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to no Body but himſelf, it eſſentially
agreeing with him <hi>ſecundum majus &amp; minus;</hi>
for the difference betwixt a Conſumption of
the Parts of the Body by Tranſpiration, and
a Wound, is ſo great, that there is no
Compariſon to be made betwixt them. Beſides
Waſtes by Tranſpiration are not Natural, but
Preternatural.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 18. <hi>Suppoſe a Wound be made, and it is
no matter where it is, for what will cure a
VVound in one Place will do it in another.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Imaginary Wounds are as eaſily cured
in one Part as another, and it is no matter
where they are; but with real Wounds it is
not ſo; for in ſome Parts they are incurable,
and that the ſame thing that will cure one
Wound will not cure another, any old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that knows how to plaſter a cut Finger,
would have told him.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 19. He ſays, <hi>There is no Wound made
by Inciſion, but may as properly be called a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſed
one:</hi> But here I muſt inform him, that
as the Word Inciſion is only proper to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
a Wound made by a ſharp Inſtrument; ſo
Contuſed, ſignifies a Wound made by a blunt
one, and the Diſtinction is proper and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;
for when I ſay a Wound is made by
Inciſion, it implys, that the <hi>Labia</hi> of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103742:20"/>
Wound are not jagged and torn; but when
I ſay a Wound is a Contuſed one; it ſignifies
that beſides a Diviſion of Parts, there is a ſort
of Dilaceration of the Parts ſo ſeparated; and
the Difference betwixt a Contuſed Wound
and a Wound by Inciſion, is more than what
he ſays, <hi>viz. a larger ſpace betwixt the Labia,</hi>
for in a Contuſed one the <hi>Labia</hi> are not only
more ſeparated, but are hindred from grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together again, by the bruiſed Parts that
lie betwixt them; but indeed, if he would
ſignifie a Bruiſed Wound by the Word Inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a Wound commonly called by Inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the Word Contuſed, then it would but
be the ſame thing as to call him an Aſs inſtead
of a Man, and an Aſs a Man, and both thoſe
Wounds cannot with ſo great Conveniency
be ſignifyed by one Word, <hi>viz.</hi> Inciſion, as an
Aſs and a Man, as far as the latter relates to
him, might be expreſſed by the Word Aſs. But
as by the Word Aſs being applyed both to
Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> and a Pedlar's Aſs, there would
follow ſome Difficulties; and it would be a
hard thing to know by that Word, whether of
them was meant; ſo it would be inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to ſignify a Wound by Contuſion, and
an Inciſed Wound, by one Word without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 20. <hi>I ſtick not to call a Fibre a Veſſel.</hi>
Truly it is manifeſt, that he will ſtick at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that would go down with one, that hath
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103742:20"/>
loſt both their Senſe and Taſte; but he ought
if he had underſtood any thing, to have ſtuck
at it; for a Fibre is uſed to diſtinguiſh thoſe
Veſſels, that are ſubordinate to others, and of
which others are made; but if he will make
no Diſtinctions betwixt things, He may ſtick
at nothing, be it never ſo abſurd, but call black
white, and white black.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 21. He very Learnedly tells People,
<hi>That whenever they receive any Wound it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
pains them.</hi> This is ſuch a mighty Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
ſuch a wonderful piece of his <hi>Novum
Lumen,</hi> that it is ſcarce to be thought, he was
in his Senſes, when he wrote it; for if he were,
could he ever imagine, that he made any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
when he tells People they have
Pain, which they know themſelves better
than he does.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 22. he ſays, that <hi>A Fever in the
terms of many great Men, is nothing elſe but a</hi>
Nixus Naturae <hi>or endeavour of Nature, or a</hi>
Sanguipurgus <hi>and Purifier.</hi> But here I muſt
tell him, that thoſe great Men are miſtaken,
and ſpeak improperly when they ſay ſo; for
inſtead of being a <hi>Nixus Naturae,</hi> it is
rather a preternatural affection of Nature;
and ſometimes it is ſuch a <hi>Sanguipurgus</hi> that
it leaves the Maſs of Blood, a dull effete
Maſs; the beſt Spirits being ſpent, and the
Sulphureous Particles of the Blood almoſt
conſumed; for which Reaſons, ſome People
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103742:21"/>
after long Fevers, are ſubject to Abſceſſes and
hard Swellings.</p>
                  <p>He in the ſame Page ſays, <hi>A late Learned
Author in his Treatiſe of Intermitting Fevers,
the One only Rational Piece, in my Opinion, that
ever was writ upon that Subject, plainly makes
it appear, that the Seat of Agues is in the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex
of the Brain.</hi> Here I muſt tell him, that
his Learned Author will do him very little
Service towards his <hi>Nova Lumina,</hi> ſhould he
uſe all the Flattery he can think of; but as
for that very Rational Piece, it is never the
more ſo, for being ſo in his Opinion; for it
appearing from what he hath hitherto ſaid,
that he is always miſtaken in his Opinion, it
will be but a ſorry Recommendation to that
Book, that it hath his Opinion along with
it; but to ſay it is the only Rational Piece, is
to ſay, he knows not what Reaſon is; for
the very Learned and moſt ingenious Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
hath writ a far more Rational Piece on that
Subject; and the Learned Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> hath ſaid
more on that Subject, than his Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;
who hath not demonſtrated the Seat of
it; but ſuppoſe he had, what's that to his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit?
he bears no ſhare in the Performance I
ſuppoſe.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 23. He ſays, <hi>I could bring many more
Arguments to prove that not only Symptomatick
Fevers, but all ſorts of Continued Ones, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from Heterogeneous Particles.</hi> Truly,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103742:21"/>
what Arguments he could bring, prove nothing
till they are brought; but I have not ſeen any
One yet; for before the 22. Page, he ſaid, a
Fever was nothing, but a <hi>Sanguipurgus</hi> and a
<hi>Nixus Naturae;</hi> but now in contradiction to
that, it's come to Heterogeneous Particles;
but if his Memory is bad, who can blame him,
yet one would think he might eaſily have
look'd back to the Page before; but there is
yet an Excuſe to be made for him, That emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and ſhallow Heads, like hungry Dogs, who
have empty Stomachs, ſo eagerly purſue, and
are ſo taken up with what's before them, that
they ſcarce take notice of what they have
ſwallowed.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 24. <hi>I don't at all ſee or underſtand, that
ſhe (i.e.</hi> Nature) <hi>is aſſiſted by the Medicines
they afterwards uſe.</hi> Really I don't know how
he ſhould; for the Methods the Generality
of Prudent Chirurgeons uſe, are above his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;
but becauſe he does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them, are they ever the worſe for that? Is
that an Objection?</p>
                  <p>Having given an Account of Nutrition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a ſimple and incoherent Manner; an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
made up of nothing but Miſtakes; and
Forgetfulneſs; and having made ſome rude Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on a Body of worthy and experienc'd
Chirurgeons, from Pag. 26, to Pag. 40. He goes
on to applaud and cry up a Medicine to that
Height, and to endeavour to cry down a whole
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103742:22"/>
Body of ingenious Men, that all the World
might think him the only valuable Man in
his Trade; and would fain make the
World believe, that he can do more with his
Medicines than all of them; and this moſt
ridiculous Piece of Inſolence, he endeavours
to confirm by a few pretended Inſtances of
Cures.</p>
                  <p>As for his Account of Nutrition, I have
ſufficiently laid it open; ſo that it plainly
appears to be nothing, but a confuſed, dull
Lump of Miſtakes and Blunders; ſo that for
ſuch a Man, that cannot write common Senſe,
in a Matter too where he needed only to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
what was ready to his hand, for ſuch an
ignorant, ſhort-headed Man, to pretend to huff
and abuſe, and ſet himſelf above Experienced
Men in their Buſineſs, is a Piece of Inſolence,
ſo unpardonable, that I can ſcarce be blamed for
uſing him no harder than he deſerves; for had
he had Reaſon to boaſt of his Medicine, might
he not have taken a fair and honeſt Method
to make the beſt Advantage of it, without
endeavouring to captivate the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and to raiſe in them a great Opinion of him,
by being ſaucy and rude to his Betters. Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Men are ſo far from diſcouraging Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the Arts they profeſs, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſuch an Eſteem for them that make
them, that they give them all the Honour and
Applauſe due to their Merits; ſo that he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103742:22"/>
might, though civil and modeſt towards his
Superiours, had Juſtice done him without ſo
much Noiſe and Impertinence; but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
being conſcious of his own Weakneſs, and
of the ſmall Value of his Medicine, takes
all the Pains he can to applaud himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he knows it would not anſwer what he
pretended, and might of conſequence be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expoſed for his vain Pretences; he takes
care to tell the World, the Chirurgeons were
all his Enemies, when at the ſame time him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
alone was to be blamed for giving them
juſt Reaſon; but this was only done, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
might think them ſo much his Enemies as
not to believe what they ſaid: But can he
think that the World will be long ſo impoſed
upon, and ſo eaſily? Perhaps a ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that are eaſily drawn aſide by a Parcel of
Mountebanks and vain Pretenders may, but
ſurely wiſe People will ſooner believe a great
Number of honeſt and ſober Men, than one
ſilly, vain, conceited Man, that hath Folly
enough to contradict them.</p>
                  <p>As for his Medicine, that he ſo much boaſts
of, it is but an old Preparation new vampt
up; whoſe Effects are ſo ſmall, that Sea Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Urine have oftentimes done greater
Cures, and Common Salt, or a Solution of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
will as ſoon cure a freſh Wound, where no
large Veſſels are cut, as his Powder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103742:23"/>
And though in ſome freſh Wounds, where
Muſculous Parts are divided, it is of uſe; yet
I am aſſured by a very ingenious Chirurgeon's
own, as well as the Experience of others, that
it is of no uſe, or very little, where Tendons
are divided, in which and ſuch like Caſes, they
are furniſhed with better Medicines of their
own, than any he can pretend to.</p>
                  <p>I need not ſay any thing to thoſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he fills up his Book with, ſince they
have been ſufficiently confuted, and the Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
hath been proved in a Book called <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum
Lumen Extinctum,</hi> &amp;c. He would indeed
endeavour to defend them, by a few more, as
notoriouſly falſe as the former, which he has
laid together in his Vindication; but one Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
is altogether unable to prove another
true; and though he pretends, they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſucceeded, when he had fair Play, yet
ſince when he tryed his Experiments before
Witneſſes, they did not ſucceed, the World
hath Reaſon to believe, that he uſed the Joint
Aſſiſtance of ſome common Medicine, when
he uſed it by himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But I have ſufficiently tired my ſelf, with
ſuch nauſeous Stuff as this Book is filled with;
and when I reflect on't, cannot imagine, how
much Conceit and Vanity he muſt have to call
ſuch Rubbiſh and weak Inconſiſtences, a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum
Lumen;</hi> and I wonder how he could boaſt
ſo much, ſince the weakeſt in that Profeſſion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103742:23"/>
might be aſhamed, that they knew no
more.</p>
                  <p>As for his Medicine, there was no need to
write a Book about it; ſince a <hi>Gazette</hi> was too
good for it; but if he would needs let the
World know, that he had found out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of ſome ſmall Uſe, to Chirurgeons, he
might have taken the ſame Method as <hi>Daffy</hi>
hath with his <hi>Elixir,</hi> and People would have
made as much Uſe of it as they do now, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it anſwered Expectation; but there was
no need for Impudence, except in a bad
Cauſe, and he had no Reaſon to boaſt of a
thing, that cures nothing, but what was cured
by the Uſe of other Medicines, equally as
good as his.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Contains Remarks on his Preface to this Eſſay.</head>
                     <p>HAving gone through his <hi>Novum
Lumen Chirurgicum,</hi> clouded and
ſtuffed as it is, with nothing but
incoherent Miſtakes and notorious
Blunders; I ſhould now go on to ſhew, that
he not only hath the Impudence to boaſt of,
and value himſelf upon, the moſt unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Grounds in Chirurgery; but alſo, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the World will not be impoſed upon
one way, he endeavours to do it another; but
he muſt expect that Phyſicians are not to be
more eaſily deceived with Pretences then
Chirurgeons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:103742:26"/>
He has pretended to ſuch Miracles in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery,
as might juſtly encourage Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Men to make Tryals of his Skill, but his
Pretences being but Vain and Falſe, and all
that plentiful ſtock of Impudence which he
made uſe of in vindicating his Folly, being
not ſufficient to procure him Buſineſs amongſt
Chirurgeons, he now is reſolved to turn Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
and uſe all the baſe and inſolent Means
he can, to make himſelf taken notice of by
thoſe that are too eaſily credulous to ſpecious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Promiſes, cloaked with Dogmatical and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Poſitiveneſs.</p>
                     <p>But from what he hath already ſaid of
Nutrition in his former Book, any one that
underſtands common Senſe ſo much as to be
able to diſtinguiſh it from Nonſenſe, will
be ſatisfied, that he is by no means qualifyed
for a Phyſician: Yet tho' he hath given the
World, one would think, a clear Specimen
of his Ignorance, and that he is a mere vain
pretending Emperick; he hath ſtill the Face
to appear not only againſt Chirurgeons, but a
whole Body of Learned Phyſicians, and tell
the World, that no Body knows any thing
beſides himſelf, when it plainly appears, that
he is altogether ignorant, ſhallow and widely
miſtaken in thoſe things he moſt pretends
to.</p>
                     <p>To make it appear, I ſhall in the next
place take a View of what he ſays of Acids
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103742:26"/>
in the Cure of Diſtempers, and ſhall ſhew,
that he neither underſtands the Nature of
Alkalies, nor of thoſe Acids he ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols,
and alſo, that what he irrationally and
ſo dogmatically aſſerts, contrary to all Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Writers and common Experience, is very
fooliſhly advanced; and that the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſuch abſurd Practice are very dangerous
as well as the Practice it ſelf very pernicious,
and not to be followed without the greateſt
hazard of the Lives of thoſe that are ſo much
miſled as to make uſe of him, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themſelves to the irregular and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Methods of ſuch an abſurd Practicer.</p>
                     <p>And before I examin the grand Miſtakes
of his Book, I ſhall take notice of ſome
things he hath premiſed in his Preface, which
will lay open his Deſign; and the Method
he takes to impoſe upon thoſe, that want
Judgment to diſcover his Faults.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt thing I ſhall there take Notice of,
is, that in the fifth Page of his Preface he
ſays,</hi> There are ſome particular Preparations
of Steel and Antimony, the which giving as
Alkalies, and as they are generally believed to
be, did me very great Service; but ſince I have
well examined them inſtead of Alkalies I find
them to be moſt noble Acids, and the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
cured by them did not proceed from Acid,
but Alkalious Particles.</p>
                     <p>Here we may ſee what Methods this ſhort
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103742:27"/>
ſighted Reformer intends to take; for where
he hath not the leaſt Pretence that Acids are
uſeful in the Cure of Diſtempers, there we
muſt expect that rather then he will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
his Doctrin of Acids, he will change
the very Names of Things, and call Alkalies
Acids and Acids Alkalies; for thoſe Medicines
that are uſed in the Cure of Diſtempers, and
now called Alkalies, he muſt needs call A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids;
by which Rule, I would think him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the wiſer, if he could prove, that Bitter
Medicines will cure ſuch Diſtempers as Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
are generally uſed in; for it is but calling
thoſe Alkalies Bitters, and then the Buſineſs
is done, and by the ſame ſort of Reaſoning
(for it is all the Reaſoning he can pretend to,)
I might prove to the World, that he is worſe
then the very Beaſt of the Field; for it is but
changing his Name and inſtead of calling him
Mr. <hi>John Colbatch,</hi> A <hi>Wooden Statue:</hi> but this
is a way to raiſe new Opinions indeed; If a
Man muſt be no longer called ſo, but a Horſe,
and a Horſe a Man; it would not be an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Knowledge, but an unneceſſary
Alteration of the Names of Animals; at this
Rate there might be as many Books writ, as
fooliſh Men could invent Names for Things.
But that Steel is not an Acid when it is uſed for an
Alkalie, I ſhall hereafter ſhew, and that Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
are not the Cauſes of thoſe Diſtempers,
that are cured by ſuch Medicines; in the mean
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103742:27"/>
time it is altogether ſufficient for me barely
to Contradict him, ſince I have all Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Judicious Men to confirm what I ſay,
and he barely aſſerts without Proof or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     <p>A little after, having made a Confeſſion
that he was an Apothecary in <hi>Worceſter,</hi> a
little after that he endeavours to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Qualifications of that Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that People may judge whether he was
not by that means qualified for a Phyſician;
but who would he have to judge; if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
the Qualifications of an Apothecary,
that Phyſitians might judge, whether that
Profeſſion had qualified him for a Phyſician
or not; he might have ſaved himſelf the
trouble; for they know better what will
qualify one for an Apothecary, and how far
that comes ſhort of a Phyſician, than he can
tell them; but if he deſigned thoſe that do
not underſtand Phyſic ſhould judge of him,
he ought alſo to have informed them what
Qualifications are neceſſary for a Phyſician,
otherwiſe they are not capable of judging;
but by his Writings it is plain, he is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with thoſe Qualifications; neither
indeed if we muſt judge of him by thoſe
Rules he hath laid down, as Qualifications
for an Apothecary, is he qualified for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary;
for,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:103742:28"/>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> he ſays; <hi>An Apothecary muſt be well
acquainted with the Vegetable Kingdom, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to know the Faces of Plants, but their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Manner of Operation upon Human
Bodies: Otherwiſe how can they tell how to
handle them, ſo as to make Compoſitions as they
ought to be.</hi> Now that he wants this firſt
Qualification is very plain; for if he does not
underſtand human Bodies, it is impoſſible he
ſhould know how they operate upon thoſe
Bodies; that he does not underſtand
human Bodies is manifeſt from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he hath given in his <hi>Novum Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
which I have ſhewed to be Falſe and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</p>
                     <p>But under this firſt Qualification he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſays; <hi>Every Phyſician ſuppoſes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
ſo Qualified, when he preſcribes to his
Shop.</hi> But here I muſt tell him he is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
for as it is not neceſſary that Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
ſhould be ſo Qualified, ſo ſuch Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
are not expected by Phyſitians that
preſcribe to them; for an Apothecary may
compound Medicines without knowing the
Nature of thoſe Medicines that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds;
for all Apothecaries make up their
Compoſitions according to Receipts in which
they are directed, how to mix them, and
what Quantity of each is to be mixed; ſo
that it is enough for one that makes up a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103742:28"/>
Receipt to know Weights and Meaſures, and
what Directions are writ before him, and to
be acquainted barely with the Faces of things:
For it not belonging to Apothecaries, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
or preſcribe any Medicines, except by
the Order of a Phyſitian; it is enough for
them to know how to follow a Phyſitians Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections;
which they are enabled to do, by
knowing how to chuſe <hi>Simples</hi> and <hi>Compounds,</hi>
ſo as to diſtinguiſh them by their Names, and
how to mix them according to Art.</p>
                     <p>He further ſays, <hi>Let a Phiſitian preſcribe like
an Angel, &amp;c.</hi> I would willingly know how
he comes to be acquainted with Angels Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions;
and whether he has learnt them or
not: I am afraid they are ſeldom catched in
Apothecaries Shops, and conſequently he hath
been very little acquainted with them. But,
as I believe, Angels are always imployed in
Divine Affairs; ſo they chiefly are concerned
in Spiritual Preſcriptions; and here Mr. <hi>John
Colbatch</hi> hath fetch'd his Metaphor too far.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>he ſays;</hi> The ſecond Qualification
for an Apothecary, is, that he underſtand the
Nature and Operation of Minerals and Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
                     <p>To underſtand the Nature of Minerals is
the Buſineſs of a Chymiſt, not of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,
and as for their Operations, that
chiefly belongs to a Phyſitian; whoſe Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
it is to apply them: But he would needs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103742:29"/>
have Apothecaries to underſtand every thing,
becauſe he hath been one himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he ſays, <hi>They muſt underſtand the
Nature of Animal Bodies;</hi> but I am ſure they
may be as good Apothecaries, tho' they do
not; for what Buſineſs hath an Apothecary
with Human Bodies, ſince it only belongs to
him to be ſerviceable to Phyſicians in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Medicines and obeying his Orders,
and not in adminiſtering: He might as well
ſay a Clerk who only writes according to the
Directions of his Maſter, and whoſe Buſineſs
it is to do nothing elſe, muſt underſtand
thoſe things that don't belong to him, <hi>viz.</hi>
His Maſters Buſineſs. What ſome Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
know I won't ſay, but I am certified
by his Writings, and alſo by the Rules he
hath given for the Qualifications of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,
that he is ſo far from being qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for a Phyſitian, that he is by no means
qualified for an Apothecary.</p>
                     <p>But to underſtand how faintly he is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
for either, I ſhall paſs on to his Book,
and ſhew what grand Miſtakes he is poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and boldly guilty of.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Small-Pox.</head>
                     <p>THe firſt Diſtemper he there takes upon
him to give an Account of, is, the
<hi>Small-Pox;</hi> and here contrary to Truth and
all Experience he would ſuggeſt, that the
<hi>Small-Pox</hi> do not proceed from Acids but
Alkalies. And,</p>
                     <p>Page <hi>4th,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Now I could never hear
of any one, that by Analizing the Blood of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in the</hi> Small-Pox, <hi>could ever find the
leaſt Foot-ſteps of Acidity in it; though on the
contrary, it doth appear, after many Tryals,
that the Blood of ſuch Perſons doth more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with Alkalious Particles, than that of
ſound People.</hi> That no Acidity can be found by
Analizing the Blood of Perſons in the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi>
is not ſufficient to determin, whether
there be Acids in the Blood before Analized
or not; for in Analizing Blood, as the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
call it, the Volatile Particles of the
Fire, which is the Agent in the Operation,
may ſoon deſtroy thoſe Acidities; for if
when our Stomach abounds with Acids we
find by taking of Volatile Alkalies, that that
Acidity is ſoon deſtroyed; and if we find
that thoſe Effects, which are produced in
our Blood, upon a plentiful Uſe of crude
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103742:30"/>
Acids, or Aſtringents which are Acids in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia,</hi>
are taken away on the contrary by the
Uſe of Alkalies; we have much Reaſon to
believe, that the Particles of Fire, being
more powerful when in Action than thoſe
Alkalies, will ſoon deſtroy that which is
called Acidity in the Blood; ſo that the Fire
Volatilizing that Acid Matter, and exalting
it to a higher Degree of Maturity, it quite
looſes it's priſtine Qualities, the Fire and it
being united into a <hi>Quid tertium,</hi> and that
united and again embodied in a Vehicle, looſes
it's old Form, and is modified anew.</p>
                     <p>But to determin, whether there be Acidity
in the Blood or not, there would be no need
to analize it, tho' by that means it would
not be deſtroyed; for when a Perſon in the
<hi>Small-Pox</hi> is let Blood, we may ſee a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<hi>Ropy Viſcocity</hi> in the Blood, which is a
certain Sign of Acidity, it being the Nature
of Acids to coagulate and thicken thoſe
Humours with which they are mixed.</p>
                     <p>And to underſtand in what Senſe the Blood
may be ſaid to have more Alkalies than the
Blood of healthful People, we muſt conſider
what is the Cauſe of that Diſtemper; but
as my Deſign here is not to give an Account
of the Cauſe of this Diſtemper, any further
than tends to ſhew how far he is miſtaken, and
how little he underſtands it; ſo I ſhall only
take notice, that the firſt Onſet of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103742:30"/>
is accompanyed with the <hi>Initia</hi> of a
Feaver; where we may obſerve that the
Maſs of Blood being naturally impregnated
with a great deal of Sulphur; and that Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
being as if it were depreſſed, or rather
inviſcated in a Viſcous <hi>Mucus</hi> (whoſe Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocity
proceeds from Acids) theſe Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Particles are by ſome accidental Cauſe
(whether it be Internal, or by the Influence
of circumambient Bodies, I ſhall not now
determine) exalted in ſome Meaſure, and
cauſed to exert themſelves; by which Exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they endeavour to clear themſelves of
that <hi>Mucus</hi> Phlegm; which being ſeparated
from them, the whole Maſs does, as if it
were, run into two Parts; juſt as we ſee ſweet
Milk and Eggs mixed together, and heated
over a Fire, begin to break, as it is uſually
termed; I mean juſt when it begins to
break ſo little that we can ſcarce diſcern it
with a Microſcope; and then that Maſs in
ſome meaſure cleared from the Viſcocity,
hath more Sulphur in it, and more fierce Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Parts in it, than the Blood of a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Perſon. But as for Alkaly, I cannot find
any in it, except Alkalies are Sweet and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick.</p>
                     <p>But yet if the whole Maſs of Blood, and
Serum together, be compared with the whole
Blood, and Serum of a healthful Perſon;
there is more Acid in the Blood of a Perſon in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103742:31"/>
the Small-pox, and leſs Alkaly, than in a
Perſon that is healthful.</p>
                     <p>But this new Reformer of Phyſick ſets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Work, like one that neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
common Senſe nor Reaſon; all that he
ſays againſt a truly rational and confirmed
Opinion, is, that it is not ſo as they ſay;
and the Grounds upon which he concludes ſo,
are an Obſervation nothing at all to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
but to ſhew that he neither underſtands
the Works of Nature nor Art; ſo that thus
far he wants the Qualifications of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary.
But to proceed;</p>
                     <p>Page <hi>the 5th.</hi> He ſays; <hi>The cauſe of the
Small-pox, I ſuppoſe, to be from a Quantity of
ſuch Particles, being ſome way or other admitted
into the Blood; which being of a quite different
Texture from that of the Blood; and ſo not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being mixed with it, cauſe a Hurry
and Diſorder there.</hi> What a very fine Account
this is of the Reaſon of the Small-pox; and
who will be the wiſer for it, by ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
as this; we may anſwer all the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
that can be asked in Phyſick, Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Mathematicks, Aſtronomy, Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Geography without any other Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
than the Aſſiſtance of Nature; and a
common Plow-man, if this be Knowledge,
might give as good an Account of things as
he does: For ask a Plow-man what is the
Cause of the Small-pox, and he will give juſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103742:31"/>
ſuch an Account as he hath done, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the Small-Pox proceed from ſomething that
cauſes them, and diſorders the Perſon that
hath them; nay, a Nurſe knows more than
he can pretend to; for they will give a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
a better Account of a Diſtemper, than
Hurry and Diſorder. But there are two
Words in what he ſays; that Women perhaps
are not well acquainted with, <hi>viz.</hi> Particles
and Texture; but taking away thoſe (which he
does not underſtand, and which only ſerve to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe
People that are ignorant) and then what
he ſays will come to no more but what I
juſt now expreſſed in Words different from
his only in Sound, not in Signification, as
he hath uſed them.</p>
                     <p>And here again, I could willingly paſs by
a great many of his Faults, being almoſt
tired with ſo many, and ſuch groſs Miſtakes;
but ſhould I not trace his Impertinency and
Ignorance, he is ſo apt to be proud of his
Folly, that it would make him but fonder of
what he already is ſo zealouſly panting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as one ſcarce able to make his way
through Clouds and Obſcurity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page the</hi> 6th, He ſays, <hi>Now to aſſiſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in throwing theſe Heterogeneous Particles
out of the Blood, to the extreme Parts; which
they pretend to be mightily hindred, by a great
Quantity of Acids in the Blood: They give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
and large Quantities of Teſtaceous Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103742:32"/>
Powders, which indeed ſeldom fail of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
their Intentions, in throwing out large
Quantities of Puſtles, even more than Nature
is able to ſupply and bring to Maturity.</hi> Here
he only hath put Senſe into his own Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic
Dreſs; ſo that when firſt I read it, I
could ſcarce imagin what he meant, till I
had put that Mask of it; and then it appears
to be that Phyſicians uſually give Acid-Abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
to attenuate that Viſcid Diſtempered
Humor, that it might be thin enough to paſs
off by the Pores of the Body, in order to
carry it out of the Maſs of Blood; and that
this they endeavoured to do by ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
as correct its Acidity; which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
truly is, if uſed with Moderation, very
reaſonable. For ſince by the Viſcocity of
Blood, it appears that Acids cauſe that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation
of the <hi>Fomes Morbi,</hi> which we
ſee in the Habit of the Body; what can be
more reaſonable, than to uſe ſuch Means as
promote the carrying off of this Fuel, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating
it, and correcting that Acidity
which makes it too thick to go off. But he
ſays it throws out too much of this Humor
to which I anſwer (tho' it is ſo ſimple and
inconſiderate, that it deſerves Correction, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a Rational Anſwer) that no more
of this Diſtempered Humor can be driven
out, than there is in the whole Maſs, and
the leſs is left behind the better; for it is not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103742:32"/>
that Matter in the Habit of the Body, that
kills thoſe that ſuffer by this Diſtemper;
but that which is not driven out; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why ſome dye, notwithſtanding a great
deal is driven out, is becauſe a great deal is
ſtill behind; for that in the Habit of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which he, like a Block-head, calls the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Parts, is out of the way of
Circulation, and is leſs offenſive to Nature,
than that which is left behind, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
and mortifies the Spirits before it can
be driven out.</p>
                     <p>But this Method, it ſeems, ſpoils Angelic
Faces: This endearing Expreſſion muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
oblige the tender Parents of pretty
Children to make uſe of Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> by all
means; that pretty Gentleman that loves them
ſo paſſionately, will be ſo careful of their
Beauty, and ſpoiling of Angelic Faces; that
before one of his Patients ſhall have its pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Face ſpoiled with Heterogeneous Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
he will reſolutely give Acids, and ſo
thicken that Heterogeneous Humor, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little ſhall be driven out. But then let
good Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> (ſince he muſt be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
right or wrong) conſider what the
Effects of his Tenderneſs towards Angelic
Faces will be; for if that Heterogeneous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
be thickned and not thrown out, and the
Quantity of it be ſo great, that Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conquer it, the poor Child out of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103742:33"/>
to it's Beauty muſt ſubmit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fate, and unavoidably dye; whereas,
if he endeavour'd to drive it out, it might
more reaſonably hope for Life; tho' the
Quantity of that Matter is ſometimes ſo great,
that the Habit of the Body is not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it all.</p>
                     <p>And let him know, that if by his Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or rather fooliſh Ignorance, his Patients
dye, he muſt once anſwer for it, and might
as well be guilty of cutting their Throats.
And here I have taken a little Pains to give
Reaſons againſt his, and in Vindication of
the contrary Practice; not becauſe what he
ſays in Defence of his own requires it, ſince
he only poſſitively aſſerts without Reaſon;
but becauſe in a Matter of this conſequence,
I ſhould almoſt in ſome meaſure think my
ſelf guilty of the Death of thoſe that ſuffer
by him, if I did not give ſuch Reaſons againſt
his Method, as People might plainly ſee the
Abſurdity of it.</p>
                     <p>But before I proceed any further, I ſhall
make bold to ask my Gentleman one Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
whether he by the Uſe of his Glaſs, hath
in ſome Critical Enquiry or other, found to
his great Regret; that this Diſtemper hath
ſpoiled pretty Features or not in his own
Face? If it hath, then there is one ſort of
an Excuſe to be made for his adhering to
ſuch Practice, and juſt ſuch a one as there is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103742:33"/>
for thoſe People, that had rather keep Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in their Stomachs, than ſpoil their
Mouths by taking a Vomit.</p>
                     <p>But there is another Queſtion I would ask
him, but dare not; and therefore ſhall only
ſubmit this weighty Matter to his profound
Judgment, by way of Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a Man ſhould be an Ill Man, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Ill Houſes; whether in the Enjoyment
of his Pleaſures, he might not pitty, that ſo
many Faces ſhould be ſpoiled by this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and in that ſoft Humor, take ſuch a
Sting againſt all Rational Practice, as ever
to abhor it.</p>
                     <p>Page <hi>the</hi> 7th. He ſays, <hi>The ſpoiling of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
is not all, but beſides they throw out the</hi>
(Diſtemper, which he calls) <hi>many Puſtles by
breaking of the Globules of the Blood,</hi> &amp;c. Here
I need give him no other Anſwer, but
that I pitty him; he fain would be a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher;
and for all his ſtretching and ſtraining
he cannot reach it; but he ought to have
try'd his Strength in private, and not to have
expoſed himſelf with his Philoſophical Scraps,
for breaking the Globules of the Blood is
ſuch Nonſenſe, that had he not made a
ſimple Experiment, by mixing Oyl and Water,
to explain his Notions of Globules, no
body could know what he meant by it; and
it looks ſo aukward; that Philoſophers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but wonder what the Man thought of,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103742:34"/>
when he wrote it; for his Mechanical Head
ſure could never hope to explain any thing,
by breaking of Globules, too large to circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
through capillary Veſſels. For what
Miſchief would breaking of thoſe Globules
do; ſince the Blood without any damage,
muſt needs be divided into much more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
Particles, to circulate through the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.
All he ſays, Page 8, 9, 10, is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
what he here ſo obſcurely delivers, to
which I need give no other Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Page 10. He ſays, <hi>In like manner, the
Globules of the Blood being broken by means of
Alkalious Medicines, together with too great a
Quantity of Alkalious Particles, being before
admitted into it, are, by that means made capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being received into the cutaneous Glands,
which is the only Occaſion of thoſe Purple Spots
upon the Surface of the Skin.</hi> What Effects
Alkalies have upon the Coagulated Humors,
I have before ſhewn, <hi>viz.</hi> They thin them
and make them capable of paſſing through
thoſe Pores, they would otherwiſe be too
thick for, and as for his Globules, if he means
only, that the Maſs of Blood is diſſolved and
attenuated; I Anſwer, That the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo diſſolved, would circulate through it's
Veſſels only with more eaſe; ſo that it would
be leſs ſubject to be coagulated in the Veſſels
of the Skin; but ſince by taking notice of the
Blood in ſuch People, it appears to be more
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103742:34"/>
clammy than it is uſually in healthful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and ſince that Clammineſs depends on
a Mixture of Acids, we have reaſon to believe
that it would be leſs apt to run into Veſſels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that it ought not; and it is alſo Rational to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
ſince the Diſtemper depends on Acids
which coagulate the Blood; that when the
Diſtemper is more violent, it abounds with
more Acids; and conſequently that they
don't only cauſe the Serum to coagulate in
the Pores of the Skin, but alſo ſometimes
the Blood in the Capillary Veſſels; which
coagulated, cauſes thoſe Purple Spots.</p>
                     <p>But leaſt I ſhould not ſeem ſufficiently to
prove, that thoſe Symptoms are cauſed by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids;
I ſhall further obſerve, that, ſince it is
the Nature of Acids to coagulate, and of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies
to prevent and hinder Coagulation, and
thoſe Symptoms appear to be Coagulated
Humors; we muſt needs conclude, that they
do proceed from Acid, and not Alkalizated
Humors.</p>
                     <p>Page 11th. He ſays, <hi>But this is not all;
for by the aforeſaid breaking of the Globules of
the Blood, theſe ſmall broken Globules getting
into the ſmall Meanders of the Brain, hinder
the Motion of the Animal Spirits through the
Nerves.</hi> But I here ask him, hath he ever
found any of thoſe Globules in the Brain? if
he has not, there is no reaſon to believe what
is contrary to Reaſon and Experience. For
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103742:35"/>
                        <hi>Deliriums</hi> are more likely to proceed from
Viſcid Matter affecting the Brain; it being
plain, that there is not only a great deal of
Viſcid Matter in the Blood, but that there is
a Viſcid Phlegm obſervable in all People incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to Lethargies, and ſuch like Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Page the 11th to the 16th.</hi> He keeps
a long Harangue to no purpoſe, and about
nothing at all to this Diſtemper; where he
begins to preamble about the uſe of Acids, to
the 19 Page, to which I need not ſay any
more, having ſaid enough of the Uſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids
and Alkalies at the beginning of this
Chapter. But here he tells us that, <hi>he hath
retrieved a great many from the Jaws of Death
by Acids;</hi> but he hath told ſo many down-right
Falſities in the beginning of his Book,
that we have the ſame reaſon to believe he
does now; what he ſays, being contrary to
Reaſon and Experience; and I rather believe
ſo, becauſe he mentions not one that Acids
cured, where he had uſed Alkalies.</p>
                     <p>Page 20. <hi>I ſhall proceed to the Method I take
in the Cure of it; which being according to
Natures Dictates, is ſhort and eaſie.</hi> Here he
would perſuade us, that Nature is ſhort and
eaſie, becauſe there is very little to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in what he ſays about her; but as eaſie
and ſhort as ſhe is, ſhe is too long and too
difficult for him to trace; but now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103742:35"/>
to give us an Example of his Dexterity in
the Cure. And,</p>
                     <p>Page 21. Tells us, <hi>that he begins with a
Vomit.</hi> But here he ought to confeſs what
Learned Men's Examples he hath followed.
For ſo, if the Stomach be ſoul; thoſe Learned
and Experienced Men, Dr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> begin, therefore for this the
World is not obliged to him; he not being
the Author of that Method.</p>
                     <p>Page 22. <hi>At Night he gives Syr. de Meconio;</hi>
For this ſtill he ought to make an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
to Dr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> it being what he
hath learnt from him.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>ſometimes in the beginning,</hi> Page 25.
<hi>He lets Blood;</hi> for this likewiſe he muſt make
a thankful Acknowledgment to Dr. <hi>Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
it being nothing of his own Invention.</p>
                     <p>Page 23, and 24, 26, and part of the 27th,
he reckons up a Parcel of Acids which he
makes uſe of; but he mixes ſo much ſimple
Waters with the Acids, that what he gives
is ſcarce more cooling than Small-beer; and
truly, if they had not worſe Effects in the
Blood, I ſhould commend him for following
ſo good a Preſident as Dr. <hi>Sydenham;</hi> but
here he varies from Dr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
of his Patients, and the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Lives, though Preſervation of the
Beauty of'em.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:103742:36"/>
And he ſo much depreſſes their weak fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Spirits, that Page 27. He is forced to
give them a Cordial again to take off the ill
Effects of his bad and abſurd Uſage.</p>
                     <p>Page the <hi>28th, He Purges them ſeveral
times.</hi> And truly, if he abuſes them with
Acids at this rate, he had need to purge them
ſoundly, to carry off thoſe Dregs that he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from going off before; whereas did he
manage them as thoſe Learned Men Dr.
<hi>Sydenham</hi> or Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> do, once Purging does
as much good and more, than his five or ſix
times.</p>
                     <p>Page 29 and 30. All he ſays is to deter
People from Uſing any other Means than
his; and to tell People that know better
how to manage Children than he does, that
they may ſafely uſe his Method, if they
won't ſend for him, but let him know that it
is Experience that is valuable, above a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
that hath neither Reaſon nor Succeſs;
and ſurely they had rather depend on thoſe
that have their Characters from Judicious
Men, than one that only commends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Page 31. He begins with his former Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
concerning the Cauſe of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi>
and giving a ſhort Account of what
Effects he laid to the charge of Alkalies,
and continues a Repetition of his Complaint
to Page 36. But I having already anſwered
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103742:36"/>
that ſufficiently, there is no need I ſhould
repeat it here again now, and indeed
all the Reaſon he has, is only to lengthen his
Book; for he cannot think other People are
ſo forgetful as himſelf, as to need to have it
over again ſo ſoon; and if they had, it would
have been the ſame thing to have read the
firſt Account over again, for it was altogether
as large as this, and this is equally void of,
and without, Reaſon or Proof,</p>
                     <p>Page 36, <hi>He aſſigns but one general Cauſe
of Fevers, yet owns the Particles cauſing them,
may be ſomewhat different.</hi> Which is to ſay
and unſay, and at the ſame time to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
himſelf, for if the Cauſe differs it cannot
be the ſame, and that the Cauſe is not the
ſame is plain, becauſe the ſame Cauſe would
have the ſame Effects, I mean the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Page 38. He ſays; <hi>in moſt continued Fevers
I have found Alkalies equally as pernicious
as in the</hi> Small-Pox, <hi>and Acids equally as Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.</hi>
That Acids are uſeful in moſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Fevers, is not of his finding, it being
the common Practice of moſt Phyſicians: And
it is as generally known, that ſtrong Alkalies,
except in <hi>Malignant Fevers,</hi> are very hurtful
and not at all uſed, except by abſurd Practiſers;
but that Alkalies are highly to be preferred
before Acids, in the Cure of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi>
I think I have given Reaſon enough to prove,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103742:37"/>
except People value Beauty before their Lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and had rather hazard their Children in the
Hands of a Fool, than commit them to the
Care of ſober and wiſe Men.</p>

                     <p>HAving therefore run over what he

that it is neither conſonant to Reaſon

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And Page 43. Says he;</hi> My Friends,
have a little Patience, and I will preſently
make it appear to you that thoſe Symptoms are
not occaſioned by Acids, but from <hi>Acrid Lixivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
and <hi>Alkalious</hi> Particles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:103742:37"/>
Behold! How ſharp Witted he is grown
of a ſudden? And, it laſteth for a whole
Page together; what a true Picture of a
ſhort Head? And what an exceſſive Rapture
of Zeal, my Friend Mr. <hi>John Colbatch</hi> is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
into? Truly, if I could believe he were
of any Religion, I ſhould perſwade my ſelf,
he were inclining to <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> as well as
<hi>Quackeriſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> for here he ſeems to have a mighty
glimps of the Spirit, and ſpeaks in a very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
Form. But I wonder why he ſhould
expect all Mankind to cry againſt him; he
muſt either have a very ill Opinion of all
Mankind or himſelf; if he thought he
had Reaſon for what he did, then he ſpoke
very harſhly of all Mankind; for to ſay they
would cry againſt, was in effect to ſay,
they either did not underſtand Reaſon, or
that they were ſuch Enemies to Learning,
that they could receive nothing but what was
ſuited to their own Heads: A very heavy
Charge, and much becoming ſuch an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Man to lay upon all the World; But I
rather think he had a Self-conſciouſneſs of his
own Falſneſs, and, like guilty Perſons, did not
know how to conceal it.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>the Scurvey, he ſays, proceeds from Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious!
Particles, and not from Acids,</hi> to which
I anſwer, that it being the Nature of Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
to thin and attenuate thoſe Humors, that
cauſe Coagulations in the Skin, it is unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103742:38"/>
to ſay, that Alkalies cauſe thoſe Things,
which their own Nature inclines them to cure:
But thoſe Bloches which appear in the Scurvy,
rather proceed from Acids joyned with Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
the Acids cauſe the Humors to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in the Skin, and the Acrimony by
cauſing a Ferment there, makes that Matter
corrupt and corrode.</p>
                     <p>Page 43. He ſays, <hi>The Blood of Scorbutick
People abounds more with Alkalious Parts than
Healthful Peoples when Analized.</hi> But as I ſaid
before, what is drawn from Blood Analized,
proves nothing what was the Temper of that
Blood before it was Analized: Of which, if
he would but take Pains to look into the
famous Mr. <hi>Boyl's</hi> Sceptical Chymiſt, he
may be fully ſatisfied. For thoſe Acrid Acid
Parts of the Blood, being Spiritualized by
the Fire, looſe their Priſtine State, and are
carryed along and embody'd with other Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Particles.</p>
                     <p>Page 45, and 46. <hi>He tells a Story of a
parcel of Seamen, that landing at</hi> Cadiz, <hi>were
cured of the Scurvey by the Uſe of Lemmons and
Oranges.</hi> The leſs Reaſon then hath he to be
fond of, or value himſelf, where he owns
his Knowledge to Seamen; but it is no news
in Phyſick, that Acids joyn'd with Alkalies
cure the Scurvey, it being common Practice
to mix Acids and Volatile Salts in Scorbutick
diet Drinks, and a Method long uſed by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103742:38"/>
Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> and others; ſo that there
was no need for him to have ſaid any thing
here of the Scurvey, ſince it is only what
others have done before, to more advantage,
and incomparably better.</p>
                     <p>Page 47. He ſays; <hi>As for Alkalies, I
don't believe that any was ever cured by them
of this Diſtemper.</hi> But I am ſure that a great
many are, and though a great many are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a Mixture of Alkalies and Acids,
yet as many are cured by Alkalies alone.</p>
                     <p>Page 48, 49, and 50. He mentions a
Preparation of Antimony and Spirits of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
and would have theſe which Page 51, and
52, he ſays are <hi>Panaceas,</hi> to be Acids; but
as they have been generally termed Alkalies,
and are known to be ſo by their Effects; he
muſt not think to change their Names, ſince
he cannot change their Natures: For by their
Effects we know that they correct Acids, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they take away Obſtructions, and diſſolve
coagulated Humors which are thickned by
Acids.</p>
                     <p>But as I took Notice in his Preface, we ſee
he will uſe all the means imaginable to make
his Deſign good; and having ſaid enough on
this purpoſe there, I ſhall not need to repeat
it again.</p>
                     <p>Page 53. He thinks he anſwers an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt him, which is, <hi>That there is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Saltneſs in the Blood of Scorbutick People.</hi>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:103742:39"/>
But he like a Man as dull as ignorant, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
would turn it off, and ſays, <hi>if they will
ſtrictly enquire into it, they will find it not an
Acid but an Alkalious Taste.</hi> But does he
think no Body can taſte beſides himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
People are ſenſible, that for the ſake of his
own Cauſe, his Reaſon, if he may be ſaid to have
any, will byaſs his Taſte; whereas other
People in ſuch Caſes have their Reaſon ſteady
and their Taſte too. But to conclude this
ſecond Specimen of his Ingenuity: He muſt
be informed that the Blood of Scorbutick
People does not only taſte Salt, but thoſe
that ſpit much, and who know what a Salt
Taſte is, find a manifeſt Salt Taſte in that
<hi>Saliva.</hi>

                     <p>He does well to make an ingenuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and be modeſt in ſome things, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to expoſe himſelf the more effectually.
For if this Man can make a Concluſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all the Learned World, upon a little
that he hath ſeen, which he does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;
it ſhows, that he is very bold and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable;
for will he pretend by a little to
contradict a great deal; and will he pretend to
write Univerſal Rules, from a little and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Obſervations; but it ſeems by this little
he is convinced fully, which to me only ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
he hath a very narrow Head. But that
this Diſtemper does not proceed from Acids,
I ſhall eaſily evince; and firſt let us ſee, what
he ſays in Proof of his own Aſſertion, and
what Reaſons he gives for them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page 55.</hi> I have obſerved conſiderable large
Nodes in which are ſometimes contained a hard
chalky Subſtance, which by many Experiments
I have found to be as much an Alkaly as either
Carbs-Eyes, Corral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is an Argument indeed would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
one to believe much, upon a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103742:40"/>
Obſervation, and really, if we may believe
he writes in this Point as he does in all the
reſt, it will be feared, That little is none at all
for he hath hitherto ſo magnified a little, as
to make it a great deal of Nonſenſe; that
here we may ſuſpect, if what he hath ſeen in
this Diſtemper be little when magnifyed, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Argument it ſhews that his head is a lump of

in order that he may comprehend this, that is ſo
much above him, to read and conſider Mr.
<hi>Boyl</hi> of Alkalies and Acids; and if he does
not underſtand that Book, if he will come
to me I'll explain it to him; for I would ſpare
no Pains to undeceive and inſtruct him, I ſee
he hath a mind to learn, and perhaps, if he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103742:40"/>
were put into a good way, though he be dull
Induſtry might make ſomething of him; ſo
that I would not have him diſcouraged,
though he hath loſt his Labour in travailing ſo
boldly and ſo far in a bad Way.</p>
                     <p>In the next Paragraph. Page 55, He ſays,
<hi>Now it being granted that the Matter contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the aforeſaid Nodes to be an Alkaly, how is
it poſſible for this Diſtemper to proceed from
Acids?</hi> He does well to ask Queſtions; for
that is the way to be informed; and that he
may learn, I ſhall tell him, that though that
cruſty Subſtance were an Alkaly, which I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuppoſe, that the Anſwer may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect;
it is poſſible that Acids may be turned
into Alkalies; for all the Difference betwixt
Acids, being as far as relates to our preſent
Purpoſe, that the one hath no Pores, and that
the other hath Pores, to imbibe and receive
the Parts of the other into them; it will be
very eaſily conceived, that a great many of
theſe being embodyed in a Mucilage, and that
Mucilage being hardned, ſo as to link the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
Particles together; I ſay, it will be very
eaſily conceived, that that Subſtance being
made Porous, hath ſo far the Nature of an
Alkaly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pag. 56. Says he,</hi> But if Men will ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
to aſſert, that this Diſtemper proceeds from
Acids, and at the ſame time own the chalky Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
beforementioned, which is only, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103742:41"/>
                        <hi>muſt tacitly believe the Doctrin of Tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though they openly are aſhamed to own it;</hi>
that Noble Sentence, <hi>Doctrin of Tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
had ſo raiſed his Phanſy, that truly he
hath expreſſed this Paragraph very Nobly;
but I ſee he cannot ſpeak in fine Words, but he
muſt expreſs Non-ſence, for where Men aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
the <hi>Doctrin of Tranſmutation,</hi> how can they
be ſaid tacitly to believe it, except aſſerting
be holding ones Tongue; but though, my
Gentleman, thinks it a thing, that one ought
to be aſhamed of, and to be laugh'd at for and
ridiculed; I am not aſhamed nor afraid to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I own the Doctrin of Tranſmutation, and ſo
does he, or elſe he hath quoted no leſs than
three Experiments in his <hi>Novum Lumen Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgicum</hi>
(which I have proved to be <hi>Obſcurum)</hi>
Which he does not underſtand; and which
fill that Book from Page 12. to the 17. But
perhaps the Gentleman means, the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and hath wittily called it
<hi>Tranſmutation,</hi> leaſt he ſhould ſtrain his
Mouth, with ſuch a thundering Word; but
there is a great deal of difference betwixt own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Tranſmutation</hi> in Philoſophy, and that
which is called <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> in Divinity;
the <hi>former</hi> only aſſerting the Texture of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be modifyed anew, when it viſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be ſo; and the <hi>latter</hi> when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
that it is not; ſo that if any Body
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103742:41"/>
hath Reaſon to be aſhamed he wants none, and
he alone deſerves to be ridiculed.</p>
                     <p>Pag. 57. <hi>Suppoſing the Acid Matter cauſing
this Diſtemper to be tranſmuted into a chalky,
alkalious Subſtance, the Diſtemper muſt never
more pretend to come near that part;</hi> this is
a very good Argument indeed, and truly when
I looked upon the whole Page together, here
ſeemed to be a Fault with an ominous <hi>Index</hi>
over it, <hi>viz. Aſhamed, laugh</hi> and <hi>ridicule,</hi> which
Words begin the Page juſt before this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.
But to anſwer his Suppoſition, we know,
that the beſt Alkalies cannot operate beyond
their Power, and though that Subſtance were
an Alkaly, it would ſoon be ſo impregnated
with Acids, as to looſe it's Power of abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more; for ſuch Alkalies no longer correct
<hi>Acidity,</hi> than their Pores are open, and ready to
receive acid Particles into them, and then they
can correct no more, which is plain by putting of
Alkalies into any acid Liquor, which as ſoon as
their Pores are filled, have no further Effects.</p>
                     <p>But he ſays further; Pag. 57. and 58. <hi>Nay,
the Blood at times, must all, or at least great
part of it, paſs through the Part or Parts,
where this chalky ſubstance is lodged,
by which means, a Man would think it ſhould be
ſufficiently guarded from any more growing Acid;
and ſo by Conſequence, when the chalky Nodes are
once ſetled, People have not the leaſt Reaſon for
the future, to be in fear of the Return of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103742:42"/>
Diſtemper.</hi> To this, though what I ſaid in the
laſt Paragraph is a ſufficient Anſwer, I ſhall
add, that though the Blood ſhould ſooner than
he can ſuppoſe it, run through that Part, yet
the Subſtance he calls Alkaly, when it is once
ſufficiently impregnated, could cauſe no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in the Acidity of it; beſides, though
it had it's full Force active and vigorous
ſo much as makes up the Nodes, would no
more prevent the Acidity of the Blood, than
a Grain of Alkaly would prevent a Hogſhead
of Drink from growing ſtale. Moreover, ſo
little Blood could be laid down at once in
thoſe Parts, that the whole Maſs being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,
we muſt conclude, that that little
Blood, as ſoon as it was mixed with the Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
of Blood again, would be again depraved and
tainted; all theſe Objections, I ſay, would
occur, if we would ſuppoſe, what he ſays to
be true, concerning the Blood circulating
through thoſe Parts; but he ſhould take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the Blood Veſſels have no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
with thoſe Nodes, they being, as it
it were, Matter extravaſated, and out of the
way of Circulation; but one hath always
more Trouble to confute one Blockhead that
three ingenuous Men (I don't mean convince
one, for that is a thing not to be expected
but the Reaſon why it is ſo difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
ſuch a one, is, becauſe Fools make ſuch
Blunders, that have neither Senſe nor Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103742:42"/>
and are ſo widely abſurd, that one muſt
run out of Method, and Order, to trace
them.</p>
                     <p>Pag. 59. He ſays, <hi>It may not be amiſs to take
Notice, that few People are troubled with the</hi>
Gout, <hi>but thoſe who drink large quantities of
Wine or ſome other generous Liquors, abounding
with Vinous Spirits, ſo that the Blood and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Juices, being impregnated with the ſaid
Vinous Spirits, theſe Spirits meeting with the
Volatile Alkalious Salt, of which, even the
Blood of ſound People, is never destitute, by
means of which Salt the Vinous Spirit is Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,</hi>
&amp;c. What is the Reaſon that drinking
of Wine is ſo hurtful, I ſhall not here explain,
but ſhall only ſhew, that he is ſo far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
it that, he confutes himſelf, and
that he is at a loſs how to make even trifling
Explanations of it. And firſt I ask him, if it
be cauſed by drinking of much Wine, and that
being Coagulated by the Alkalies in the Blood,
why does not thoſe Alkalies alſo Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
his Acids, that he would cure it by; and
how comes it to paſs, that they ſooner Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate
Spirituous Acids than more crude
ones? But this Objection he did not foreſee,
and truly no body can blame a Man to be thus
bold, that's ſo ſhort ſighted and inapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
of Danger, but certainly if an Alkaly in
the Blood would cauſe ſo Spirituous an
Acid as Wine to Coagulate, it would much
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103742:43"/>
ſooner Coagulate a more crude one, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
his Medicine muſt do more harm
than Wine; ſo that here I leave him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
himſelf. A ſecond Queſtion I ask him,
is, whether it is not impoſſible to cure this
Diſtemper by Acids, if Acids cauſe the Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
in the Blood to Coagulate, to which,
the true Anſwer is, that it is impoſſible; for
as long as the Blood is ſo impregnated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to him, all the Acids we can take, muſt
be Coagulated, ſo that they would increaſe
Coagulations, and not cure them.</p>
                     <p>But not to ask a Man any more Queſtions,
who does not underſtand common Reaſon,
I ſhall prove from what he ſays, and alſo from
Reaſon, that Acids cauſe this Diſtemper, and
firſt, from what he ſays it is plain; for if he
ſays upon taking of Acids the Alkalies Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate
them, it implies there was no Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in the Blood before thoſe Acids were
taken, now if our Blood when ſo full of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies
can be without Coagulation, and upon
the taking, of Acids, it preſently thickens; it
muſt needs follow that thoſe Acids cauſe this
Diſtemper, there being no Coagulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thoſe were taken; ſo that the Acid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulates
the Alkalizated Blood, and not the
Alkaly the Acids; for that is ſaid to be the
cauſe of a Diſtemper, or a Coagulation, whoſe
Mixture with the Blood produces ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
and in whoſe Abſence there is no ſuch
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103742:43"/>
Effect, ſo that here he is judged by his own
Words. For as a Man's head is not the cauſe of
it's being cut off, till the Inſtrument is applyed
that ſeparates it from his Body; and when
Water is thrown in the Fire, the Water is
properly ſaid to extinguiſh it, ſo Acids taken
into the Body, cauſe the Coagulation and not
thoſe Humors that are vitiated by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it, and theſe Inſtances I have given,
that it may be plainer to People that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not Phyſick, I mean thoſe Gentlemen
he ſo oft makes his Appeal to.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Acids being of a cold Nature, and
cool Bodies Naturally Coagulating thoſe
Bodies, that are ſubject to Coagulation; and
it being the Nature of Alkalies to take off
Coagulations, and to prevent them, it would
be abſurd to ſay that they cauſe ſuch Effects
as are quite different from their Nature.
And,</p>
                     <p>That it is the Nature of Acids to Coagulate,
is not only plain from what he hath ſaid, but
it is alſo manifeſt, that Phlegmatick Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are injured, and that Indiſpoſition increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by them; whereas by Alkalies, that <hi>Phlegm</hi>
is attenuated and made fit to be carryed
off.</p>
                     <p>The next Page he would ſuppoſe, that the
Coagulations in the Stone proceed from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalious
Particles Coagulating Acids; but it
appearing from-what I have already ſaid, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103742:44"/>
Alkalies are not, and that Acids are the Cauſes
of ſuch Effects; I need not ſay any more to
this, the ſame being an Anſwer to both.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall only here take Notice of the Strain
and Humour of our Philoſopher, who when
he found it would be neceſſary for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
does not only change the Names of
things; but alſo calls thoſe Humours that
are Paſſive, Active; and on the contrary.</p>

                     <p>THe next Diſtemper that he gives us an

by the Fire Analized the Blood of</hi> Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
<hi>Perſons, I have found it to abound more with
Alkalious Particles than that of ſound People.</hi>
But as I ſaid before, the Analized Blood is not
ſufficient to determine what Blood was, before
it was Analized; but if by mixing thoſe
Subſtances together, which he draws from
Blood, by Analizing it, they will make juſt
ſuch a Compoſition, as Blood; then I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he takes the right Method to diſcover
the Cauſes of Diſtempers, but if they will
not, then it is evident that the Fire modifies
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103742:44"/>
the Parts of the Blood anew, and rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
than diſcovers it's Principles.</p>
                     <p>Pag. 75, and the 76. he would ſuggeſt,
<hi>Acids are not the Cauſe of the Bloods Viſcocity, and
ſays thoſe that affirm that they are, don't prove it;</hi>
And I ſay, neither does he prove, that Acids
are not; But it appearing from what I have
ſaid the Chapter before, that Acids cauſe
Viſcocity, there is no need I ſhould make a
Repetition here.</p>
                     <p>Page 77. <hi>By what I have ſaid, I hope, I have
freed Acids from occaſioning the Viſcouſneſs
of the Blood in</hi> Rheumatiſms; <hi>which Viſcocity
if it can be once taken of, every one knows that
the Diſtemper immediately vaniſhes, but this is
not done by Alkalies but by Acids as Tincture of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
and Chalybeates.</hi> What he hath ſaid, he
hopes is ſufficient, but truly I don't ſee that he
hath ſaid any thing to the purpoſe, as Grounds
of ſuch hopes; but if we believe him, that
<hi>Rheumatick</hi> Peoples Blood abounds with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies
more then healthful Peoples, which is
falſe, it does not therefore follow, that this
Diſtemper is cauſed by Alkalies, becauſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies
according to him, cannot Coagulate
without Acids; ſo that it thence follows, that as
Acids differ in quantity more or leſs, ſo the
Blood is accordingly Coagulated, and then
we muſt conclude, that the Coagulation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on the Acids, and then as I ſaid before
Acid Medicines would increaſe it: But here
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103742:45"/>
to prove that Acids cure this Diſtemper, he
calls two Medicines eminently Alkalious
Acids, by which Rule he may ſay with as
much Reaſon, that a company of <hi>Statues</hi> took
<hi>Barcellona</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and if any Body
ſhould contradict him and ſay that they were
Men, he muſt Anſwer but they ought to be
called not Men but <hi>Statues,</hi> as I call them, and
this is juſt his Caſe, to which, I having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaid enough, I ſhall here ſay no more to
it, but refer the Reader to what hath gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>Pag. 79, 80, and 81. He makes an Haran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
that <hi>Steel is turned into a Vitriol, before
it can be carried into the Blood, and conſequently
acts as an Acid upon it.</hi> But granting it ſo,
I have already ſhewn what would be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
according to his Suppoſition, <hi>viz,</hi> To
encreaſe the Diſtemper, but as he is not the
firſt that hath ſuppoſed it to work upon the
Body by that means; ſo he is not the firſt
miſtaken in that Point, for Chalybeats don't
cauſe ſuch Effects, as we ſee they do, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
turned into a Vitriol, but by abſorbing
thoſe Acids in the Stomach and Pancreatick
Juice; by which means, the Ferment of the
Liver is more powerful, and helps to correct
the Acidity of the Chyle; and the Blood not
being ſupplyed with Acid Chyle, thoſe Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
in it's Maſs, are ſoon altered and digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103742:45"/>
to a higher Degree of Maturity; by a long
continued Circulation and Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>Pag. 82, 83, 84, and 85. are filled up
with two preparations of Steel which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Acids, and a ſtory to tells us, that <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naber
which he once thought an Alkaly proves to
be an Acid.</hi> But it only proves ſo for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,
for there is no Reaſon that he gives
for it, and therefore we have Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that it is, what all Learned Men know
it to be; for it does not only correct Acids
in the Stomach, but is of very great Uſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
always where the Maſs of Blood hath
a manifeſt Viſcidity.</p>
                     <p>And here, before I leave this Chapter I
ſhall obſerve, that thoſe Acids in the Stomach
which he ſays Page 80, cannot get into the
Blood till vitriolized, is a Miſtake; for we
may take notice, that ſome People, if not moſt,
that are ſubject to <hi>Rheumatick</hi> Pains and the
Gout, feel a manifeſt Acidity upon their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs
ſometime before their Paroxyſms; and
when that Acidity is carryed off, they feel the
dreadful Effects of it in the Maſs of Blood.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing it to be turned into a Vitriol,
a Vitriol is but a ſtronger Acid, than that in
the Stomach, and conſequently would do more
Miſchief than if it were not turned into a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol

with the</hi> Serum, <hi>admitted into the ſmall Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules

conſequence Hectick Fevors.</hi> What he means
by broken Globules thrown into the Glands,
I profeſs is ſuch a Peice of Philoſophy, that I
neither ſee that it hath any Meaning or Senſe
in it; for I have already ſhewed, that thoſe
Particles of Blood, which he takes Notice of,
ſwim in the <hi>Serum</hi> confuſedly, muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into an innumerable ſmall Particles
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103742:46"/>
before they can paſs through the capillary Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
and conſequently can do no Prejudice by
being broken; but ſuppoſe they were forced
into Veſſels which they ought not; Acids by
Coagulating the Alkaly, would rather fix
them there, than remove them. Nay allowing
his own way of Aſſertion, which I have before
confuted, <hi>viz.</hi> that Alkalies coagulate Acids, it
would not help him, becauſe thoſe Alkalies
in the Glands could not be removed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own Aſſertion, but by Acids, and
what a Removal would it be, when as his Acid
Medicines were laid down in the Glands, the
Alkaly would coagulate the Acid and ſo fix
it there, as much as the Alkaly.</p>
                     <p>As for what he ſays Page 90, and the 91,
of the Uſe of Alkalies, I don't believe any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Phyſician would ever give any Alkalies
in ſuch a Caſe; ſo that here he might have kept
this Advice to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Page the 92, and 93, he makes a very ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Objection againſt his fooliſh Aſſertion,
and makes an Anſwer to it agreeable to ſo
great a Peice of Nonſenſe; but both of them
being not worth while to take notice of, I
ſhall leave them to the conſideration of thoſe,
that think they deſerve any thing elſe, beſides
a ſharp Reprimand.</p>
                     <p>Page the 94, <hi>He tells us a ſtory that</hi> Rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
<hi>cured one of a</hi> Conſumption <hi>by Conſerve of
Roſes and Oyl of Sulphur by the Bell,</hi> but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103742:47"/>
any one may gueſs what a <hi>Conſumption</hi> it was,
ſince the ſame Remedy, will ſcarce cure an
ordinary Cough.</p>
                     <p>From Page the 94, to the 100. <hi>He tells
a long ſtory of an old Man and a Pot of Oyl of</hi>
Sulphur: But that being nothing at all to this
Diſtemper, but a Story by the by, to fill up
his Book; and leaſt he ſhould ſeem to ſay, not
only, nothing to the purpoſe, but to little for
a Chapter of <hi>Conſumptions;</hi> I ſhall take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it no further.</p>
                     <p>Page the 100, 101, and the 102, he tells ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtory of a Man, who that being bit with
a Viper, could not be cured by Alkalies
and no wonder; for no rational Man would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon a Medicine he knew not the Effects
of, in ſuch a Caſe, but would have immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Recourſe to a proper Medicine.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude this Chapter, it will give
us no little Light into the ſtrange Inſolence of
this Man, who notwithſtanding ſuch ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Books, as the Learned Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Morton,</hi> &amp;c. have writ concerning <hi>Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
and what the ingenious and truly Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Theod. Mayern,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> have wrote
of the Gout, and alſo Dr. <hi>Lister,</hi> with a great
many more, who have largely handled thoſe
Subjects, this Man can have the Impudence to
write, not only contrary to them, but alſo
common Experience; and that too neither with
any Method or Reaſon; for whereas thoſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103742:47"/>
Learned Men have obſerved a great deal of
Variety as to the Cauſe and Cure of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
and that the Cure is to be varyed
according to the different Tempers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of Men; he boldly and very ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly
ſays little or nothing to the purpoſe,
but that, without any regard to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Cauſes, or the ſeveral peculiar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of Men's Bodies; but it is not
ſtrange, that one that hath ſo much Ignorance,
ſhould have an equal ſhare of Impudence;
for vain pretending Quacks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks
have no other way to cheat the World,
but by incredible Relations of Cures, that
were as unlikely as falſe.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall not here enlarge on a Subject
ſo copious as his Vanity and Boldneſs makes
this; but ſhall go on to conſider the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Part of his Book, there being Matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
and too much, for me to miſpend my
time upon.</p>

ſome Inference or other would be drawn

no leſs than twenty yards thick, he forgot

a Speech, without applying it to any thing.</p>
                     <p>Page 105. <hi>There is ſome Reaſon to believe,
that People before the Flood did not eat Fleſh,

This truly is a Sign the Man's Thoughts have
run a little further then his Wit, and then his
ſhallow Head is capable to go with any
ſteadineſs; and truly by the incoherent Style
of his Book, one would gueſs, he was no little
way out of his Depth; But I ſuppoſe this
Noble Addition to Dr. <hi>Burnet's Theory</hi> was no
otherwiſe deſigned, but that People might
know he had heard of ſuch a Book; whoſe
Arguments, he ſays, are to him unanſwerable;
but why ſo? Becauſe they are too Noble and
Curious for him to underſtand, and much
more to anſwer; but however ingeniouſly
that Book is writ (which truly I think, for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103742:48"/>
the Nobleneſs of the Thought, the Elegancy
of his florid Style, and the Command which
he ſeems to have of his Thoughts, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
with the greateſt Eaſe, and without
ſtraining, for them, makes it one of the moſt
valuable Books our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
with) yet it's not exempt from that
Fate, which all Books on that Subject have
hitherto had; and it is only a ſign of Mr.
<hi>Colbatch</hi> his ſhallowneſs, and not of the reality
of what's contained there, that makes the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
unanſwerable to him, though this
muſt needs be ſaid of them; that though they
are not really true, yet they are delivered in
ſuch a Method, that they would Inſenſibly
wind one into a favourable Thought of 'em, if
one were not ſufficiently Armed with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Reflection; but ſo Ingenious and
ſo Learned a Man, as Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> is, being
too good Company for ſuch Ignorance as he
is Eminent in; I ſhall not mix their Names
together any further, leaſt the Luſtre of Dr.
<hi>Burnet</hi>'s Name ſhould ſo dazle Peoples weak
Eyes, as not to perceive the Obſcurity of the
others, and ſhall only conſider the latter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately;
that the Light, which might be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from the former, may not increaſe the
faint Obſcureneſs of his; but that he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in his proper Colours.</p>
                     <p>And how abſurd and ridiculous it is; for to
aſſert that eating Fruit preſerves Peoples Lives,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103742:49"/>
and is the Cauſe of Longaevity; whereas the
generality of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> People, as well as
Phyſicians, are certain, that Fruit cauſes more
Diſtempers in Children; than any one thing
amongſt <hi>Non-naturals</hi> beſides.</p>
                     <p>From Page 107, to Page 112. He tells a
long ſtory <hi>of a Child that was cured of a Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
by being Bathed in Sea Water,</hi> but what
is that to his Credit? Or what does this ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
to the Uſe of Acids in the <hi>Small-Pox,
Scurvey, Gout, Rheumatiſms</hi> and <hi>Conſumptions</hi>?
The common People certainly would laugh
at him ſhould they hear him affirm, that they
all proceed from the ſame Cauſe; he might as
well expect Fire to cool, heat, moyſten and
to dry the ſame Body: But as for that Caſe
of the Childs, had he had the Luck to have
adviſed, that Girl to Bath in Sea-Water,
it would have been ſomething for him to have
talk't of, but as it is, an old Woman would
have told a ſtory that ſhe had heard from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as well if not better than he hath done,
and now ſhould he cure one by that ſame
means, it would be no Credit for him, ſince
he would do no more, than what had
been done in <hi>HEREFORD-SHIRE.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Page 112, He tells us <hi>what</hi> Helmont
<hi>hath</hi> found by Experience in the <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury,</hi>
viz. <hi>to cure it by cool Diureticks,</hi>
and what Diſcovery is this pray, any rational
Phyſician would have given either that, or a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103742:49"/>
Medicine much better in the ſame caſe, but
<hi>Helmont's</hi> Obſervations are none of his; and
he hath no ſhare in the ſmall Credit of
it.</p>
                     <p>Page 113, He ſays, <hi>An eminent Man took off
Heart of Urine by Juice of Oranges;</hi> and what
then, do not other Phyſicians give cold
Diureticks upon the like occaſion, neither do
they value themſelves upon ſuch things at all,
as are common and every where practiſed,
but this it ſeems induced him to try Tincture
of Antimony in the like caſe; which ſince I
have already ſhewed to be an Alkaly, and
that he only calls it an Acid to ſerve his turn,
I need not enlarge any more now. But the
Reaſon why he thinks it Acid, I believe, in
this caſe, may be, becauſe he obſerved that
Acids cured this Diſtemper, and could give
no other Reaſon why Tincture of Antimony
ſhould, except it were an Acid, and therefore
concluded it was not an Alkaly; but to help
him over that difficulty, I ſhall tell him, that
whether that Acrimony, which cauſes Heat of
Urin, be corrected by Acids, or diſperſed
and carry'd off by Sweat upon the Uſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies,
it is all one, and ſince a Decoction of
Diaphoretick Wood will cure that Acrimony
as well as Diaphoretick Antimony, there is
the ſame Reaſon to be given for both, and as
Acids correct the Humour, and alter it, by
dulling and taking off the Edges of it; ſo
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103742:50"/>
Antimony carrys it off by Sweat, and the
Acrimony by being ſo diverted, the Symptom
ceaſes.</p>
                     <p>Page 125, He ſays, <hi>I have only brought my
Doctrin of Acids upon the Stage as a general
one in Oppoſition to the general and pernicious
Doctrin of Alkalies.</hi> A very fine Man truly,
and much to be admired! He aſſerts only for
the ſake of contradiction, and really in this
Point he ſpeaks Truth; for with what other
Deſign would he change the very Names of
Things, but to ſeem to differ from others, in
trivial Matters; for the Names of Things
are ſo indifferent, that it matters not what they
are called, ſo they have but a Name to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
them, and when he ſays Tincture of
Antimony will take off ſuch a heat of Urin,
whether the Name of it be Alkaly or Acid, it
matters not, if it were generally, as well as
all other things of the ſame Nature, known
by that Name, but when the Names of things
are given them, and generally received, it is
abſurd to alter them without Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>From Page 116, to 132, He heaps up a
parcel of incoherent Stories, of ſpecifick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines;
but to what end, except to fill up his
Book, I cannot imagin; for he neither gives
Reaſon for them, neither can they any ways
confirm the Truth of any thing he hath aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but, if to tell a Parcel of Tales is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to make a Man an Author, Old Women
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103742:50"/>
are fitter to write Books, then he, being ſtocked
with a greater Variety of Storys.</p>
                     <p>As for what he hath ſaid of the <hi>Cortex Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vianus,</hi>
I ſhall take another opportunity to
give my Thoughts of it, when I have time
to propoſe ſomething concerning the Reaſon of
Agues, and to examin what his worthy Friend
hath ſaid on this Subject.</p>
                     <p>But to Apologize for telling us all theſe
Stories, he furniſhes us with many more;
which may indeed be grounds for an excuſe
for him; if we would change that old Maxim
(which is all relating to the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
which he underſtands,) <hi>Nihil dat
quod in ſe non habet;</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> what can one
expect more in a Calves Head than Brains, or
as the <hi>Proverb</hi> uſually runs, what can one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
more of a Cat than her Skin.</p>
                     <p>Page 136, He ſays, that <hi>Acton, Epſom,
Dullage</hi> or <hi>Northall</hi> Waters, <hi>&amp;c. are allowed
to be Acids, and according to the Difference of
the Acid contained in them, they have different
Operations,</hi> but I muſt ask him, by whom
they are allowed to be ſo? By no Body that
I know of; for Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> hath extracted that
Salt and it appears to be ſo far from an Acid,
that it is evidently in Taſte a bitter pene trating
Salt, and I never heard that a bitter Salt could
be allowed to be an Acid, except Gall differed
not in Taſte from Sevil-Oranges.</p>

                  <p>THUS far I have ſhewed the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities
of what this Man deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and what little Reaſon he
hath, to be ſo inſolent, and ſaucy
with his Superiors, infinitely ſo in Knowledge
and Learning, as well as Fortune: But it is
but common for Fools to think themſelves Wiſe
Men; whereas wiſe Men are more ſubject to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

in Print, with that Impudence, which
is the only Support of Ignorance.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to examin his Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix

to this Eſſay, and all that I ſhall take
Notice of in his Preface to this, is, that he
ſays, <hi>I don't at all pretend to arrive at ſo much
certainty, as by the Methods I take, to make
People immortal, and that no Body ſhall die.</hi>
Here methinks he begins to be ſenſible of his
Weakneſs, and is conſcious, that he wants
to make an Apology for the frequent Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of his Patients; which Gueſs of mine
is confirmed by the large ſtrain of Divinity
that follows it. But to proceed;</p>
                  <p>The Pretence of this Appendix, is, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
and make his Terms Alkaly and Acid
more Intelligible, and to anſwer ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
made againſt his Eſſay: As for the
Terms, they have been explained ſufficiently
already, every Body knowing what is meant
by Alkaly, and what by Acids, and what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
are ranked under each; though ſome
Ignorant Men have miſuſed thoſe Words: But,
without doubt, to ſerve a Particular Turn,
we muſt expect from him, a Particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation.</p>
                  <p>But before he goes about his Explanation,
Page the 3, He ſays, <hi>I have not publiſhed the
Doctrin of Acids and Alkalies, out of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of appearing ſingular, or of being the Head
of a Faction, but out of mere pity and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Mankind, my fellow Creatures, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
Circumſtances under miſtaken Methods,
I have long bewailed, to ſee Phyſick made the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103742:54"/>
Scene of Slaughter,</hi> &amp;c. But if he does not
write out of a Deſign of being ſingular,
there is no ſuch thing as being ſingular; for
does he not cure ſome Diſtempers by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
that have been all along uſed in <hi>Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms,</hi>
and the <hi>Scurvey;</hi> and only varies from
others by a fooliſh Method, and boaſt of a
New one, and only, becauſe he hath changed
the Names of thoſe Medicines: But this is
done out of compaſſion to his Fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
pray, where ſies the Compaſſion?
Might not Steel and Antimony do as much
good, when called Alkalies as when called
Acids? Does changing Names alter the
Vertue? Or increaſe the Value of a Thing?
Is not a Dog as valuable or contemptible
equally, whether it be called a Dog or a
Horſe? But he ſaid a little before he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
this general Method, in Oppoſition
to Alkalies; but I'll aſſure him he hath not;
for though in the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> he hath altered
Dr. <hi>Sydenhams</hi> Practice abſurdly enough; yet
in the <hi>Scurvey, Rheumatiſm,</hi> &amp;c. he hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
altered the Names of ſome Medicines:
And come ſhort of others by the help of his
Ignorance, and yet bewails Phyſick to ſee it a
<hi>Scene of Slaughter;</hi> but if it was, it would
be ſo ſtill; will Steel or Antimony cure a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
nay and the ſame Diſtemper, better
for being called an Acid, than if it were an
Alkaly? and how can this Man with ſuch Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103742:55"/>
reproach Reaſon and Experience, and
tell the World, that they are ſent to their
Graves, by that which he in ſome Caſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
as well as he can, like a Man that
hath loſt his way by running into the Dark,
and only masks it, with a new Name.</p>
                  <p>Page the 4, and 5, He begins to explain
the Term Alkaly, and ſays; <hi>It derives it's
Name from the Herb</hi> Kaly, <hi>from the Aſhes of
which is extracted a large quantity of Salt, and
the Aſhes of moſt Herbs affording a Salt of the
ſame Nature with thoſe of the Herb</hi> Kaly <hi>are
equivocally called Alkalies, and all other things
of the ſame Nature, as Crabs-Eyes, Oyſter-Shells.</hi>
Now what he here ſays being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it is plain, that thoſe Medicines, that he
alters the Names of, and calls Acids, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
by this Rule of his own, to be called
Alkalies; they being of the Nature of Crabs-Eyes,
Oyſter-Shells; and that they are of
the Nature of Crabs-Eyes is very evident,
becauſe as Crabs-Eyes cure Acidity in the
Stomach, ſo do they, only more powerfully,
and alſo Acidities in the Blood; ſo that he
here undermines himſelf, and contradicts his
own Judgment, but it is a good while ſince
he wrote the laſt, and his treacherous Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as he calls it, is to be blamed; but yet
one would think that the ſame that is Truth
now, would have been ſo then, when he thought
of the ſame Matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:103742:55"/>
Page the 6, He ſuppoſes <hi>Acid to be derived
from the</hi> Arabian <hi>Word Acaid, which ſignifies
Acetum.</hi> Upon my word a mighty profound
Schollar! He underſtands no leſs than a whole
Word of <hi>Arabick,</hi> and it's a wonder he
did not write his whole Book in it; but leſt
he ſhould be too proud of himſelf, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
himſelf too much upon this mighty Piece
of Scholarſhip; I ſhall do him a kindneſs,
as to keep his Stomach from riſing, and tell
him; that Vinegar or <hi>Acetum</hi> is not Acid,
but Acrid, and had he underſtood one word
of <hi>Latin,</hi> along with his <hi>Arabian</hi> Word, he
would have found that Vinegar takes it's
Name from <hi>Vinum Acre,</hi> or ſharp Wine, and
that Acrimony is derived from <hi>Acre;</hi> ſo that
he is miſtaken if he calls thoſe things that are
like Vinegar, Acid; for they are Acrid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And,</p>
                  <p>As for Fruits and the Natural Juices of
Plants, there are but very few Acid Ones,
like Acrid except that ſweet be like bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Page 7. <hi>All metaline Sulphurs are to be
ranged amongſt the Number of Acids.</hi> But if
we compare the Effects of Sulphur, with the
Effects of Acids, there is ſo little Reaſon to
call Sulphur Acid, that Acid is as like Alkaly;
as Sulphur, is like Acid, the Effects being
quite contrary; for whereas Acid cools
and abates the Heat of the Blood, Sulphur
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103742:56"/>
exalts and encreaſes it; ſo that Sulphur is a
Body of as diſtinct a Nature from Acid, as
Bitter and Sowre.</p>
                  <p>But to what purpoſe would it be to reaſon
with a Man, who calls Oyls and Balſoms
and Bread Acids; ſince any Body that can
Taſte, will tell, that Balſam hath a different
taſte from Juice of Lemmons. And one might
as well ſay, Iron is Wood, becauſe one may

becauſe an Acid Spirit be made of Part of

                  <p>Page the <hi>10th.</hi> in order to a well Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of I know not what, he begins to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<hi>Sal Kaly,</hi> as he calls it, with Vinegar, and
here Page 11 and 12, he takes care to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a miſchievous ſort of Alkaly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
the whole Claſs of Alkalies, which is
never at all uſed in Phyſick; and takes no
notice of all thoſe Alkalies, as Steel, Antimony,
Cinnaber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with many more, which are the
beſt and moſt valuable Medicines ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Nature or Art, for their univerſal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in Phyſick; and then he ſays, Alkalies
<hi>by breaking the Globules of the Blood, cauſe
Scurvey, Rheumatiſms, Gout, &amp;c.</hi> whereas, before
in his Eſſay, he told us, that the Coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Blood in theſe Diſtempers procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from Alkalies Coagulating thoſe Acids,
which were taken into the Blood? But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
Forgetfulneſs, and Miſtakes are ſo
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103742:56"/>
Natural to him, that he muſt not be blamed
poor Man! That this is a Miſtake of the firſt
Magnitude is as plain, as that Coagulation
and Diſſolution, two Oppoſites, can make
it.</p>
                  <p>Having thus repreſented Alkalies from
Page the 12, to Page 17, he takes all the care
he can, to repreſent Acids with all poſſible Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
by Vinegar, of which he takes care
to ſay all the Good he can, but not a word
of the Miſchief it does, to Scorbuticks, Phthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks,
and ſore Throats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that if we rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
up but what Miſchief Vinegar might do,
if it were made ill uſe of, they would out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
all the Good, and more than the ill
Effects of Alkalies do their Good ones.</p>
                  <p>But now he hath made his Compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Alkaly, and Acid, I might take the ſame
Liberty, and compare the beſt of Alkalies
with the worſt of Acids; which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
his Acids worſe than he can do Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
but we are not to judge of any thing, by
the ill Uſe that may be made of it, but by the
good Effects; and every thing is valuable for
the Good which it does, though in different
caſes; and by the ſame Method he takes to
perſwade People from uſing Alkalies, we might
perſwade People from the Uſe of Fire;
for it will burn and cauſe ill Effects, worſe
than the <hi>Sal Kaly;</hi> yet if moderately, is almoſt
of univerſal Uſe: So that though <hi>Sal Kaly</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:103742:57"/>
ſhould have ſuch Effects, there are a great
many Alkalies; as Steel, Crabs-Eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
do as much Good.</p>
                  <p>But by the Method he takes, Chriſtians
would be repreſented worſe than Heathens, for
if he ſhould compare <hi>Seneca</hi> with a Chriſtian
who is a Thief, a Murderer, and the worſt of
Men; how odiouſly muſt Chriſtians be, if all
were to be judged, by that one; but what
Ill will not a Man do to carry on a bad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign?</p>
                  <p>From Page the 17, to the 21, he reckons up
all the ill Effects he can of Arſnick, as an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly,
but what poyſonons Deſign he hath in
it, he beſt knows; for this can ſignifie nothing
to the crying down of Alkalies, though it
were Alkaly, ſince none are ſo wicked, as to
give, ſuch without a Deſign to poyſon People.</p>
                  <p>But ſince he thinks it a way to cry down
Alkaly, by ſhewing that Arſnick is an Alkaly
I ſhall hear only two Witneſſes againſt him,
who writ long before his ſimple Books were
writ, to prove that it is a dangerous, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Acid.</p>
                  <p>And firſt the Ingenious Sir <hi>John Floyer,</hi> in
the firſt of his <gap reason="foreign">

and is compounded like it of an Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
part (which in <hi>Arſnick</hi> is more peircing)
and an Acid.</q> And again Page 231, of
the ſecond Part. <q>

and Acids.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Secondly, the Famous <hi>Ettmuller</hi> in his
<hi>Schroderi dilucidati Mineralogia</hi> ſays, <q>

Arſnic,</hi> which is really a <hi>Volatile
mineral Sulphur,</hi> and exalted by <hi>Sublimation.
Arſnic</hi> is truly called by the Author, a kind
of mineral ſoot, fat and inflamable; for it
is really a moſt <hi>Volatile Sulphur,</hi> and by
it's <hi>Volatility</hi> very corroſive and a ſtrong Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</q>
Now by the former of theſe Authors
it is aſſerted to be an Oyly Acid, and by the
latter, who was a profound Judicious Man, it
is affirmed for the moſt Part to be a <hi>Mineral
Sulphur;</hi> from which two, according to Page
the 7. of his own Appendix, it is proved to
be an Acid; becauſe he there Claſſes all Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſams
and Sulphurs amongſt Acids; ſo that all
the Prejudice that a Sublimed Acid can do,
may be done by Mr. <hi>John Colbatch</hi> his
Acid.</p>
                  <p>From Page the 21, to the 25. He reckons
up all the good Effects of Oyl of Vitriol;
but mentions not the Miſchief, that might be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103742:58"/>
done with it, which is a great deal more, for
it corrodes and eats away the Fleſh, cauſes an
intolerable Heat.</p>
                  <p>Page the 28, He ſays <hi>As for Balſams if I
ſhould take upon me to deſcribe their Excellencies,
it would be fitter for a Volum than an Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix;</hi>
but if he had caſt out a great deal of
his ſtuff, that he hath put in, and which was
brought in by the Head and Shoulders, and
hath no Relation to his Diſcourſe, only to fill
it up, he might have had room enough for
Balſams, which makes me believe he had very
little towards a great Volum.</p>
                  <p>From Page the 39, to 71. He lays down
ſeveral Objections, to ſhew, that he cannot
Anſwer them; and that it may appear, he
hath not done it, I ſhall take notice of them
in that Order, he has laid them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Objection is <q>how comes it to
paſs thoſe People that live upon nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
but highly Salted Meat, are more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the <hi>Scurvey.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To this he Anſwers,</hi> That it is not becauſe
they eat more Salt, but becauſe they eat more
Fleſh than other People, which abounds with
Alkalious Particles, and as for the Sea Salt is
moſt carried off by Urin.</p>
                  <p>But to this I anſwer, that if it were not
the Acid Sea Salt, then freſh Beef would
ſooner create the Scurvey than Salt; becauſe
according to him, it being Alkalious altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103742:58"/>
and not being tempered with the Sea
Salt, it would increaſe the Alkalies of the
Blood I think more; But, for my Part, I am
ſure Beef is nothing like an Alkaly, (for as
much as I, and all the World beſides, can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,)
it abounding with a ſweet Balſamick
Juice, the Maſs of Blood; but that Maſs of
Blood abounds with Alkaly, he'll ſay; but
then he muſt remember what he ſaid the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Page of his Appendix, <hi>viz.</hi> that all ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginous
Balſamicks are to be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Acids, and then it will follow that the
Taſte of the Blood being ſweet and Balſamic,
it muſt be reckoned amongſt Acids, ſo that
our Quick-ſighted Reformer of Phyſick, hath
once more contradicted himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe Beef to be Alkaly, it will be
no more for his purpoſe, becauſe Page 59, of
his Eſſay he ſays, that a Mixture of Acids with
Alkaly cauſes a Coagulation; ſo that Acid
and Alkaly thus carried into the Blood to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
muſt thicken the Blood; but then,
that this Diſtemper may by all means proceed
from Alkaly, he will ſuppoſe the Accid to run
off by Urin; ſtil he is never the better; for
in that ſame Page of his Eſſay, it appears,
that as long as the Alkaly is not mixed with
Acid, there is no Coagulation, till it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
by drinking Wine; from whence
it appears, that if the Acid were ſo carryed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103742:59"/>
off, there would be no ſuch Coagulation in
Scrobutic Serum.</p>
                  <p>Having ſhewn how he contradicts himſelf
backwards and forwards, in Anſwer to this
firſt Objection, I ſhall paſs to the ſecond;</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Objection is, <q>how it comes
to paſs, that when the Stomach abounds
with Acids, the Blood does not. </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He Anſwers, <hi>The meat we eat being diſſolved
by a Spirituous Acid Juice, it is turned into a
Subſtance for the Nutrition of our Bodies, and
that this, in People that live a Sedentary Life,
lying too long in the Stomach, is turned Acid:</hi>
But this is no Anſwer to the Queſtion; it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tells us, how the Stomach becomes full of
Acids; but how comes it to paſs then, that
when the Stomach is emptyed of this Acid
ſtuff; part of it is not ſqueezed through the
Lacteals into the Blood? Truly he can give
no Reaſon for it; ſo that the Blood muſt
needs, according to the courſe and tendency of
Chyle, be tainted with that Acidity.</p>
                  <p>The third Objection is, <q>That this Acid
being kept from going into the Blood
would, according to him, prevent Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He Anſwers, That</hi> People who are troubled
with Acidity in their Stomach, make great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Water, are very lean and coſtive, which
he will prove to be, becauſe Acids are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into the Blood. And firſt when we make
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103742:59"/>
Water, much, the attenuated <hi>Chyle</hi> runs off by
Veſſels, which carry it from the Stomach to
the Kidneys through the <hi>Omentum,</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
it from going into the Blood. <hi>And from
Page 39, to the 40, he would ſuggeſt,</hi> that
there are ſuch Veſſels for it to paſs off by. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
the Reaſon why People are ſo lean, is,
becauſe the Acid <hi>Chyle</hi> ſo diluted is carried off,
and the Oyly Particles of the Blood want Acid
to thicken them, and to turn them into Fat.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Reaſon why they are coſtive, is,
becauſe, ſo much Moiſture turning off by Urin
the excrements are hardned, and the Guts want
Moiſture to Lubricate them.</p>
                  <p>To this Objection he gives no direct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
no not ſo much as a falſe one; for
what he offers for an Anſwer, is ſo far from
being one, that it has not the leaſt Relation
to the Objection, as he explains it; for the
Objection relates to Diſtempers in the Blood;
whereas, as he explains thoſe three <hi>Phaenomena,</hi>
they are not Diſtempers of the Blood; for he
makes Acidity in the Stomach, the Cauſe of
too much Urin, and of Coſtiveneſs; and as
for Leanneſs, the more Oyly and Sulphureous
the Blood is, the Fatter is the Body; and
according to him, in the beginning of this
Appendix, Page the <hi>7th,</hi> the more Acid it is,
and conſequently cannot find any Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
by his new Reaſon of making too much
Water; for though the Acids run off by Urin
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103742:60"/>
and never come into the Blood, yet ſince the
Blood abounds with Fat Particles, accod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him it would not want Acids.</p>
                  <p>But as I have often taken notice of him
already, ſo I may ſtill, that Contradictions
and Incoherency are natural to him, and
we may expect nothing elſe from him; but
I ſhall not only ſhew, how that his Anſwer is
not direct to the Objection; but that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
thoſe Symptoms he mentions very
falſely.</p>
                  <p>And firſt the Reaſon, why People who have
Acidity on their Stomachs, make much
Water, cannot be, becauſe, the Acid Chyle
is carried off, by ſuch Paſſages, as he ſuppoſes,
becauſe there are no ſuch Paſſages, to be
diſcovered; for not all the Anatomiſts, nor
Glaſſes, could ever as yet diſcern the leaſt
Foot-ſteps of them; and if there were ſuch
Veſſels, as he ſuppoſes, to convey ſo much
Urin into the Bladder; they muſt be of a
conſiderable ſize; but ſhould we ſuppoſe ſuch
Veſſels, I am affraid he would ſcarce explain
how Acid Chyle comes to be Lixivious, and
to have an Urinous Taſte barely by running
through a ſhort Veſſel; for Urin and Chyle
are Bodies ſo diſtinct from one another, that
ſuch a Conveyance would ſcarce turn the Acid
Chyle into Urin, but that People whoſe Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs
abound with Acids, make much Urin,
ſhews that this Acid is really carryed into the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103742:60"/>
Blood; for the Chyle being tainted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with this Acidity, as ſoon as it
comes into the Blood, the Acidity preſently
precipitates the watry Part of the Serum,
which is the Reaſon, they make ſo much Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
clear Water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for his Reaſon, why ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are lean, this is as unlikely as the former;
for how can we think that Chyle is carried off,
ſince ſuch Peoples Urin is as clear as Water,
whereas, if what he ſays were true, it muſt
be as thick as Milk; but this he hath bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> his Reaſon of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abetes,</hi>
only he lept upon it, and forgot
where he found it; and alſo what Uſe to make
of it; but perhaps I wrong him, it may be
he'll ſay he did not read Dr. <hi>Willis;</hi> ſhould
he give me that Anſwer, I could almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, and then I ſhould think, that ſome
Body had told him the Reaſon of a <hi>Diabetes,</hi>
and that upon ſuch a Deep hint as that, he
framed this wonderful Hypothetical Nonſence.</p>
                  <p>That ſuch Peoples Blood does not want
Acids, I have already ſhewed, and that what
he ſays is falſe, were he to be judged by this
<hi>7th,</hi> Page of his own Book, but Juſtice hath
not always thought fit, that a Man's own
Confeſſion ſhould be evidence againſt him,
except at his Tryal; and therefore I ſhall
ſhew him that Leanneſs does not follow for
want of that Acid; but is cauſed by the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103742:61"/>
Blood being too much impregnated with it;
For the Fat of an Animal is not a Concrete
of Oyl, and ſuch a crude Acid, as that
which abounds in diſtempered Peoples
Stomachs, is the common Obſervation, and
Suffrage of Learned Men; but from a more
Nitrous and Spirituous one; for that Acid is
ſo far from being a Part of Fat, that nothing
more powerfully checks the Preter-natural
Fermentation of the Blood, than Acids; and
the more the Blood abounds with Acids, the
more it's Sulphur is depreſſed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cannot yield Oyly Parts, for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
of Fat; ſince it ſcarce ſupplies Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with ſufficient Refreſhment. Beſides, this
Acid, which he ſuppoſes would cauſe the
Chyle to run off by Urin, through ſome
private Ducts, would have the ſame Effects
in the Blood, and by that means cauſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<hi>Diabetes,</hi> by forcing away the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Juice along with it.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Reaſon he gives, why ſuch
People are coſtive, is alſo falſe; for, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines
don't ſo much want Moiſture, as
ſomething to raiſe the Periſtaltick Motion
ſufficiently, and by irritating their Nervous
Coat to put the Muſculous Parts into
a ſtronger <hi>Nixus;</hi> for when Acids too
much abound, the Ferment that is laid
down by the <hi>Ductus Colidocus,</hi> is always too
ſmall in Quantity, or elſe too mild in Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103742:61"/>
and the Reaſon why they are coſtive is,
becauſe they have too little Choler, and that
too, is temper'd and depreſſed by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-natural
Acidity of the Stomach, and Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatic
Juice, ſo that the Inteſtins want their
natural <hi>Stimulus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Objection he pretends to Anſwer
is, <q>why, if Acids cauſe ſuch a diſſolution
of the Chyle, Steel does not alſo make
it run off by Urin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Anſwer he gives to this, is, that</hi> Iron
cannot be conveyed into the Blood, before it be
turned into a Vitriol.</p>
                  <p>But to this, I anſwer, that the Attenuation
of the Chyle, he ſuppoſed juſt before, was in
the Stomach, and that it was conveighed
through Veſſels from thence to the Kidneys;
but here he hath forgot, what he had before
ſaid: and like one that had neither Memory
nor Knowledge, but always talked, like a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot,
what was next his Tongue, and what was
immediately in the View of his Fancy, without
conſidering what it was; but ſuppoſing Steel
to be an Acid, I don't then ſee what difference
there is betwixt the effects it would have to
his Advantage, though altered, as he ſays, in
the Stomach; for Vitriol is an Acid and a very
ſtrong one; ſo that if Steel would have ſuch
ill Effects, if Acid, he, inſtead of Anſwering
the Objection, and removing the Difficulty,
makes it ſtronger againſt himſelf; for by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103742:62"/>
turned into a Vitriol it would be a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Acid, and conſequently do more Miſchief
by being ſo changed; But I have before ſhewn,
that he is miſtaken; for Steel is not an Acid but
an Alkaly, and the good effects it hath are
by abſorbing the Acidities of the Pancreatick
Juice.</p>
                  <p>And now having gone through his Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix
thus far, and ſhewed the Inconſiſtency of
this Part of his Book, with what had gone
before; and alſo, how he is incoherent and
miſtaken throughout the whole, I come next
to examin two or three Caſes which he
brings to cloſe up his Book; as to the truth of
the Cures we have Reaſon to ſuſpect him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already aſſured, that he will tell the
World he cures, tho' thoſe ſame Perſons dyed;
which we have ſufficient Inſtances of in his
<hi>Novum Lumen Chirurgicum:</hi> But as to that
Point, one that will tell Lyes, may ſay what
he will, yet People know how to truſt him;
and therefore, I ſhall examin the nature of
thoſe Medicines, and ſhew, that he is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
and that thoſe he cured, he did not
know how, for he ſays he cured them with
Acids; but the Nature of thoſe Medicines is
ſo far from Acidity, that they are quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
and appear to be what he ſo much
rails at, <hi>viz.</hi> Alkalies; or other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103742:62"/>
which are generally uſed to deſtroy
Acids.</p>
                  <p>The Medicines mentioned in the firſt Caſe
are, <hi>Cinnaber</hi> of <hi>Antimony, Gum Gujaci.
Bad. Bardan. Sem. Bardan. Fraxin. Bacc.
Junip. Saſſafras. Tartar. Vitriolat.</hi> as for the
firſt, <hi>viz. Cinnaber</hi> it is by all the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
World and the moſt eminent Writers
found to be of Uſe, where the Blood and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
have a manifeſt Viſcidity; and it is by
Experience found to take off ſuch Viſcidity,
which is cauſed by Acids; but this Learned
Loger-head hath the confidence to think, that
the World will be impoſed upon, and believe
him before Men of Senſe and Learning, who
could have no Prejudice to him, nor did not
do it to oppoſe him, they having given the
World an Account of what it was, before he
was old enough to underſtand them, or knew
what it was to go to School. And as for
the reſt, they ſo far differ from Acids, that
they manifeſtly taſte Oyly, Sweet, and are
Odoriferous; and ſince I write this for thoſe
that do not underſtand, whether he writes Lies
or Truth, I ſhall tell them, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Names
of thoſe Medicines, and then let them taſte
Sevil-Oranges, and ſee, whether Juniper
Berries, Burdock and Aſh Seeds or Saſſafras,
which almoſt taſtes like Mace, be of the
ſame Taſte with thoſe Oranges; the ſame
Method they may take with all the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103742:63"/>
Medicines he uſes; and if they find Juniper
Berries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> taſte like Oranges, then Mr.
<hi>John Colbatch</hi> is in the right, otherwiſe they
know he is miſtaken. But the laſt Medicine
he mentions is <hi>Tartar. Vitriolat.</hi> but there
is ſo little in that Medicin of it, and the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it will be ſo ſmall, that it is not much
matter whether it be Alkaly or Acid.</p>
                  <p>In his <hi>Third</hi> Caſe, for Convulſions he gives
Vitriolated <hi>Tartar. Crem. Tartar.</hi> and <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
Ag. Paeon. Roriſmarin.</hi> and <hi>Puleg.</hi> all of
which are known to be Abſorbers of Acids, and
Correcters of them, except the two firſt; for
they manifeſtly abound with a Volatile and
Spirituous Oyl; and if the two former were
Acids, yet the latter being of a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Nature, and more in Quantity, all that
can be ſaid of this Medicine is, that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did good nor harm, the one part of it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
the other, and obſtructing the Force
of it, and it was all one, as if one ſhould mix
hot and cold Water together to cool ones thirſt,
and if that Patient recovered, it was not to be
aſcribed to the Vertue of his Medicine, but
the Mildneſs of the Cauſe of that Diſtemper;
which would have gone off as ſoon without
it.</p>
                  <p>The remaining Pages of this Book are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up with a Catalogue of Diſtempers ſent to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103742:63"/>
him by Dr. <hi>Jones</hi> (who, becauſe <hi>Colbatch</hi>
hath Impoſed upon ſome part of the Kingdom,
would needs be ſeen in ſo Meritorious a Cauſe;
but what will not ſome Men do, when
they value a private Deſign before Truth
and Honeſty,) and an Account of the Uſe
of Beverage at Sea; but this being not at all
to the purpoſe, but to fill up his Book.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only further take notice, That Pag.
the <hi>86th.</hi> He ſays, <hi>he could never hear, that
the Peruvian Bark cured one Conſumption, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from Apothecarys nor Phiſicians,</hi> but I can
tell him, that I knew more than one cured of
a very Violent Hectick Fever, only by the
Uſe of that Bark, and Balſamick Syrup in
which it was given, and a Compoſition of
<hi>Laudanum Pil. de Styrace,</hi> with <hi>Safron;</hi>
which the Learned Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> hath in this
<hi>Phythiologia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having hitherto travailed through Clouds,
Ignorance and Absurdities, through Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
Miſtakes and Forgetfulneſs, through
an indigeſted Maſs and a confuſed <hi>Congeries</hi>
of incoherent Rubbiſh; which, though it is
nauſeous, yet I ſhall not think a little time
ill ſpent, to undeceive the World, from ſuch
a vain pretending Impoſtor; that knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Nonſenſe, and who, and whoſe ſole
Support, is Impudence and Boldneſs. All
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103742:64"/>
that I have now to do is to examin his
Treatiſe of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and to ſhew what Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities
and Miſtakes he is guilty of there,
and the ill Conſequences of his Erroneous
Practice.</p>

                     <head type="sub">In which are contained Remarks on his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
and Preface with an Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to Dr. Cole.</head>
                     <p>THE next and laſt Part of this
nauſeous Task, that I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
is, to examin and lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the Miſtakes of his Book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Gout;</hi> but before I ſet about that,
there are two Things which lie in my way,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103742:66"/>
and which I muſt take notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
and a <hi>Preface.</hi> The firſt thing I ſhall
take a View of, is, his <hi>Dedication</hi> where he
begins and ſays;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Love to Truth and the Good and Welfare
of Mankind, have ingaged me in Publiſhing of
the following Piece.</hi> But however ſpecious
this Pretence is, it appears, that it is not for
the Good nor Welfare of Mankind; but on
the contrary, will tend to their great Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the Ruin of their Conſtitutions; ſince
it will eaſily appear, that it is made up of
the ſame Materials that the reſt of his Books
are, <hi>viz.</hi> notorious Miſtakes and Blunders,
and ſuch plain ones too, that one can ſcarce
think, but that he was either conſcious of
them or very ignorant; But as I would not
have him thought to be quite ſo ignorant; ſo
I rather think, that he was conſcious of the
Falſneſs of what he aſſerted, and only did it
with a Deſign to get a Reputation amongſt the
Injudicious, which he deſigned to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
how much ſoever he expoſed himſelf,
to the Ridicule and Contempt of the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Learned, by his weak and inconſiſtent
Falſities.</p>
                     <p>And truly, thus far he is in the right, <hi>It
wants a much better Champion</hi> (tho' he's pleaſed
to call himſelf a Champion) <hi>to aſſert and
defend a falſe Cauſe againſt ſo many Potent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,</hi>
who have Truth on their ſide; for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103742:66"/>
were he in the right, all that could be ſaid of
his Book is, that he is dully and fooliſhly in
the Right; but ſince it will preſently appear,
that he is ſo much miſtaken; he is much leſs
to be valued, for daring and endeavouring to
impoſe on the World.</p>
                     <p>But the remaining Part of his <hi>Dedication,</hi>
being moſt of it a Compliment to Dr. <hi>Cole,</hi>
which were it true would but ſorrily recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> to the Learned World: I ſhall
make <hi>Remarks</hi> on what follows, and then
make my <hi>Apology</hi> to Dr. <hi>Cole,</hi> for preſuming
to ſhew the Abſurdities of a Book, which
the Author tells the World, tho' I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
falſly, is agreeable with his Practice;
The Compliment beſtowed on Dr. <hi>Cole,</hi>
is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I preſume to prefix your Name before it,
knowing, that if you but pleaſe to eſpouſe it, my
Buſineſs is done and the Conqueſt gained:</hi> But I
dare venture to ſay, that though Dr. <hi>Cole</hi>
ſhould eſpouſe his Cauſe, which I believe he
will not, the Victory would not be gained;
ſince the Cauſe hath neither Truth nor Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

Reaſons, make a ſhort Apology to Dr, <hi>Cole.</hi>

                              <salute>Learned Sir,</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>IT is now almoſt a Year and half ago,
ſince I was brought into your Company
by a very Ingenious and Experienc'd Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon,
Mr. <hi>Geeke,</hi> living in <hi>Saliſbury-Court:</hi>
And Sir, that Civility you were pleaſed to
ſhew me, and the Freedom you took in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
with me, who was both a Stranger, and ſo
much Inferior to your ſelf, both in Learning
and Judgment, as well as Reputation, gave me
Reaſon to entertain ſuch Thoughts of you,
as, I believe, one of your Years and Character
might deſerve: And truly I had ſuch an
Opinion of you, that I could not then ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
that you would ever be concerned in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronizing
of a Book, that is not only Falſe and
Abſurd, but Weak and Inconſiſtent, and not
only ſo, but rudely contradictory to all Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men, whoſe private Deſigns do not byaſs
their Sentiments; and what is more, without
any ſhew of Reaſon, or appearance of Truth.</p>
                           <p>And I could rather have believed that you
would not be concerned, in ſuch a Cauſe,
for this Reaſon; becauſe it is below any Man
of Senſe or Learning, to appear at the
Head of ſuch a Cauſe, which is againſt
both.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="113" facs="tcp:103742:67"/>
And I fain would have ſuch Thoughts of
you ſtill, and conclude, that you only did
it to ſatisfy the Importunities of one, that
had been formerly your <hi>Apothecary</hi> in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This Sir, is the Interpretation I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
put upon it, in Favour of your Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which muſt needs be leſſened other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
eſpecially amongſt the Learned, by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronizing
any thing which directly and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
is repugnant to Learned Men and Truth;
ſince the common Intereſt of the former, ſo
far as it is conſiſtent with the latter, ſhould
incline you rather to defend both, than Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize
their Opponents, <hi>viz.</hi> Ignorance and
Falſity; upon any conſideration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                           <p>This, I ſay, is the Interpretation I ſhould
put upon it (though if it were ſo, it would
not be blameleſs to oppoſe Truth and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men, to ſerve a Friend or your Self)
were there not ſomething in that Dedication,
ſo plain and evident, as to ſuggeſt ſome other
Reaſon for your Patronage.</p>
                           <p>For Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> ſays, the Doctrin ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in his Book, is not new to you, it
being what you long ago Practiſed, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he knew you, how he came to know
what your Practice was before he knew you,
looks to me like Contradiction, and I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to believe he ſtrained to ſay ſo much
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103742:68"/>
beyond Truth, only that your Name might
the better recommend his Book; ſo that it
ſeems, if your Name will ſerve him by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Authority to his Book, he'll tell an
Untruth to ſerve you; ſo that I am apt yet in
Favour of your Reputation, to underſtand,
that you have permitted him to ſay, it is your
Practice, to recommend it to the World,
that his Applauſe of you might go the farther.</p>
                           <p>And the Truth is this, either your Practice
agrees with what he ſays, or you can make no
good Excuſe for permitting him to ſay ſo.</p>
                           <p>And truly Sir, if what he ſays be not true,
you'd do your ſelf Juſtice to tell the World, in
Vindication of your Judgment and Practice, that
he hath impoſed upon you; but if you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
what he hath ſaid, I am ſorry the Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
and Falſneſs of his Book obliges me to
lay open the groundleſs and unreaſonable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions
there laid down; becauſe they
are, tho' falſely ſaid to be, ſo agreeable with
your Practice.</p>
                           <p>But in this particular, I muſt beg your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
for as I ſhall never write for the ſake of
Writing, but Truth; ſo I ſhall always endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to detect Falſities, and vindicate the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
And though I ſhall ever have all that
Reſpect for you, and all Learned Men, that I
think due to Learning and Qualities, ſo I
muſt ever ſhew as little Reſpect to thoſe,
that make it their Buſineſs to run down Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103742:68"/>
Learned Men, and Truth, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reaſon, tho' not ſome baſe and private
End, for tho' I have Learning or Knowledg
little enough, to make me ſo zealous in their
Defence, yet I ſhall ever think it worth my
while to Defend that, which I am willing to
ſpend my time in the ſearch of.</p>
                           <p>And were I in your Caſe, I ſhould never
condeſcend ſo far, as for Intereſt, to Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
that, which I could give no Reaſon for.
But,</p>
                           <p>Sir, The ſimplicity and falſneſs of his other
Books, I have already ſhewn, and when I
have laid open this, I hope the World will
ſee the ſhallowneſs of Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> and the
Falſneſs of what he ſays, ſo plainly, that it
will be no longer miſled by him, in a
Matter that relates to the future Ruin of
their Conſtitutions.</p>
                           <p>And Sir, it, at the beſt, will be but little
Credit to profeſs your ſelf of the ſame Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> an Apothecary, and
much leſs is it Honourable, to joyn in a
Cauſe with ſuch a one, that hath neither
Knowledg nor Learning, but Arrogancy
and Boldneſs to ſupport his Ignorance; and
to forſake the Cauſe of Truth and Learning to
make a Party with ſuch.</p>
                           <p>For all the Cry and Noiſe he can make of
you, will tend leſs to your Honour, than
your Reputation amongſt Learned Men; tho'
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103742:69"/>
it may help to captivate thoſe who are eaſily
deceived.</p>
                           <p>But Sir, as I had formerly a great Opinion
of your Merit; ſo I would fain perſwade my
ſelf ſtill, that you only permit him to ſay,
what he does, in compliance with his too
earneſt Requeſts, than any Opinion you have
of the Truth of what he ſays, and therefore
when I have run over his Preface without any
other Apologies, I ſhall proceed to detect his
Errors, and ſhew the Falſneſs of what he
there aſſerts, without entituling you to ſo
weak and open Errors; and profeſs my ſelf as
ever,</p>
                           <closer>
                              <signed>Your very Humble Servant R. Boulton.</signed>

                     </floatingText>
                     <p>The next thing that comes in view after
his Dedication is his Preface; where Page the
<hi>11th</hi> he ſays, <hi>The Hiſtory of the Blood is to be
fetched out of the Fire, there being not one Page
in it, that does not coſt me near a days Labour
and Attendance at home in my Laboratory.</hi> That
he fetches it out of the fire, I am afraid is
ominous; and that it will ſcarce be fit for
any thing elſe, but to return to that Element;
for there is ſo little Analogy betwixt Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103742:69"/>
Preparations, and the Parts of a Mans
Body, that he'll diſcover little to the purpoſe
there, to make the Uſe of them more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible;
and ſorry I am, he takes ſo much
Pains to no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Page the 12 He ſays, <hi>The following Piece is
a Compoſition of Obſervations and Speculations
at Coffee-Houſes, and ſuch Places.</hi> A very
fit Place for ſuch Compoſitions; for any thing
may ſerve for a News-Houſe, for want of
better; but it would have been better for him,
to have conſidered it at home in his Study;
for I am afraid he drank his Coffee ſo hot,
that he was ſcarce qualified for what my
Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſays, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>That a cool Head is
fitteſt for Conſideration.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But how came he to take Obſervations of
the Gout in Coffee-Houſes? Thoſe I thought
had been only to be made with his Patients;
but perhaps he had as many Patients there,
of that Diſtemper, as any where elſe; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
it might be as fit a Place to make
Obſervations in.</p>
                     <p>But why not rather in his Study? I
warrant he had taken notice, that the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore</hi> had writ his Heroic
Poems in Coffee-Houſes, and ſuch like Places;
and becauſe he thought it ſounded well to
ſay ſo, he muſt needs be a Wit too; nay in
time he may do well; but I would have him
think of the old Saying, <hi>Noſce teipſum;</hi> for
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103742:70"/>
if he were ſenſible of his own Weakneſs, it
would be better for him to take a private
Thought at it, if he knows how to think.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame Page, He ſays, <hi>the Expence of
his Experiments is ſo chargable, that it would
be fitter to be carryed on at the Expence of the
Nation.</hi> Nay, and he ſtates the Charge too,
a Thouſand Pound a Year would not be felt
by the Nation: O! what a mighty Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor?
He has a Thought as extenſive as the
Nation; 'tis a Wonder he is not ſent for to
Court, he'd put them upon Ways and
Means with a Witneſs, if not to raiſe Money,
yet to lay it out. But O! Vanity of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
verily every thing in Mr. <hi>John Colbatch</hi>
is Vanity; No leſs than a Thouſand a Year
muſt be ſpent upon Experiments, made by a
Man, who hath neither Diſcretion nor Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to make them, nor Philoſophy to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
him how to make, and how to apply,
them; Truly it is a Wonder, and a great one
too, that the Nation does not take Notice of
him; for he would be a mighty Jeſt were he
known to the bottom.</p>
                     <p>Pag. <hi>xvth.</hi> He ſays, <hi>we do now grope moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
in the dark, and it grieves me to the
very Soul, when I ſee People in Diſtreſs, and
know not how to help them.</hi> Poor Soul! But
I hope he hath a Cordial, and a moſt noble
Acid by him, to take a Lick of now and
then, or elſe he might pine away; for he looks
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103742:70"/>
very thin; and what muſt then become of
all thoſe Angelic Faces, that brought ſuch a
mighty Qualm over his Stomach, in the
Small-Pox; Ah! Beauty and Diſtreſs are two
great Cauſes of his Grief; but I believe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is the Root of all the Evil. Really, if
turning his Books would do good, poor Man!
though he does not underſtand them, he'd
never ceaſe to do it; but it hath proved in
vain, and now he confeſſes himſelf ignorant;
and truly, I think not without reaſon, for
through all his Books, I have yet examined,
he hath groped ſo miſerably in the dark,
that I had ſometimes much ado to find
where he was, or what Cloud he was
loſt in, he was ſo far from Truth, and the
Light which ought to be in his Expreſſions;
but (God be thanked) he's come to Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
at the laſt; but his Misfortune is, that
glimmering Light has led him into a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
where he is no better then in the dark,
having loſt his Way in Experiments, that he
miſapplies and makes bad Uſe of, becauſe he
does not underſtand them. But why muſt
it be, we grope in the dark? Is Mr. <hi>John Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
more then one, or does he ſpeak for
his Companions? As for rational Phyſicians,
they are not ſo miſerably in the dark, but
that they have Reaſon for what they do,
and know what to do, tho' Diſtempers are
ſometimes ſo violent, as not to yeild to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103742:71"/>
Medicines. But well may Apothecaries
grope in the dark, when they pretend to
things they don't underſtand, ſince even in
the Light they miſtake their Way moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pag. xvi. He ſays,</hi> He hath grounded his
<hi>Hypotheſis</hi> upon plain Experiments, and he
expects an Anſwer ſhould be backed with Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments.
<hi>And ſo far I ſhall ſatisfy his Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
by and by.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pag. xvi. He ſays, <hi>he remembers he ſaid in
his Eſſay of Alkalies, he had not had many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
and really the Number has not been
much increaſed yet;</hi> what little Reaſon then
hath he to write upon a Subject; where, were
what he ſays true, as to his Pretenſions in
the Cure of Diſtempers, general Rules are
not to be made by a particular Conſtitution;
but ſince what he ſays is falſe, he had much
leſs Reaſon to be ſo bold; and it is but
a ſorry Recommendation to his Book,
that he grounded it upon ſuch ſmall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>Pag. xvii. <hi>If People are once ſatisfy'd, that
the Bloods abounding with Alkalious Particles is
the Cauſe of the Gout and other Diſtempers, it
neceſſarily follows, that Acids are only proper to
correct the ſaid Alkaline Particles.</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Pag. xviii. He ſays, <hi>I do aſſert, that the
Cauſe of the Gout is not the Bloods abounding
with Acids but Alkalies.</hi> But in Oppoſition
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103742:71"/>
to this Aſſertion, I ſay, I aſſert, that it is
not from Alkalies, but Acids; and this I
ſhall prove, from what he hath ſaid of the
Gout in his Book of Alkaly and Acids; and
becauſe he deſires that Arguments againſt this
Book, ſhould be backed with Experiments, I
ſhall bring as ſubſtantial Experiments againſt
his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> as he hath for it, to wit, the
ſame, and ſhall ſhew, that he hath ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked
theſe Experiments, and underſtands
them ſo little, that he hath drawn falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
from them, and this I ſhall do, when
I come to his Book in its proper Place.</p>
                     <p>Page xix. He asks, <hi>if Acids abound in the
Blood, how comes a Dead Body to ſtink ſo ſoon;
every Body knows that Acids preſerve Animal
Substances from Stinking and Corruption.</hi> But
this relating to the Cauſe of the Gout, I
ſhould anſwer it when I come to that Cauſe,
which he hath laid down in his Book.</p>
                     <p>But for once I ſhall anſwer this Queſtion,
where it is asked; for that a dead Body
ſtinks ſo ſoon, only ſhews, that a Body in
a Natural State abounds with Alkalies; for a
Body that is killed by ſome ſudden Accident
will ſtink, as ſoon as one that dyes by a
Diſtemper; ſo that this proves nothing at all
in Relation to Diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>Page xxiij. He ſays, <hi>He hath had wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and aſtoniſhing Succeſs in the Cure of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>
And truly, It is aſtoniſhment to me;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103742:72"/>
for I wonder how any Body ever ſcaped
with their Lives, conſidering the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
he takes in moſt Diſtempers; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he uſed his Acids moderatly, ſo that
the Miſcheif might be leſs conſpicuous.</p>
                     <p>Page xxv. He ſays, <hi>I muſt needs confeſs,
that I have been the warmer in ſome of my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions;
that thereby I might exaſperate thoſe,
who are my profeſſed Enemies, to convince me
of my Errors;</hi> and if ſo, he did well; but
he only ſaith this to ſuggeſt to his Friends;
that they muſt take all that write againſt
him to be his Enemies, leſt they ſhould believe
what they ſay; but I profeſs I am ſo far from
being exaſperated towards him, or being his
Enemy, that I write only to detect ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Errors, and for Truth ſake, and did it lie
in my Power to make Intereſt for him in his own
Trade, I would do all I could to ſet him in it, as
far as he deſerves it; for I am ſorry to ſee him
grope in the Dark ſo miſerably, in a way he hath
no Underſtanding to lead him; and were I his
Friend, I ſhould cordially adviſe him, to follow
Light rather than Darkneſs, and like an honeſt
Man to fall to his Trade again; now he has
broke that Impoſtume in his Head, that filled
him ſo much with Vanity, and a corrupted
Maſs of diſmal dark Thoughts: But I am
afraid he is not capable of Advice, being ſo
much blown up with Conceit, that though a
<hi>Wiſe Man would hear Inſtruction, yet a Fool hates
Knowledg,</hi> as the Wiſe Man ſays.</p>
                     <p>

Page xxxij. He ſays, <hi>If any one will by
well grounded and ſubſtantial Experiments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
me of the contrary; inſtead of being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with him, I ſhall never ceaſe to Love and
Admire him;</hi> Indeed, I had once about a year
and half ago, at the College of Phyſcians, a
little Diſcourſe with him; and he was ſo
complacent as to tell a Friend of mine, he
had a great Opinion of me, but truly, as I
believe, I neither did then, nor deſerve it now,
ſo I was ſure I had no ſuch Opinion of him;
for all that he ſaid, was nothing, but what a
Parrot might have learnt by converſing with
Dr. <hi>Cole:</hi> But whatſoever good Opinion he
had of me then, I dare ſay he will turn his
Note now, though I ſhall take the way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his Love and Admiration, by ſhewing
him by ſubſtantial Experiments, that he is
miſtaken.</p>

                     <p>HAving gone through his Preface, and

where,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page</hi> Iſt. <hi>He ſays,</hi> This Book will fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Hands of many Ingenious Gentlemen, who
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103742:73"/>
are not Phyſicians; for whom it will be very
Natural to ſay, you here pretend to advance a
new Hypotheſis, in oppoſition to almoſt all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind—and
we therefore would be glad of
ſome more familiar Demonſtration, whereby we
might be ſatisfied without being put to much
Trouble.</p>
                     <p>For the ſatisfaction of whom, I will here lay
down a Method—whereby every Man is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being Judge, whether my Hypotheſis be
true or falſe.</p>
                     <p>Here I muſt needs ſay, he is in the right;
for it will be very Natural for them to ſay
ſo; and I am glad he hath the Luck to make
uſe of ſo plain an Experiment, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much trouble, will very eaſily let People
ſee, that his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is falſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for the Satisfaction of thoſe Gentlemen,
I ſhall ſhew, that this familiar Experiment
will prove he is miſtaken; and that he hath
drawn falſe Concluſions from it, becauſe he did
not underſtand it; which I ſhall make ſo
plain, that every Man may be capable of
being a Judge, that what he aſſerts is falſe;
for,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the latter End of Page</hi> Iſt. <hi>and Page</hi>
2d. <hi>He mentions his Experiment,</hi> viz. It is
well known that all Acids being poured upon Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
of Violets, or into a Solution of it, will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
turn it from a Blew into a very Red
Colour; and as the Acid is more or leſs ſtrong; ſo
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103742:73"/>
will the Red Colour be of a deeper or paler Dye.
On the other hand, all manifeſt Alkalies will turn
Syrup of Violets, or a Solution of it, from a
Blew into a Green Colour; from whence he infers,
that if the Serum of the Blood will alter the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of Syrup of Violets, from Blew to Red,
it would then be plain, that the ſaid <hi>Serum</hi> did
abound with Acid Particles. But if, on the
otherhand, the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood be mixed
with Syrup of Violets, inſtead of changing it's
Colour from Blew to Red, as Acids do: It
changes it to Green, as Alkalies do, it muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with Alkalies: <hi>And this Experiment,
He puts Page 3. into a Logical Form, to ſhew
how much Logic he hath got.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to wave his Logic, and come to the
Experiment; that all Acids will turn Syrup
of Violets Red is falſe; but I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of that further, when I come to his <hi>8th.</hi>
Page, and here I ſhall ſhew, that granting,
that all Acids will turn Syrup of Violets
Red, and that all Alkalies will turn it Green,
yet this Experiment is not for him, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him.</p>
                     <p>And tho' all Acids will not turn Syrup of
Violets Red, yet it's true, a great many will,
and a great many Alkalies will turn it Green;
this is all plain, and I allow it to be true, I
likewiſe grant, that the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood
mixed with Syrup of Violets will turn it
Green, which I take to be a Sign, in his Senſe,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103742:74"/>
that the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood abounds with
Alkalies; ſo that I grant, both that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
is true, and that allowing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of Acids and Alkalies, it proves what
he would have it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Blood abounds
with Alkaly. But for all his Logic, it does
not therefore follow, that Alkalies are the
Cauſe of Diſtempers; for the Blood of
healthful People abounds with Alkalies, as
appears by the ſame Experiment; nay, the
Blood of thoſe that have no Diſtempers at
all, abounds with Alkalies, and will turn
Syrup of Violets Green; ſo that to ſay Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies
are the Cauſe of Diſtempers, becauſe
the Blood abounds with them, is to prove
that healthful People abounds with Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
becauſe, it appears by this Experiment,
that their Blood is full of Alkaly; but
healthful People do not abound with
Diſtempers, <hi>Ergo</hi> Mr. <hi>John Colbatch</hi> is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
                     <p>And this I hope is ſo plain, that any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
may ſee he is miſtaken; for this is ſo
far from ſhewing, that Alkalies are the Cauſe
of Diſtempers, that it ſhews they cauſe
Health; for healthful Peoples <hi>Serum</hi> abounds
with Alkalies, and turns Syrup of Violets
Green; ſo that this Experiment does him no
Service, that he ſo much depends upon, but
on the contrary, ſhews his Error.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:103742:74"/>
And ſince he ſo much depends on this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment:
And ſince this is to qualifie every
Gentleman to judge; I have laid the Inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of it open, ſo plainly, that they may be
certain, if what he ſays be true, there is no
ſuch thing as a healthful Perſon; becauſe
every Bodies Blood abounds with Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p>But to make it clearer to every Gentleman,
that he not only alledges an Experiment, that
proves nothing for him; but alſo to make it
appear, that he does not underſtand what he
is about, and that the Gout proceeds from
Acids, we are to conſider, what is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and Conſtitution of the Blood in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
State, and how it differs from that in the
Gout.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, in a Natural and Healthful
State, if a Perſon be let Blood eight or ten
Ounces, any Gentleman may take notice,
that, if it be of a right Healthful Perſon,
when that Blood hath ſettled, and the <hi>Serum</hi>
and Blood are parted, the Blood will be pure
and Red on the outward ſide, and if preſſed
with ones Finger, or any thing elſe,
will be moderately tender; and the <hi>Serum</hi>
of the Blood will turn Syrup of Violets
Green.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> If one that hath the Gout be
permitted to Bleed; when that Blood is
ſeparated, the Blood will be more Viſcid,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103742:75"/>
and the <hi>Serum</hi> will turn Syrup of Violets
Green.</p>
                     <p>So that the difference between the Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and Diſtempered Blood, will appear to
any Gentleman to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
Diſtempered Blood is more Viſcid.</p>
                     <p>Again, Thoſe Gentlemen may obſerve, that
whereas the Healthful Blood is nothing but
pure thin <hi>Serum,</hi> and Blood; the Diſtempered
Blood will have a thick Viſcid white Skin o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it, which is part of the Diſtempered
Matter.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps, Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> will miſguide his
Friends, in making this Obſervation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I foretel them, that the Perſons muſt not
be let Blood, after a full Meal, and that the
Sick, or Healthful Perſon, muſt be let Bood
at an equal ſpace of time, <hi>viz.</hi> 5 or 6 hours
after a moderate Meal.</p>
                     <p>Now to any Ingenious Gentleman, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
thus by obſerving Nature, that the
Gouty Blood differs from Healthful thus, by
ſuch Viſcidity of the Blood, and ſome white
Coagulated Matter, which ſwims upon it, we
muſt conſider, what is the Cauſe of that Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity,
and then we know, what is the Cauſe
of the Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe then of this Viſcidity, is either
Acid or Alkaly, if it were Alkaly, then the
whole <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood would be Viſcid,
like that white Viſcid Matter, that ſticks to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103742:75"/>
the Blood; becauſe it appears, the whole
<hi>Serum</hi> abounds with Alkalies, by mixing it
with Syrup of Violets; ſo that here, his own
Experiment confutes himſelf; but that the
Cauſe of that Viſcidity is Acid, is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
drinking much Wine, which is Acid,
or any thing which cauſes Acidities in the
Stomach, brings a Fit of the Gout on ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and more violent; and any Gentleman
may be further ſatisfied, that Acids are the
Cauſe of Coagulated <hi>Serum,</hi> becauſe all Acids
curdle and thicken Milk, which is much of
the ſame Nature with Chyle.</p>
                     <p>For a further Confirmation, that this Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity
proceeds from Acids, I might here
bring all thoſe Arguments, I uſed, in Anſwer
to what he ſaid of the Gout, in his Book of
Alkalies and Acids; but what he ſaid there I
have already Anſwered `and I have here ſhewed,
that he hath alledged this Experiment againſt
himſelf, and therefore I need not repeat what the
Reader may eaſily turn to before.</p>
                     <p>From what I have ſaid here, it appears, that
the Reſult is this, that in a Natural State, the
Blood abounds with Alkalies, that is, that it
hath a great deal of Alkaly, and but a little
Acid; ſo as to make it moderately tender;
and that in a Diſtempered State, it alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with Alkalies, but hath too much
Acid mixed with it, ſo as to make it preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
Viſcid; from what I have ſaid, it alſo
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103742:76"/>
appears, that the Experiment he has alledged,
is only in reference to the thin <hi>Serum,</hi> and
makes no Proof of that Viſcid Matter,
which is the Cauſe of the Diſtemper; and in
both Natural and Preter-natural Blood, it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proves, that there is no Cauſe of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
perceivable in the <hi>Serum,</hi> becauſe it
abounds with Alkalies; and conſequently
Alkalies cannot cauſe the Diſtemper, becauſe
they cannot cauſe Coagulation, the <hi>Serum</hi> of
the Blood being full of Alkalies in a Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
State; ſo that the Concluſion from the
whole is, that Acids, abounding too much,
cauſe Coagulations, and conſequently thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
that Matter, which is the Cauſe of the
Gout. So that, tho' there is more Alkaly
than Acid in Gouty Blood, and in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Acid, the Alkaly abounds, yet
ſince Alkaly in a Healthful Body does not
cauſe the Gout, but it is the ſuperabundant
Acid by Coagulating that <hi>Serum,</hi> and Blood,
which cauſes thoſe ill Effects in the Gout;
and becauſe there is more Acid in Gouty
than Healthful Blood; the former in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the latter, abounds with Acids,
and the Gout conſequently muſt proceed,
from too much Acid, which cauſes thoſe
Coagulations.</p>
                     <p>Now from hence it appearing, that his
Experiment is not only invalid to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
but very ſtrong againſt it; and that he
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103742:76"/>
hath drawn falſe Concluſions from it; and that
too, by an Obſervation, equally as eaſy as
the Experiment, I ſhall proceed to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
how upon this fair Demonſtration of
his Ignorance, he boldly values himſelf;
and not only ſo, but imperiouſly, and with
Contempt, rails at the whole Learned World;
as if he alone had gained the Victory, when
alas! It is he alone that gropes ſo miſerably
in the Dark. And what Uſage muſt this
Man deſerve? Who upon Grounds ſo ſlight,
tho' true, and much more ſince they are
falſe, takes occaſion to huff the whole
World, and to tell them, no Body is in the
Right but himſelf.</p>
                     <p>But, that I may not paſs too ſevere a
Sentence upon him, I ſhall take notice, how
he hath condemned the World without
Grounds, and then ſure it cannot be thought
unreaſonable, that he ſhould have as ſevere a
Sentence, who hath given ſuch juſt Reaſons
for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page the 3. He ſays,</hi> Every Gentleman is
able to Reaſon thus with himſelf, my Phyſician
tells me my Blood abounds with Acids, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ſcore gives me Alkalies to Mortify and
Correct thoſe Acids in my Blood; But if my
Phyſician ſhould be mistaken and inſtead of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids
my Blood abounds with Alkalious Particles,
his giving me Alkalies must increaſe the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of my Distemper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—therefore ſince
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103742:77"/>
                        <hi>I have ſo fair an opportunity put into my Hands,
and by ſo eaſie an Experiment am capable of
being Judge my ſelf, what Particles my Blood
abounds with, my own Eyes ſhall be the Judge
whether Acids or Alkalies are to be blamed—if
the Blood abounds with Acids, he ought
to be kicked out of the Common-Wealth, for
endeavouring to impoſe upon Mankind.</hi> This
is the Sentence he thinks good enough for
himſelf, if it could be proved, that he was
miſtaken; I having therefore proved, that he
is in an Error, may venter to enlarge a little,
and ſay, he does not only deſerve to be
kicked out of a Common-Wealth, but out
of all Ingenious Mens Company; and this
Paragraph can no otherwiſe be anſwered than
thus,</p>
                     <p>Every Gentleman is able to Reaſon with
himſelf, Mr. <hi>John Colbatch</hi> tells me the Cauſe
of my Diſtemper is Alkalies, and upon that
ſcore gives me Acids, to Mortify and Correct
thoſe Alkalies in the Blood: But if Mr. <hi>John
Colbatch</hi> ſhould be miſtaken; and inſtead of
Alkalies, the Cauſe of my Diſtemper ſhould
be Acids, his giving me Acids, muſt increaſe
the Matter of my Diſtemper,—there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have ſo fair an Opportunity given me,
to ſee the Inſufficiency of this Experiment by
an eaſie Obſervation, am capable of being a
Judge my ſelf, and my own Eyes ſhall be the
Judges, whether Acids be not the Cauſe of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103742:77"/>
my Diſtemper, and truly it ſo plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that Mr. <hi>John Colbatch</hi> is miſtaken, and
that my Diſtemper proceeds from Acids, that
Mr. <hi>John Colbatch</hi> deſerves to be kicked
out of the Common-Wealth, for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to impoſe upon Mankind.</p>
                     <p>Page. 4. He ſays, <hi>He hopes from Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
he ſhall have Juſtice, tho' Phyſicians have
endeavoured to expoſe him.</hi> As for Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
they ſurely have Reaſon to expoſe him,
for a vain Pretender, ſince he hath given ſuch
pregnant Proof of it, and as for Gentlemen,
I have made it plain enough to them, by an
Obſervation as eaſie as they can wiſh, that he
hath no worſe Uſage than he really deſerves,
and then what he pronounces is his own
Merit.</p>
                     <p>And now the Reaſon is plain, why Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
have endeavoured to expoſe him, to
wit, becauſe he hath endevoured to expoſe
Mankind, when himſelf alone deſerves
it.</p>
                     <p>Pag. the <hi>6th.</hi> He goes on to value himſelf
upon this Experiment, and ſays, <hi>an Ounce or
two of Blood is to be ſpared in any Caſe, and
pray let People ſee with what Reaſon Alkalies
have been hitherto given in Small Pox, Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm,
&amp;c. It will plainly appear by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
that the Blood of ſuch Perſons abounds
with Alkalies, and if ſo, why ſhould we croud in
more Alkalies, unleſs it were to prolong the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103742:78"/>
or to encreaſe the Number of Fees.</hi> All
that I need to ſay to this is, ſince I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
made it appear, that Acid is the Cauſe of
thoſe Diſtempers, and that the <hi>Serum</hi> of health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Peoples Blood will turn Syrop of Violets
green, and that the only obſervable Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
betwixt Diſtempered Blood and Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Blood, is, that the Diſtempered Blood, as
well as ſome Part of the <hi>Serum,</hi> is Viſcid, and
that Viſcidity proceeds from Acids; and ſince
an Ounce or two of Blood is ſo eaſily ſpared,
in thoſe Caſes, Pray let People ſee, with
what great Reaſon Alkalies have been given,
and with what danger Acids are given; for
in his Chapter of the Gout, I have ſhewed,
that ſince the Blood in a Natural ſtate abounds
with Alkalies, even what he confeſſes about
Drinking of white Wine, which is an Acid,
proves, that the more Acids we take, the more
that Alkalious <hi>Serum</hi> will be coagulated, and
conſequently the Diſtemper encreaſed, and it
plainly appears by the Experiment he alledges,
and the Obſervation I have laid down, to
ſatisfy Ingenious Gentlemen, that Acid is the
Cauſe of Diſtempers; and ſince it is ſo plain,
why ſhould Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> croud in more Acids,
unleſs it were to prolong the Diſtemper, to
increaſe the Number of Fees.</p>
                     <p>He goes on, <hi>People muſt long ſince have known
the Truth of this Hypotheſis, or they muſt not, if
they have not known it, it is plain they have gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103742:78"/>
in the Dark, and they have cured Diſeaſes with
as much Certainty as a Blind Man can catch a Hare;
if they have known it before, then the giving of
Alkalies at the rate that hath been done is a plain
Argument againſt them, that they have not act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like honeſt Men: but I dare acquit them
from this Charge, I do believe they have ſworn
in Verbo Magiſtri.</hi> Wonderful! what cloſe
arguing and what ſenſible Expreſſions of a
blind Man, and groping in the Dark; this
groping in the Dark is ſuch a familiar Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
with him, that one would think he
were uſed to nothing elſe, and the Abſurdities
his whoſe Books are made up of, prove, he
is the only Blind Man in the Proverb, or hath
not Acted like an honeſt Man; but tho' he
were not an honeſt Man, he is a mighty Piece
of a Scholar, and hath put in two Latin words
here, <hi>In verbo Magiſtri,</hi> to ſhew, that either
he did not go to School long enough, or hath
forgot what he learnt there; for that Piece of
a Verſe in <hi>Juvenal,</hi> that he hath catched by
groping in the Dark is not <hi>in verbo Magiſtri,</hi>
but <hi>in verba Magiſtri;</hi> and indeed, the Sence of
<hi>in verba Magiſtri,</hi> is ſo much different from
<hi>in verbo Magiſtri,</hi> that it is plain he was gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in the Dark moſt miſerably, when he
wrote it; for <hi>firſt,</hi> it ſhews, he knew not
what he wrote, or <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it, for what greater Mark of his Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
than inſtead of ſaying, they were
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103742:79"/>
ſworn to maintain the Words of their Maſter,
he ſays, they were Sworn, in maintaining
the Words of their Maſter, as if to defend the
Words of their Maſter, were to take an Oath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He ſays further,</hi> And becauſe a few Book
Learned Gentlemen, have Dream't, that the
Bloods abounding with Acids, hath been the
Cauſe of Diſeaſes, therefore right or wrong it
muſt be ſo, tho' it be contrary to the moſt obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and plain Experiments.</p>
                     <p>What a Block-head is this, to tell all Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and Ingenious Men, they have Dream't,
what hath been confirmed and certified by
all the Experience of learned Practioners in
Phyſick; but he would have thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that he writes thus plain for, to think,
that is, only becauſe Phyſicians are his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
but I ask thoſe Ingenious Gentlemen,
that have been ſo impoſed upon, whether they
think, Men that writ their Obſervations 30,
or 40 years ago, and ever ſince, could write
what they did, in oppoſition to him, before
he made his Pretenees, and tho' all Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
now were his Enemies, thoſe were not;
ſo that I would have Gentlemen conſider, that
Phyſicians, now in Oppoſition to him, only
confirm by daily Experience, what was the
Univerſal Obſervation of all Learned Men,
before his time; and as for his moſt obvious
Experiment, I have ſhewed, that it does him
no Service at all, but is againſt him; ſo that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103742:79"/>
we have Reaſon to think, he alone has
Dream't, being in the Dark, for want of Book
Learning.</p>
                     <p>He goes on; <hi>When I appeal to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
of the Blood by the Fire, my Appeal is
then made to Phyſicians only, and this I have
already done, but they have refuſed to do me
Justice.</hi> As to his Appeal to Phyſicians, I
have, where he hath made it, ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
it, and proved, that his Analizing the
Blood, as he calls it, will do him little Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
but that Phyſicians may do him no
Injuſtice, I ſhall refer Ingenious Gentlemen to
a Book of the moſt famous and ingenious
Mr. <hi>R. Boyle,</hi> called his <hi>Sceptical Chymiſt,</hi>
which was writ before his, and which will
ſatisfy them, that the Blood is turned into
Subſtances, very much different from any
thing obſervable in the Blood, by Chymical
Analize; and that Author, who had ſuch
good Deſigns in all his Writings, cannot be
called his Enemy (nor Truths,) having writ
before him.</p>
                     <p>Page the <hi>6th.</hi> He ſays, <hi>Now ſince Justice
has been refuſed me by my Brethren, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be angry with me for making my Appeal to
thoſe whoſe Intereſt it is to do Juſtice to me, and
encourage me in my Honest Undertakings,</hi> I
really don't ſee any Reaſon his Brethren have
to envy him, nor to be angry with him, but
whom does he call his Brethren? The Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries?
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103742:80"/>
Phyſicians are not to be ranked with
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> yet, except thoſe as Ignorant as
himſelf: But as for thoſe Gentlemen, who
value the World to come, above this, and
the Happineſs of a better Life, above Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
their Intereſt it undoubtedly is, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
him, by all means; I ſhall not envy
their Happineſs in another World, but may
the Number of the Elect be ſoon accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!
but thoſe that have a mind to live, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to give him no other Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but what Subſtantial Shoo-leather
will, according to his own Sentence, Page
the <hi>Fourth, in kicking him out of the Common-Wealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ſame Page he ſays, <hi>None can
blame him for writing in that warm Manner he
hath done; becauſe he hath not reſerved one Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
to himſelf.</hi> But for good Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is not one thing worth Reſerving;
but he is more to be blamed for his warm
Writing, except he had made ſome Secret
known, that would have ſhewn he had
Reaſon, ſawcily to contradict all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                     <p>But in the latter End of his Page he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
<hi>He hath been too much meal-mouthed,
and too modeſt.</hi> His Modeſty indeed is of
a new kind, and very remarkable; and as
for his meal mouth, I cannot well interpret
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103742:80"/>
it, except his diſreſpectful Behaviour towards
his Betters, be the Meal, that fouled it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page 7. He ſays,</hi> The following Treatiſe
of the Gout is built upon my Hypotheſis of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies
and Acids, upon which Score, I thought
it neceſſary by way of Introduction to Publiſh
the foregoing eaſy Experiment, that thereby the
whole World might be ſatisfied of the Truth or
Falſhood of his Hypotheſis.</p>
                     <p>Having therefore ſhewed, that his <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi>
of Alkaly and Acid is Falſe, and Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent,
his Treatiſe muſt need be ſo too;
his eaſy Experiment, together with my eaſy
Obſervation, ſhewing that his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is
Erroneous; ſo that, I might ſave my ſelf
the Trouble of a further Examination, were
it not for the ſake of Ingenious Gentlemen,
who are not competent Judges.</p>
                     <p>Page the <hi>8th.</hi> He ſays, <hi>Were there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one Acid that would turn a Solution of Syrup
of Violets from a Blew Colour to that of Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>I ſhould not inſiſt ſo much upon the
Experiment, as I have done.</hi> To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he hath inſiſted upon the Experiment,
I have already ſhewn, but that he may inſiſt
upon it the leſs in his own Thoughts, I ſhall
inſtance one Acid, that turns Syrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
Green, as well as <hi>Arſenick,</hi> his exalted Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly,
as he calls it, which is <hi>Mercurius Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limat.</hi>
but perhaps he'll call it an Alkaly;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103742:81"/>
and therefore I ſhall ſatisfy Ingenious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

                     </p>
                     <p>But undoubtedly, he'll tell them, they
are miſtaken, No-body can ſee beſides himſelf:
But theſe Mens Opinions will be taken before
his, ſince he cannot at all pretend, they were
his Enemies, both their Books being wrote
before his Time.</p>
                     <p>Page the <hi>8th,</hi> and <hi>9th.</hi> He ſays, <hi>Phyſicians he
owns have been able to Cure ſome few Diſeaſes,
but how they have done it, themſelves could never
tell; they, without inquiring nicely into the Natures
of them, or being at the trouble of Analizing, have
given Steel, Antimony,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>By means of which
they have Cured ſeveral Diſeaſes, but they
have given them as Alkalies, when they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to an Inquiſitive Perſon to be Acids,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Now their giving of theſe Things hath ſtood
them in ſome ſtead, and cured many Diſtempers
by a way they were ignorant of.</hi> How unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
he hath changed the Names of theſe
Medicines, I have already ſhewn, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall not repeat it again, I ſhall only here
take notice, how he contradicts himſelf, no leſs
then three times in one Page. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> He
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103742:82"/>
ſays, they have been able indeed to cure a
few Diſtempers: And then they have cured
ſeveral Diſtempers; and laſt of all, a many
Diſtempers; and thoſe Diſtempers, he ſays,
they have cured no Body knows how; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were not at the trouble of Anali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing:
but if he were not forgetful, he would
ſcarce think himſelf the only Chymiſt in the
World; for would he allow any Body a
ſmall ſhare of Knowledg, beſides himſelf,
he would know, that much more Pains hath
been taken by wiſe and able Chymiſts, Men
that knew better how to make Obſervations,
than he does, who wants Natural Philoſophy
to direct him, as well as Judgment and Skill;
and there are now Men ſo qualified. And
tho' Chymiſtry be of great Uſe in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
as well as Phyſick, when cultivated
by Ingenious Men, yet notwithſtanding all
the Pains they had taken, it proved in vain,
to enable them the better to diſcover the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
or rather Texture and Complexion of
thoſe ſeveral Humors in a Man's Body; and
their Inſufficiency, the famous Mr. <hi>Robert
Boyle</hi> hath ſufficiently, ſhewed; and therefore
we may well think, ſince we have Reaſon,
his Pains will prove to no more purpoſe; for
let him ſpend more time than he hath, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo long; it will ſtill be in Vain; for Bodies
looſe their former Complexion, when Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically
diſſolved, every Particle, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103742:82"/>
anew. But it is no Diſparagement to
Chymiſtry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither is it the leſs valuable,
becauſe it will not diſcover <hi>ultra terminos,</hi> and
beyond it's Bounds, no more than a Plow,
becauſe it is of no uſe at Sea.</p>
                     <p>But he ſays, <hi>Phyſicians have cured ſome
Diſtempers they know not how.</hi> Here I ſhall
take Occaſion, to propoſe one thing to the
Conſideration of thoſe Honeſt Gentlemen,
who have had the ill Fortune to be deluded
by him; they being induced to think, he
hath Skill and Ingenuity, becauſe ſome
People recover, whom he miſuſes, <hi>viz.</hi>
whether (ſince I ſhewed he is miſtaken in all
he hath aſſerted,) they may not reaſonably
conclude he cured them he knew not how? I,
for my own Part, am ſure he knew not how;
but as for thoſe Ingenious Gentlemen, I leave
it to their own conſideration; whether one
Man may not ſooner be miſtaken, than one
Thouſand, who agree in the ſame Opinion,
which Number, tho' it be not in <hi>London,</hi> yet
it is double in <hi>Europe,</hi> whoſe Practice agree
in Succeſs and Reaſon, in Oppoſition to his,
and two or three Adherents.</p>
                     <p>Page 11. He ſays, <hi>I have all this while
been talking as a Phyſician, but not as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt;
for though I account for the Cauſe and
Cure of Distempers from Alkalies and Acids,
yet I don't pretend to account for all the</hi> Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
<hi>of Nature, from thoſe two Principles, thoſe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103742:83"/>
there have been thoſe that have undertaken ſo to
do, but I conceive they have been very much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
Truly, many have undertaken Things,
that they have been much miſtaken in; but for
one that hath undertaken no more than he hath
done, to be ſo grandly miſtaken, is a ſign of
his great Weakneſs: And he hath all this
while, I rather think, been talking as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt,
than a Phyſician; a Naturaliſt I
mean, becauſe what he ſays looks, as if it
came from one that knew no more of what
he was about, than what he had from the
glimmering falſe Light of a dull Nature.</p>
                     <p>He goes on; <hi>There are many</hi> Phaenomena
<hi>in Natural Bodies, that are not to be accounted
for by the Mutual Conflict of thoſe two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
(if I may ſo call them) ſuch as Motion
and Reſt, Light and Darkneſs,</hi> Magnetiſm
<hi>or the Loadſtone, and a great many others too
many here to inſert.</hi> Here he is extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
modeſt, and having groped in the Dark
ſo far, is loath to make any further Progreſs
in it. But what need was there here for him,
after a long tedious Blunder, about the Cauſe
of the Gout, to give a Hint at theſe <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
belonging to Natural Philoſophy,
which he underſtands nothing of; but by his
ſmattering of Philoſophy, he would have
People think, he knows ſomething of it:
This puts me in mind of a Dunghil Cock,
that vapours and ſtruts over a Heap of Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103742:83"/>
as if he were Maſter Controuler of
all his little Head can take a View of; and
from thence take a flight to ſome gilded Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
where with a mighty Crow, he ſeems
to proclaim himſelf Maſter of that noble
Edifice; when alas! He takes Poſſeſſion of
no more, than he covers with his Claws; and
this Inſtance, I think, as truly repreſents Mr.
<hi>Colbatch,</hi> as a Picture can repreſent a Man
in his abſence, for as the Cock values him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon his Dunghil, ſo does he upon his
Miſtakes and Blunders; and knows leſs in
Philoſophy, than the Cock does of the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</p>
                     <p>Page the <hi>12th</hi> and <hi>13th</hi> are filled up with
a Letter from Dr. <hi>Jones:</hi> I ſhall take no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Letter, ſince it is only a Story,
wherein he may affirm what Falſities he
pleaſes, but only the Concluſion of it,
which ſhews Dr. <hi>Jones</hi> his Deſign in it, <hi>viz.
Make what uſe you pleaſe of this Catalogue to
Print or what you will, it is intended for your
Service.</hi> For ſince he wrote it, only with a
Deſign to ſerve the Eternal Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> no
doubt, but he would ſtrain to deſerve a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
from Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> again; but I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Dr. <hi>Jones</hi> wants Mr. <hi>Colbatch's</hi> good Word,

                     <p>I Have now ſufficiently anſwered his Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,

and my Obſervation, make the Foundation he
hath built this Book upon, void; and that
he is but miſtaken: I now proceed to his
Book, and ſhall examin what he hath ſaid as
to the Cauſe of this Diſtemper, in his firſt
Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Page the <hi>15th.</hi> He ſays, <hi>The Gout is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
Articularis Morbus, <hi>becauſe it generally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
ſome of the Joints, and according to the
Name of the Joint affected, it hath a different
Denomination, when it affects the Hand or
Fingers, it is called</hi> Chiragra, <hi>when it affects
the Hip</hi> Sciatia, <hi>when the Feet</hi> Podagra, &amp;c.
Now if according to the different Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gout, it affects a different Joint,
and takes it's Name from that; I would know
whether there be a Joint called the Hand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be a Joint called the Hip, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Joint called a Foot; if there be not, then
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> hath ſtarted in a wrong Way,
and the Diſtemper hath not it's Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Name of a Joint affected, but
from the Parts affected, for <hi>Podagra</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the Gout in the Foot, where there is no
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103742:84"/>
Joint called by that Name, but in which are
contained a great many Joints; and likewiſe
in the Hands, there is no Joint called <hi>Chira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra,</hi>
but that Part contains in it a great many
Joints; and the Gout is not called <hi>Morbus Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularis,</hi>
becauſe one Particular Joint is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
but becauſe it is <hi>circa Articulos,</hi> ſo
that the firſt thing he ſays, in this Elaborate
Piece, is, a Piece full of Miſtakes; and truly
I think very ominous, for as the Gout is an
Index of it ſelf, ſo I think this is an Index of
the whole Work, for to ſtart in a wrong Road,
is ſcarce the way to the Journeys End.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame Page He ſays, <hi>It ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
it ſelf with ſo much Cruelty and Tyranny,
that thoſe that are troubled with it, are almoſt
ready to lay Violent Hands upon themſelves.</hi>
O Tyrant! O Cruelty! That would make
Men murther themſelves for nothing but Pain:
But is not this a ſtrange Impoſition and Charge
laid to ingenious Gentlemen, to tell them, they
are ready to murther themſelves; but for
this Fault, if they can pardon him, I can.</p>
                     <p>Page the 16. <hi>The Gout may be divided into
two Species,</hi> viz. <hi>Hereditary and Adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
What a Judicious Diviſion of the Gout
is this, but he ſtoped too ſoon, for each of
thoſe Species are again divided into Species
of another Rank; as <hi>Podagra, Chiragra,</hi>
&amp;c. But a Man that gropes in the Dark, may
well be afraid of ſtepping too far.</p>

Page the 16. <hi>The Gout is an Index of it ſelf;
and no one that feels the Pain, but is capable of
diſcerning the difference between it and all other
Pains.</hi> But this is falſe, for one that hath
the Pain of the Gout, no more knows what
other Pain is, than one that is acquainted
with <hi>England</hi> and not <hi>France,</hi> knows <hi>France;</hi>
for to diſtinguiſh the Pain of the Gout, from
another Pain, the ſame Perſon muſt have
that Pain too; for how does a Man in a
Gouty Fit know, what Pain it would be to
have his Leg cut off, or does a Child that
hath cut his Finger, know what Pain it would
be to have the Gout; one that never had the
Tooth-ake, wonders, it can be ſo violent, and
never knows, till he has had it, what Reaſon
others had to complain.</p>
                     <p>Page 16. <hi>The Pain of the Gout being a deep
diſtending, piercing, throbbing, continual, bitter
Pain.</hi> This is a Deſcription of Pain, as ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Cramp, as Gout; for I have heard
one, that I am very well accquainted with,
make it juſt ſuch a Complaint; but why
ſhould Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> call Pain bitter? Except
he's reſolved to agree with old Women, in
calling Pain a Taſte.</p>
                     <p>Page 16. <hi>I do apprehend the Parts most
immediately affected to be the Glandules imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
joyning to the Perioſtium.</hi> But I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
he is much miſtaken; for the Glandules
are neither ſenſible, nor are they capable of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103742:85"/>
ſwelling on a ſudden, ſo as to diſtend the
parts to that degree, as they are in the Gout;
but I here refer the Reader to what the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Dr. <hi>Havers</hi> and others have ſaid on
this Subject. After this,</p>
                     <p>Pag. 17. He ſays, <hi>Father Malbranch tells us,
that our Senſes are given us to guard our ſelves
from Injuries, and that they never fail to anſwer
the end for which they were given us; they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
guilty of deceiving us.</hi> This Quotation,
I ſuppoſe, is only to let us know, that he
hath ſeen <hi>Malbranch,</hi> and muſt needs have a
ſcrap out of him, tho' nothing to his Purpoſe,
for what ſignifies it to tell People, to what
end their Senſes were given them, when he
is only endeavouring to diſcover what Pain is;
but he and his Father are here for once mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken;
for they fail to guard us from Injuries,
and very often deceive us: they fail to guard
us from Injuries, ſo much, that they are the
only Cauſes, that make Things Injuries, that
otherwiſe would not be offenſive, as every
ſmall Blow or bitter Taſte, every terrible
Sound, and threatning Word; it is true, our
Senſes are the only things, that make us ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Pleaſure, yet are thoſe the Inſtruments,
which lay us open to as many Injuries; and
that they are guilty of deceiving us, is plain,
ſince we have ſuch an Inſtance in himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Pag. <hi>17th.</hi> He goes on; <hi>As for Inſtance
our Taſte never tells us, that bitter is ſweet, or
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103742:86"/>
ſweet bitter, our ſmells never fail of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heat from cold, and cold from heat, and ſo on:
and all theſe proceed from a Placid Vellicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Membranes. Pain proceeds from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of the fibers, and Pleaſure from a pacid
Relaxation of them.</hi> What he means by a placid
Vellication, and a placid Relaxation, I believe
is ſcarce common Senſe; but I cannot but take
notice here, how prettily and conſiderately
Father <hi>Malbranch</hi> preſides his Contradiction:
for, firſt, He ſays Pleaſure and Pain proceed
from a Placid Vellication of the Membranes;
and then, that Pain is a Contraction, and
Pleaſure a Pacid Relaxation; but the Pain
that Cold cauſes, can ſcarce be a Vellication
and a Contraction too, there being as much
Difference betwixt ſtretching of a Rope, and
twiſting of it, when they make them, as
there is betwixt hanging and not hanging;
whether he deſerves it or not.</p>
                     <p>The latter End of the 17 and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the 18. He ſays; <hi>And I do lay it
down as a poſſitive Aſſertion, that all Pain is
cauſed by a Stagnation of the Juices, which
cauſes a Compreſſion of the Membranes:</hi> But
here He is poſitive a little too ſoon, for tho'
it were granted, that there were a Stagnation
of the Juices, yet Pain is not cauſed by a
Compreſſion of the Membranes, but by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally
affecting that which is the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Being, which Membranes by no means
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103742:86"/>
are; but ſince he does lay it down as a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Aſſertion, that all Pain is cauſed by a
Stagnation of the Juices; I (that being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
lay it down as another Aſſertion, that were
there Reaſon to draw ſuch a Concluſion from
the Pain of the Gout proceeds from Acids;
for ſince it is the Nature of Acids to thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the Blood, and it's <hi>Serum,</hi> and ſince the
more Acid it is, the thicker it will be, and
ſince Acid will thicken the <hi>Serum,</hi> and Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
will not; and again, ſince Coagulation
make the <hi>Serum</hi> ſubject to obſtruct, it muſt
needs follow, that thoſe Obſtructions in the
Gout proceed from Acids; but becauſe he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to ingenious Gentlemen, I ſhall give
an Inſtance, that Acids thicken the <hi>Serum,</hi>
and conſequently cauſe Obſtructions; and ſo
pain, that thoſe ingenious Gentlemen may
ſee the Truth of it; and becauſe he ſhall
have no way to perſwade Gentlemen, that
the Inſtance is not true, I deſire them for
their own ſatisfaction to look back to the
firſt Page of his Introduction, where they
have his own Confeſſion, that Niter is an
Acid; now almoſt any Gentlemen (and I
dare Appeal to them;) knows, that upon tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cold, ſome Peoples Heads will be ſtuffed
with Phlegm, or elſe they will ſpit a great
deal of Phlegm; which ſhews, that Acids
cauſe the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood to thicken, and
conſequently obſtruct, and ſometimes cauſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103742:87"/>
Pain in the Head; but ſome People are not
ſubject to ſpit Phlegm, nor to the Pain of the
Head, and for thoſe Gentlemen, I have another
Inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Niter of the Air thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
moſt Liquids with which it is mixed, as
Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in Froſty Weather, when it
is, Violent enough, even Milk and Water will
be Frozen which is a fort of Coagulation by a
Mixture of Acids.</p>
                     <p>And here, I ſhall let all ingenious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
nay and all <hi>knowing Women,</hi> underſtand,
that Acid cauſes moſt Diſtempers; for any
<hi>Obſerving Woman</hi> out-does Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> ſo far,
that ſhe knows taking cold (which is cauſed
by <hi>Acid Nitrous Particles)</hi> cauſes People to
fall into Rheumatiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they know
likewiſe, that taking cold, often occaſions
<hi>Stitches up and down in the Body,</hi> in which there
is Pain; and conſequently (by Mr. <hi>Colbatch)</hi>
confeſſed to proceed from Obſtructions.</p>
                     <p>And that they may know Alkalies do not
cauſe Obſtructions, they muſt remember, that
the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood in Healthful People
turns Syrup of Violets Green, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
according to Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> abounds
with Alkalies, yet they are not troubled with
Pain or Obſtructions; in the Pleuriſie it is alſo
obſerved, that their Blood abounds with a ſiezy
Gelly; which Diſtemper happens often upon
taking great Colds; the Blood being thicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Acid Nitrous Particles of the Air:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103742:87"/>
and theſe Obſervations I have laid down; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are ſuited to the Apprehenſions of
ingenious Gentlemen, and diſcerning Women
who are impoſed upon by him.</p>
                     <p>And I have another plain Obſervation, that
will ſatisfie all <hi>Obſerving Women,</hi> that Acids
cauſe Diſtempers; for nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
than that taking cold ſtops Womens
Courſes, the Acid Particles of the Air coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating
their Blood, and cauſing Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and nothing is more common, that that
Children and young Women drive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the Green-ſickneſs, by eating Fruit,
which Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> in his Appendix of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly
and Acid, owns are Acids; ſo that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
very plainly to all ingenious People,
that are not Phyſicians, that all Pain and
Obſtructions proceed from Acids, and not
Alkalies; and conſequently not only the
Gout, but Rheumatiſms, Scurvy, Small Pox,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceed from Acid; and conſequently
are to be cured with Alkalies; ſo that all that
he hath ſaid, or has to ſay, about the Uſe of
Acids muſt be falſe and dangerous; and I
need not go any further in the Proof of it, for
all ingenious People are already ſatisfied; only
for the Authors ſake, I ſhall ſhew him what
little Reaſon he hath to be ſo proud of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
for I would fain have him humble, becauſe
Humility may correct a Multitude of Sins,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103742:88"/>
and God knows how much need he hath of
it, who alone can tell.</p>
                     <q>Quot—aegros Autumno occiderit uno,</q>
                     <p>Or in other Words, how many ſuch a one, as
Mr. <hi>Coblatch,</hi> hath ſent to their long Home;
but truly, Mankind takes leſs Notice of
it, becauſe, as he ſays, Page 26. of this
Treatiſe.</p>
                     <q>Quoniam ſucceſſus ejus Sol videt; Errores
autem tellus opperiret.</q>
                     <p>In other Words, thoſe he hath not killed, cry
him up, but thoſe he hath overcharged
with moſt noble Acids, lie ſilent in the
Grave.</p>
                     <p>Page the <hi>19th.</hi> He ſays, <hi>The Gout may in
general be defined to be a Pain of the Joints
and Parts adjacent, occaſioned from an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated
Alkaline Humour, which irritates the
Membranes of the Joints and Parts adjacent.</hi>
A very Learned Definition of the Gout!
How can it properly be called a Pain of the
Joints, when it is an Irritation only of the
Membranes of the Joints, except a Membrane
were a Joint; but he might as well call an Acron
an Axle Tree. But the Gout he ſays is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a Pain; he forgets how the Parts
adjacent are ſwelled, and that an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
accompanyes it: But no wonder!
when ſuch a ſhort ſighted Man turns De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103742:88"/>
maker, that his Definitions are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</p>
                     <p>But further He ſays, <hi>The Pain is occaſioned
from an extravaſated Alkaline Humour, which
irritates the Membranes of the Joints.</hi> But
truly he is to be excuſed, he only contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
himſelf; either he knows not how, or
he forgets himſelf; for the Page before he ſaid,
<hi>He laid it down as a poſitive Aſſertion, that all
Pain is cauſed by a Stagnation of the Juices;
which cauſeth a Compreſſion of the Membranes.</hi>
But ſuppoſing it were, as he here ſays, an Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation
of the Membranes, and the firſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he gave were falſe, yet an Alkalizated
Humor, ſuch as the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood,
would be incapable of cauſing Pain; if it
were not, Healthful People would never be
without Pain; but here I will appeal to thoſe
Ingenious Gentlemen, that he hath ſo often
made his Appeal to, and ſhall inſtance another
eaſie Obſervation, whereby they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that an Acid Juice is capable of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
very violent Pains; whereas Alkalizated
Humours are not at all ſubject to irritate the
Membranes, and to this end, let them take
a little Vinegar, and waſh but a cut Finger
with it, ſo that the ſenſible Membranes may
be irritated by it, and it will cauſe a moſt
violent Heat and Pain, yet it taſtes cool on
the Tongue; from whence we may gather,
that an Acid ſharp Humour, when extravaſed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103742:89"/>
ſo as to fall upon the ſenſible Membranes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
will cauſe a violent Heat and Pain in the
Gout; this is a very plain and obvious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
and any Body may be aſſured of
the Truth of it very eaſily.</p>
                     <p>Now as this proves, that Acids will cauſe
Pain and Heat, and conſequently inflame; ſo
if thoſe ingenious Gentlemen will but take
a little Vinegar, and put an Alkaly into it,
as Chalk or Crabs-Eyes, and put that Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizated
Vinegar upon a cut Finger, they will
find, that it will not cauſe much Pain; but
they muſt be ſure to put none of the Powder
upon the Wound along with it; and this
ſhews not only that an Alkalizated Humour
will cauſe leſs Pain, than an Acid; but alſo,
that Alkalies will abate the pain of the Gout;
for if Alkalies take ocff the ſharpneſs of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar,
why will they not from thoſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
that corrode the Membrances in the
Gout?</p>
                     <p>And here I would deſire ingenious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to taſte Vinegar, and then that, into which
they put Chalk; and they will plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the good Effects of Alkalies in correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſharp and irritating Humours.</p>
                     <p>Page the <hi>20th.</hi> He ſays, <hi>Now Acids be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the only things that hinder Fermentations
and prevent Fevers, it is impoſſible they ſhould
be in the Fault, but Alkalies exciting Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and by conſequence cauſing Fevers,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103742:89"/>
they are neceſſarily here to be blamed, and were
timely Care taken to correct the Luxuriant Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalious
Particles, I am ſure it would be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Matter to prevent a Fit.</hi> But what is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe Luxuriant Particles in Fevers to the
Gout, he might as well ſay, if Dogs were kept
from pulling the Hedges in Pieces on the
High-Way; there would not be ſuch Wars in
the World, nor Countries ſpoiled and plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for Fevers and Gout, ingenious Gentlemen
know, are two different things; and he might
as rationally conclude, that Killing a Mouſe
would Kill a Man; as that curing a Fever
would prevent the Gout.</p>
                     <p>The remaining Part of the 20 <hi>Page,</hi> the
21, 22, and Part of the 23, are taken up
with a Deſcription of the Manner of this
Diſtemper's Invaſion, tranſcribed from Dr.
<hi>Sydenham,</hi> amongſt which, ſome ſimple
Sentences of his own are interſperſed, which
already have been ſufficiently anſwered. In
the latter Part of that Page, He ſays; <hi>There
are ſeveral Things occur in order to this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
But what he calls Things; he ſhould
have called acceſſory Cauſes; in the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of which I ſhall proceed to obſerve his
Dexterity, and then make Remarks upon the
whole collectively.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page the 24. the firſt of the Things, as he
calls them, is,</hi> Too moiſt a State of Air,
which hinders free Tranſpiration; by which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103742:90"/>
Means the Excrementitious Alkaline Particles,
which ſhould be thrown out by the Cutaneous
Pores, are retained, and the Quantity of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious
Alkaly, which is thrown out that
way, thoſe Paſſages being free, is not inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
which Particles being retained in the Blood
do greatly contribute towards the Raiſing of
this Unruly Devil, which the wiſeſt of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
hitherto have not been able to lay, which
hath been the occaſion of that Saying.</p>
                     <q>Solvere Nodoſam neſcit Medicina Podagram.</q>
                     <p>But here I muſt tell him, that if the Moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Air only produced ſuch ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,
by preventing Tranſpiration; all
People would be equally prejudiced by it,
and we ſhould as ſoon ſee poor People
troubled with it, who labour continually
in moiſt fenny Countries; and how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
would it be, for poor Country Men to
encompaſs their Ground with Ditches, if the
Dampneſs and Moiſture that affects their
Bodies there, ſhould throw them into the
Gout by ſtopping Tranſpiration, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
Nature from throwing off Excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Alkaline Particles; but were ſtopping
Tranſpiration all the Prejudice moiſt Air
could do, that would be eaſily helped another
way; for as it is obſerved by the Famous Dr.
<hi>Lower,</hi> that which ſupplies Tranſpiration
in Bed, runs off by Urin, when we are
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103742:90"/>
out of Bed; ſo although in moiſt Weather
Tranſpiration ſhould be ſtopped, more then
in dry Weather, it would do them no harm;
becauſe the leſs runs off by Tranſpiration,
the more does by Urine, and <hi>à converſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Reaſon, why moiſt Air is ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial,
is, becauſe the Circumference of our
Body is ſo Relaxed by that Moiſture, as to
leave the Pores open; which by admitting
too much Niter into the Maſs of Blood,
(the Natural Heat of our Bodies being
depreſſed) Crudities are bred in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Concoction, as the Antients called
it; which External Acceſſary Cauſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
with a Natural Prediſpoſition, and
the Acid Particles of the Air joyned with thoſe
Prediſpoſed Humours, cauſe ſuch Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
as the Obſtructions in the Parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
(in this Diſtemper) are accompanied
with; ſo that beſides the Moiſture of the
Air, there is a Natural inclination and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
in our Bodies, which makes
that Moiſter Air prejudicial to Gouty Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Acid Coagulating their Blood,
and diſpoſing them to Crudities; and not,
becauſe inſenſible Tranſpiration is ſtop'd.</p>
                     <p>But the wonderful Diſcoveries of this
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> are not a little to be Admired!
For he is the firſt Man that ever perceived
the Devil to appear in the ſhape of the Gout;
I heard indeed when I was a Boy, that the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103742:91"/>
Devil was to be diſtinguiſhed from a Man by
a great Cloven Foot, but I could never have
thought that Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
his Gouty Patients, to ſo many Devils,
except he had Dream't he was a Phyſician to
ſuch, before he wrote this Page in his Book.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He ſays,</hi> The Wiſeſt Magicians being not
able to cure the Gout was the occaſion of that
Saying.</p>
                     <q>Solvere Nodoſam neſcit Medicina Podagram.</q>
                     <p>But why they ſhould ſay Phyſicians can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Cure the Gout, becauſe Magicians can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
I ſee not any Reaſon, except a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
and a Magician are equally the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Page 23. <hi>But this is one of thoſe Devils
which are not to be caſt out, but by Prayer and
Faſting, that is Nature her ſelf, without help,
is not able to get the Maſtery of it, to rid her
ſelf from it.</hi> It ſeems it is a Devil in earneſt,
and truly I believe they are worſe than Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt,
that make Uſe of ſuch a Phyſician;
but he hath too ſoon concluded, that this
kind is to be cured by Prayer and Faſting,
I ſcarce think he ever cured any by ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions:
And I cannot but admire, what
a pretty ſort of a Divine he would have
made, who hath ſuch an excellent knack at
interpreting Scripture; who calls Prayer and
Faſting. Nature.</p>

Page 24. <hi>Nature hath hitherto been rather
Oppreſſed than Aſſiſted, this Hydra, being not
to be overcome, but by pouring in of freſh Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions
armed with pointed Spears and Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
upon him,</hi> viz <hi>by giving large Quantities of
Medicines, whoſe Particles are pointed.</hi> O
what a ſtrange Metamorphoſis! The Devil
is turned Hydra? And what's more ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Gentlemen muſt ſwallow whole Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions

ſtrong Preſcription; this ſure was a Dream
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he had reaſon to think of
ſuch terrible Medicines; but he unriddles this,
and calls Acids Armed Men and Spears, and
really not without reaſon; but Gentlemen
have reaſon to fear, that ſuch pointed Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
would rather increaſe, than eaſe their

of Meat, and the too great Ingurgitation of
them;</hi> and then he ſays, <hi>The Stomach being
put out of order, a foundation is laid for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers;</hi>
and for that reaſon, <hi>Page 25.</hi> he
ſays, <hi>As his Predeceſſors have explained Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
by Acids, ſo he will by Alkalies.</hi> A
very noble deſign, and upon very good
Grounds; but it were unreaſonable, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
him or his Predeceſſors to aſcribe Acids
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103742:92"/>
or Alkalies for the Cauſe of Diſtempers,
merely becauſe the Stomach was foul; but
he ought firſt to conſider, whether of theſe
two were predominant in the Stomach, when
the foundation of ſuch Diſtempers was laid,
which is the way to make it appear, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Alkaly or Acid be the cauſe of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
                     <p>So that in order to a right knowledge,
whether of theſe two are predominant, we
are to conſider how Digeſtion is carried on
naturally, and then it will appear, what is the
reaſon, that two much Meat hinders it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not here go about, to explain Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
any further, than is neceſſary to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Purpoſe, and ſhall therefore refer the
Reader to his own Obſervation, who cannot
but take notice, that the better his Meat and
Drink is, the better he digeſts it, if what
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> ſays were true, in his <hi>Novum
Lumen Chirurgicum,</hi> viz. <hi>The more generous
our Drink is, the better;</hi> ſo that were he to be
judged by his own Words, (which I have
ſhewed how far they are falſe) Indigeſtion,
when we eat too much, muſt proceed from
the Fermentation in the Stomach, being too
low, and conſequently Crudities, or raw un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted
Chyle, muſt be carried into the
Blood, to lay the Grounds of a Diſtemper;

Scraps of Philoſophy, there wants <hi>Alkalies to

                     <p>Page 25. he ſays, <hi>The ſame Alkaly which
being thrown upon the Joints, cauſe the Gout,

Brain, may cauſe a Staggering, and may occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an Apoplexy.</hi> Really ſince Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi>
ſaid it, it is very much to be wondered at;
that Alkalies ſhould be ſo miſchievous, as
to coagulate the Morbifick Matter of the
<hi>Gout,</hi> and cauſe <hi>Apoplexies,</hi> and yet <hi>in the Small
Pox break Globules,</hi> and be guilty of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
miſchief, by thining the Blood, and
throwing it out through Veſſels, through
which it was before too fine to paſs; but any
thing that's miſchievous, hath ſuch a kindneſs
for him, that it will be black or white, as he
wou'd have it, otherwiſe one would think, to
thin, and to thicken, are widely different Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for Alkalies to do, but I have before ſhewn
the Abſurdities of what he ſaid, as to theſe
Diſtempers, and ſhall not now enlarge upon
them.</p>
                     <p>The remaining part of <hi>Page 25.</hi> and <hi>Page

he formerly gave of the Reaſon, why drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wine does Men that are inclined to the
Gout, ſo much harm, which I having in his
Chapter of the Gout, (publiſhed in his Eſſay
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103742:93"/>
of Acids and Alkalies,) and alſo in this, ſhew'd
to prove, that the Gout proceeds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from
Acids, there is no need to repeat what I there
ſaid: Again,</p>

uſe of Venereal Exerciſes—every Body
experiences, that by a few Venereal Embraces,
his Spirits become more Languid.</hi> Poor Man!
one may ſee what comfort his poor Wife hath,
if he hath one; if he hath not, one may learn
how he came to be ſo compaſſionate to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick
Faces in the Small-Pox, he ſpeaks ſo
ſenſible in the caſe, but he ſays, <hi>every Body

than I thought it had been, for one might
reaſonably expect a Boy at Ten had never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
ſuch things, but one may ſee, he
begun to enervate himſelf betimes: But to be
ſerious,</p>
                     <p>If Alkalies were the cauſe of the Gout,
then Venery would cure the Gout; becauſe
it draws off the Alkalies of the Blood and
Spirits, by taking away thoſe parts that invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate
the heat of the Blood, but ſince taking
away Alkalies, makes Men ſubject to the
Gout, by leaving the Blood weak and flaggy;
it follows, that the Gout proceeds from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
which always moſt abound in Blood that
is leaſt Spiritous, as more in Old People than
Young.</p>

with the Gout before Marriage, or the uſe of
Venery, and yet the</hi> Roman <hi>Prieſts who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
Matrimony, are frequently troubled with
this Diſtemper.</hi> O ſtrange! What a mighty
ſtickler for the Church of <hi>England?</hi> That

                     <p>Page 28. He ſays, <hi>Fifthly, Overmuch Sleep,</hi>
and to explain how <hi>overmuch Sleep</hi> does Gouty
People ſo much prejudice, he tells us, that
his Worthy Friend Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> hath made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that the Nervous Fibres, during Sleep,
are relaxed, and receive a large quantity of
Nutritious Juice, the Superfluities of which
are thrown off when awake, <hi>but when we
ſleep too long, ſo much is heaped up, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cannot throw off the Excrementitious Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi>
Page 30. This is the ſubſtance of
what fills part of his 28th, 29th, 30th and
moſt of the 31ſt Page only repeated in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Form three or four times over: I ſhall
not here diſpute, what he inſerts as Dr. <hi>Cole</hi>'s
Opinion, but ſhall ſhew, that granting it were
true, it would not be of any ſervice to him;
for as it is remarkable in that Obſervation of
Dr. <hi>Lowers,</hi> that Tranſpiration is much more
plentiful when we ſleep, than when we are
awake; and more particularly may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103742:94"/>
by any Ingenious Gentlemen, that more
of the ſubſtance of our Bodies is conſumed by
lying in Bed three Days, than we can reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in ſix; ſo it evidently from thence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that Alkalies are not the cauſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers;
becauſe it Alkalies were, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to what Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> ſaid, a little before,
Sleeping much, would cure the Diſtemper;
for he there would have that Juice that is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
off by Sweat, to be Alkaly, and <hi>Page 24.</hi>
ſays, moiſt Air does harm, by hindring the
Evacuation of that Alkaly; but if that were
true, the more we ſleep, the leſs ſubject we
ſhould be to the Gout, becauſe more of that
Alkaline Humour would be carried off, by
Inſenſible Tranſpiration, and conſequently
we muſt be induced to believe, that the Blood
is made more dull and groſs, for want of
Moiſture and Alkalies to dilute it; and it
would be more reaſonable to ſay, that the
reaſon, why People are ſo ſluggiſh after ſo
much Sleep, is, becauſe the Humours are more
groſs and thick, and circulate through the
parts with leſs eaſe, ſo much alkalized Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
being carried off by Sweat in Sleep, and
the groſs parts being left behind, in which
Acids abound. But one may ſee, that not
only Alkalies turn Acid, and Acids Alkalies,
to do him a kindneſs, but when he hath a
mind. Tranſpiration being ſtoped, promotes
the Gout, <hi>Page 24.</hi> But now in contradiction
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103742:94"/>
to that, Sweating much, hath the ſame effect;
ſo that his Alkaly is ſo miſchievous, that
whether it be in the Body or not, it hath the
ſame Effects there.</p>
                     <p>Page 31. He ſays, <hi>Sixthly, Overmuch Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Faſting, and Study, and Sorrow, and
Care, and much Labour—occaſions the Gout,
—the Nerves and nervous Fibres being kept
in a ſtate of Laxity too long, by being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
with ſlimy moist Particles.</hi> Here he
hath coupled no leſs than ſix words in a
Gang, with a whole Troop of <hi>and's</hi> to link
them together, perhaps in Imitation of, and
Compliance with, a late Act of Parliament, in
which it was ordered, that not above ſix
Horſes ſhould be linked together in Service,
upon the High Road, but whether that was
his reaſon or not, I ſhall here take notice,
that it being allowed, that the <hi>Fibres are
overcharged with a ſlimy Moiſture,</hi> proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to his purpoſe, but againſt him; for
ſince I have already ſo plainly ſhewn, that
Acids are the cauſe of Coagulations, and
that Alkalies are not, it muſt needs follow,
that the cauſe of that ſlimy Juice is acid;
and that Acids do cauſe Coagulations, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
plain, by applying of Vitriolick Acids
to ſtop Bleeding, which preſently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs
a ſmall Orifice, by coagulating the
Blood.</p>

Page 32. He ſays, <hi>Seventhly, Overmuch Rest
and Eaſe do greatly contribute towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
this Diſtemper,</hi> &amp;c. And then he ſays
<hi>Eighthly, Sudden Rest and expoſing the Body
to cold or moist Seaſons.</hi> And then <hi>Page 33.
Ninthly, A total bearing off of any accuſtomed
Exerciſe.</hi> But his <hi>Seventhly</hi> and <hi>Ninthly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and what he ſays <hi>Eighthly;</hi> but the ſame

and I can ſee no reaſon why his <hi>Tenthly</hi> ſhould

the Feet too hot, or too cold, would</hi> not influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

ſo far as <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> ſince what he ſaid, might
be comprized under ſix Heads anſwerable to
the ſix <hi>Non-naturals:</hi> But I remember <hi>Page 24.
the Devil turned Hydra,</hi> and ſo he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to give his Hydra, as many Heads as
he could, tho they were all like one another,
and perhaps, he did it, to imitate Nature in
the forming of that Creature.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> Since an odd Number is
lucky, let's ſee how Fortunate he is with it.
Page 34. The <hi>ſtopping of any uſual Evacuation,
as the Monthly Courſes in Women, and a Flux

Here according to his uſual Failings, and his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103742:95"/>
laudable Cuſtom of contradicting himſelf,
and miſtaking his own meaning, he is ſafe;
but hath the ill Fortune to miſtake in another
Method, and judiciouſly takes the Cauſe for
the Effect; for the ſtopping of the Courſes
and Hemorrhoids, is not the cauſe of the
Gout, but that vicid acid Juice, that cauſes
the Gout, alſo cauſes the obſtructions of
Courſes and Hemorrhoids; for as long as
the Blood is in a Natural State, the Courſes
never are obſtructed, but when it is thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Acids, it obſtructs in thoſe parts; ſo
that that vicid Matter which cauſes the Gout,
alſo precedes a ſtoppage of the Courſes, and
cauſes both.</p>
                     <p>Having ſhewed you how he hath furniſhed
his Hydra with eleven Heads, he now comes
to another, and ſays, <hi>Secondly, That the

great ſign that he abominates Repetitions,
ſince this hath been repeated in almoſt every
Page of his Book; and I have ſo often ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that theſe Diſtempers proceed from Acids,
that ſhould I repeat what I have ſo often
confuted, it would be but unneceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition:
I ſhall therefore refer the Reader
to what hath gone before.</p>

Page 35. He ſays, <hi>It will raiſe ones Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to ſee how we have groped in the dark
for want of making Experiments. I have often
found the quantity of Alkaly that is obtained
from the Blood of People labouring under a Fit
of the Gout, to exceed that obtainable from Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in a ſtate of Health.</hi> Now ſuppoſing this
were true, and I only ſuppoſe it; (for he that
hath told ſo many Untruths in his <hi>Novum Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Chirurgicum,</hi> may very well be ſuſpected
any thing that he ſays;) ſtill Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi>
can by no means leave off his groping in the
Dark, and ſhewing People that he's got out
of his way, in a thing he does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;
for did he underſtand common Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
nay, or what he ſaid himſelf, he would
know, that the more Acids there are in the
Blood, the more Spirits are drawn from it:
And firſt to ſatisfie him, if any thing that's
Reaſon will ſatisfie him, I ſhall do it from his
own Words, for in his Appendix to his Eſſay
of Alkaly and Acid, he ſays, All Herbs abound
with Acid; yet moſt of them are known to
yield a conſiderable quantity of Alkalious
Salt; and did he but know what common
Diſtillers obſerve, he would then learn a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why the Blood yields moſt of that he
calls Alkaly, when it moſt abounds with
Acid, for I have often taken notice, and it is
the common Practice of Diſtillers, who draw
Spirits from Brewed Wort, that the ſowerer
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103742:96"/>
it is, the more Spirits it yields; whereas if
they Diſtil it ſweet, it affords very little,
and the reaſon of it is plain, becauſe when
the Blood is ſweet, its Parts are more ſmooth
and alkalizated, according to him; but when
the Texture of that ſweet Maſs is altered,
and it degenerates into an acid Maſs, whoſe
parts are ſharp, thoſe ſharper Particles being
raiſed up by Diſtillation, form a Spirit which
affects our Taſte more ſenſibly; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Depreſſed Spirits eaſily fly away, this
more groſs and compacter Acid incorporates
with leſs loſs, than if the Matter from whence
it is drawn, were more volatile; ſo that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
upon what uncertainty Men draw Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
from chymically analizing the Blood,
where the leaſt alteration in the Maſs of
Blood, makes ſo great difference in the Spirit,
that is drawn from it: And here, becauſe I
would have Gentlemen ſatisfied that his ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
is of no uſe, I deſire they would but
enquire of Diſtillers, whether in diſtilling of
Wort to get a Spirit from it, it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to let it be a little ſowre, which when
they know, they will alſo know, what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
Agent the Fire it ſelf is; for what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Effects hath it upon the leaſt alteration
of the modification of that ſubſtance, it works
upon; and we ſee then, what a Mathematical
Demonſtrator Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> is, who is more
ignorant than Common Diſtillers, and what
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103742:97"/>
a fit Man is this, to draw Concluſions from
Experiments that he does not underſtand.</p>
                     <p>Page 36. He asks, <hi>What is this Cretaceous
Body, but a Collection of Homogeneous Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles?
I ſay of one determinate Figure, by a
Collection of Particles reaſon that the fire won't
totally deſtroy its Texture, which were it a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
compoſed of Particles of different ſizes and
figures (which is that we Chymiſts call hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous)
and the fire would deſtroy it.</hi> What
this cretaceous Subſtance is, I have before
told him, and how it is made up of a great
many acid Particles, lodged in a Mucus, and
hardned into the form of a Stone; but for
his Explanation of homogeneous and hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
Particles, it appears, that he does
not underſtand what is meant by homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
nor what by heterogeneous; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall tell him that a Liquor is called
homogeneous, not becauſe it is made up of
Particles of <hi>one determinate figure,</hi> ſince in
the Language of the Chymiſts, a Liquor
which is made up of Particles of a different
ſhape and ſize, may be homogeneous, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is ſimple, or ſo compounded, as to
agree with that Body, of which it is ſaid to
make a part; and ſo, that the Liquor, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
compound or ſimple, exactly ſuits in all
Circumſtances, that Body with which it is
mixed; and ſo the Blood, which is made
up of ſeveral Principals, if it be in a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103742:97"/>
Natural State, and of a right Texture, is
called homogeneous; but if another Liquor
be mixed with it, which is not exactly ſo
modified; tho it be a compound Body, yet it
is not called heterogeneous, in reſpect of the
different Ingredients, of which it is made up;
but becauſe it is not exactly like Blood in
all Circumſtances, in reſpect of Blood, it is
called heterogeneous; and this he would have
underſtood, had he known the derivation of
thoſe two Words, for homogeneous comes
from <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, which is to ſay of a like
kind, and heterogeneous from <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>,
of another kind; ſo that every Body is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous,
in reſpect of it ſelf, and its own
Kind, and every homogenous Body is hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous,
in reſpect of another kind. But
he ſays, <hi>Were it of Particles of a different
kind, fire would deſtroy it;</hi> but he is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
for the different Texture of Gold, Iron
and Braſs, does not make them more eaſily
diſſolve, tho they were mixed together, for
a Body never the more eaſily diſſolves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is a compound; every one of theſe
Bodies requiring as much force to diſſolve
them, whether mixed or not.</p>
                     <p>Having miſtaken the Meaning of theſe two
Words, from <hi>Page 36.</hi> he goes on to <hi>Page 38.</hi>
to make the miſtake a little more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
all along he proceeds to repeat what he
hath ſeveral times doubled and trebled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103742:98"/>
and all to tell People, that Alkalies are
the Cauſe of the Gout; but tho this be the
Gentleman that <hi>abominates Tautologies,</hi> he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knew he had often repeated this ſtuff
before, or hath an extraordinary bad Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
but tho he ſo eaſily forgot, that he
had ſaid the ſame things before, I think I
have ſufficiently anſwered them, and made it
fully appear, that what he hath ſaid all along
in defence of his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and in explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Diſtemper, is ſo far from proving
the Diſtemper to proceed from Alkalies,
that all he hath hitherto ſaid, is very
ſtrong and evident proof that it proceeds
from Acids.</p>
                     <p>But here I had almoſt paſſed by a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Piece of his Scholarſhip, and which
ſhews him to be a mighty Man for Antiquity:
A Man of a vaſte Soul, and of a ſtrong
Comprehenſion, <hi>Page 40.</hi> He ſays, <hi>The
Antient</hi> Romans—<hi>feigned two Goddeſſes,
the one called</hi> Volupia, <hi>the Goddeſs of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
the other</hi> Angeronia <hi>the Goddeſs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
Names fitted to their Natures, and the
Prieſts of</hi> Angeronia <hi>did ſerve at the Altar of</hi>
Volupia, <hi>to ſignifie that in this Life Pleaſure
and Sorrow were mixed together.</hi> But what's
this Goddeſs to the Gout, truly nothing at
all, but to ſhew what a great Lump of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
he had caſt up.</p>

Page 41. He ſays, <hi>I ſhall continue to aſſert,
that the Excrements of our Bodies are all Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious,
ſuch as Sweat, Tears,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but what is
voided by Stool, is not properly to be called the
Excrements of our Bodies, but the Excrements
of our Food.</hi> O admirable! What a piece of
Wit hath Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> laid here? But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his Wit, it will do him very
little Service, for I am afraid he hath ſo
much, he does not know how to uſe it, which
is obſerved in Calves-Heads, where a great
deal of Brains is found, but no Ingenuity;
for by the ſame reaſon, he ſays Stools are
the Excrements of Food, and not of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
Sweat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be ſaid not to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
of the Body, but of the Blood;
but that Sweat and Tears are not Alkalies, but
Acids, any Body that hath acquaintance with
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi>'s Goddeſs <hi>Angerona,</hi> may taſte
Tears evidently taſting Salt; and likewiſe
when People ſweat much, their Sweat does
not only taſte Salt, but People that work
hard, have a ſtrong ſowre Smell about them,
when their Heads ſweat much, which are
ſufficient proofs, that Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and <hi>Angerona</hi> hath done him very little
Service.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have gone through all that Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
hath ſaid, relating to the cauſe of the
Gout; from which, I think I have made it
plain, that in every particular, he is egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103742:99"/>
miſtaken; and I have not only ſhewed,
that he is miſtaken, but that what he alledges
in his own Defence, is ſtrong Proof againſt
him; and I have alſo added a great many plain
and obvious Obſervations, whereby it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
how little he underſtands what he hath
gone about; and as he hath oft been bold to
tell Learned Men, they grope in the Dark, ſo
it now appears how miſerably he is loſt in it;
which I hope is ſo evident, that Gentlemen
will be no longer impoſed upon by him, tho
he make his Pretences with never ſo much
Impudence, ſince the Method he takes is ſo
pernicious; and, as I have ſhewed from his
own words, increaſes the Diſtemper, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinates
its Cure.</p>

muſt not only be very falſe, but dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to Mankind, and of very ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
but ſince I have gone ſo far, with
no other deſign but to lay open his Faults the
clearer, that Gentlemen might be forewarned
how much they hazard their Health, if not
their Lives, by putting themſelves in ſuch
Hands; ſo, that they may be, if poſſible,
more fully convinced, what danger they lay
themſelves open to by ſo doing; I ſhall for
their further ſatisfaction, ſhew them the ill
Conſequences of his Practice, by laying open
its Faults there committed.</p>
                     <p>The remaining part of his Book is made
up of three parts, the firſt he calls the Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick
Cure, the ſecond is levelled againſt
Rational Practice, and the third is to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
his own ill Practice, which I ſhall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103742:100"/>
in the order he hath laid them in; and
firſt I ſhall obſerve his wonderful Dietetick
Rules: Where,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſays, Page 44. <hi>It is ſaid by ſome
Body, that</hi> plus Aere quam cibo vivimus, <hi>we
live more by Air than Meat, and that Air doth
aſſist in the Nutrition of Animal Bodies; the
famous Inſtance of Vipers, ſo well known, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to evince; for let a young Viper be put
into a Glaſs Receiver, and let the Receiver be
covered over with a Bladder with holes pricked
in it, and the Viper will become as large and
fat as if it were in the open Fields.</hi> What the
deſign of this part of his Dieteticks is, he beſt
knows; I for my part can't tell what he would
have by his inſtance, <hi>we live more by Air than
Meat,</hi> except he would have People to eat no
Meat, but gape for Wind continually; but
why breathing of Air is ſo neceſſary, I have
elſewhere ſhewed in my <hi>Treatiſe of the Heat
of the Blood, and of the Uſe of the Lungs,</hi> and
that People cannot live without Meat, a little
Experience tells them. But he hath given an
Inſtance of a Viper, that does not only live
without Meat, but grows fat; but to what
purpoſe does he mention this, except he
would perſuade his Patients they can live
better without Meat, than with it; ſure he
would not perſuade his Gouty Patients to be
cloſed up in Receivers, as the Viper was;
but if he would, they are a little too cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103742:100"/>
for him yet, I doubt not; and how much
ſoever he can impoſe upon them with his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
they will ſooner be pinned up in a
Coffin by his Medicines, than cloſed in a
Glaſs Receiver to ſuck Air, till he hath been
in it himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Page 45. He ſays, <hi>People who are troubled
with the Gout, ſhould endeavour to live in a clear
and most ſerene Air, that poſſibly they can,
and avoid that which is thick and foggy and full
of Extraneous Particles.</hi> That a clear Air is
better than a foggy one is no news of his find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, it being always delivered in Diete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Rules; but would he have Gentlemen to
overrun their Countries? Should they go
into <hi>France,</hi> or ſome warmer Country, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they would be leſs troubled with it; but
this is ſuch a piece of old Advice, that few
can take, and therefore he might have left it
in thoſe Books he found it in, where it was
deliver'd with Judgment and Learning.</p>
                     <p>All that he further ſays from <hi>Page 46.</hi> to
50, is but a Reduction to ſix Heads, what
in the Chapter before to make his <hi>Hydra</hi>
more formidable, he extended to Eleventhly;
and as what was there contained, was ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Blunders and Marks of his Ignorance, in
reckoning up the Miſuſes of Non-Naturals:
ſo here he repeats thoſe Faults in leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
and extenuated by extending them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in falſely, and as ſimply preſcribing Non-Naturals;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103742:101"/>
which, tho he had the Dieteticks
of Judicious and Learned Men writ ready to
his Hand, yet fancying himſelf a great and able
Man, he muſt needs mould them anew, and
turn them into his own ſimple Form, that he
might interpoſe two or three Sentences to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the uſe of Acids; but I having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſhew'd the dangerous Conſequences of
the uſe of Acids, and that, even according to
his own ſuppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Blood
would be coagulated by the uſe of Acids, and
conſequently the Diſtemper increaſed, I hope
Gentlemen will be ſo cautious of their own
Safety, as not to be miſguided by ſuch a
Man, who throughout his Book hath ſo
egregiouſly given us laſting Patterns of his
Ignorance.</p>

                     <p>I Come now to his Third Chapter, which
is irrationally levelled againſt all judicious
and experienced Practice; where from <hi>Page
50,</hi> to 58. he hath ſet down a Method which
was taken with Sir <hi>J. G.</hi> and <hi>Page 58.</hi> He ſays
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103742:101"/>
—<hi>Inſtead of being any way ſerviceable, it
exaſperated the Symptoms:</hi> But I here leave
it to the Conſideration of thoſe Ingenious
Gentlemen who are troubled with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
ſince they, by dreadful Experience
find, that when they take Medicines, the
Symptoms are almoſt Intolerable, whether it
be not more reaſonable to think the violence
of thoſe Symptoms proceeded from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Diſtemper; ſince I have ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made it appear, all along in anſwer to his
Books, that Acids are the Cauſes of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper;
and what more plain and obvious
an Experiment can there be, to prove the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
of uſing Alkalies in the Cure of
this Diſtemper, than that which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> by applying Vinegar it
ſelf to a freſh Wound, and at the ſame time,
to another, Vinegar whoſe Acrimony is dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the uſe of Chalk, or ſome other Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for if the ſtrength of ſo ſharp a Liquor as
Vinegar, is taken off by the mixture of Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this is the ſtrongeſt and plaineſt proof in
the World, that Alkalies are very uſeful in
the Gout, and always to be made uſe of by
Rational Phyſicians, ſince I have ſo evidently
and beyond Rational Contradiction proved,
that the Gout proceeds from Acids; for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies
do not only take off the Acrimony of
that Humour, which irritates the ſenſible
Parts, but alſo by abſorbing part of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103742:102"/>
Acid, attenuates that matter,
which by coagulating the Humour, fixes it
in the part affected, and conſeqently diſpoſe
that Matter to be abſorbed into the fluid Maſs
of Blood again, to be carried off by proper
Excretories, ſo that nothing can be plainer,
than that the uſe of Alkalies in the Gout, is
highly reaſonable, ſince it ſo evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
from ſo many Inſtances, as I have
throughout this Book given, that Acids cauſe
Coagulations, and conſequently are to be
taken off and corrected by the proper Uſe of
Alkalies.</p>
                     <p>Page 58. He ſays, <hi>The Medicines here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
are thoſe that are generally uſed by most
Phyſicians; and if any Body ever received Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by them, I dare be Burn'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
ever Men ſhould have ſuch dull Phanſies, as not
to vary from a Method that hath never once
ſtood them in any ſtead, looks very odd. And
as for Alkalious Medicines in general, I dare
be poſitive that they never yet cured any one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
but very frequently have done a great
deal of Miſchief, they being given in Foul Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</hi>
What miſchief they do when uſed
by abſurd Practicers, as himſelf, that know
not how to manage them; I don't now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute,
that being nothing at all to the Gout;
but ſince I have ſo manifeſtly made it appear,
that this Diſtemper proceeds from Acids, and
that Alkalies are of very great Uſe, I think it
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103742:102"/>
is all the Anſwer I need to give to this, that
the Medicines he preſcribes, are never given
by Rational Phyſicians, and never by Quacks,
without ruining Mens Conſtitutions in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time, and except he leaves of ſuch ill Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
he really deſerves what he ſo zealouſly
dares, <hi>viz.</hi> to be Burn'd; and I am amazed,
that this Man ſhould have ſuch a dull Fancy,
as all the reaſon in the World cannot perſuade
him from it, tho it be ſo very pernicious and
dangerous, and truly it looks odd enough to
uſe his elegant Expreſſion, that Peoples Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
muſt be ruined, to pleaſe his dull
Phanſie, and as for his Acid Medicines, I am
poſitive, they have ruined more Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
than he's aware of; but ſome People are
lead into their own Deſtruction by blind
Promiſes, which they know not how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
which is the reaſon he does ſo much
Miſchief.</p>
                     <p>Page 59. He ſays, <hi>In Chronical Diſtempers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſuch as the Gout,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>there poor Mortals are let
alone to languiſh under their Oppreſſion, and the
Phyſician—will be for putting the poor Wretch
into a Courſe of Alkalies, to correct thoſe luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant
Acid Particles, which he would fain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
his Patient that his Blood abounds with
(but yet he never found any ſuch thing there) to
the pauling of his Stomach, and exaſperating
his Diſtemper; and if ever the poor Patient
finds relief, it is from</hi> Opium, <hi>that is between
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103742:103"/>
whiles given; and if from that he hath any lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
intermiſſion of his pain, they are generally ſo
ungrateful, as not to ſet the Saddle upon the
right Horſe, to give the</hi> Opium <hi>its due, but
preſently hug themſelves, and cry, God a Mercy
Alkalies, and ſo go on with a</hi> repetatur pulv. è
chelis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now as this was to be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Rational Phyſicians, upon condition
that their Practice was falſe, ſo having all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
in anſwer to him made it appear, that
their Practice is Rational and Good; and that
his is falſe and erroneous; it muſt needs fall
to his own ſhare, and in his own words, <hi>to
lay the Saddle on the right Horſe,</hi> I muſt ſay,
in Chronical Diſtempers, ſuch as the Gout,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> there poor Mortals, are let alone to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
under their Oppreſſion, and Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
neither underſtanding their Diſtemper,
nor the true Method, that he ſhould take
with them, would be for putting the poor
Wretches into a Courſe of Acids; and would
fain perſuade his Patient, that his Blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with Alkalies, contrary to Truth and
Experience, to the Detriment of his Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
depreſſing of his Spirits, and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of his Diſtemper: And alas! If ever
the Patient he impoſes upon, finds relief, he
may thank God for it; and the ſtrength of
his Conſtitution, which helps to carry off,
and abate the Diſtemper: But what a tender
compaſſionate Creature is Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> who
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103742:103"/>
hath ſuch a tender Love for poor Gentlemen,
that will give him Money? For he is ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
at that <hi>Hydra!</hi> That Devil! That Gout,
that he calls it all the ill Names he can, and
hath ſuch eſteem for <hi>Opium,</hi> that gives them
all the eaſe they muſt hope for from him;
that he's offended they don't fix ſome Mark of
Honour upon it, it hath ſuch an excellent
ſtupifying Quality; and truly no Body knows
how much he is ingaged to be zealous for
the Honour of any thing, that relates to dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſtupidity, he hath ſo much of it
himſelf; and indeed he may well hug him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and cry, God a Mercy Stupidity! O,
the wonderful Effects of <hi>Opium,</hi> where A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids
would increaſe the Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>Page 60. He ſays—<hi>If we do not look about
us, and regain our Reputation, we may chance
to be laid aſide in other Diſtempers as well as
the Gout.</hi> This is a mighty conſiderable
piece, and ſhews the honeſt Endeavours of
the Man, who is ſo much afraid of being
laid aſide, that he uſes all the means he can
only to get Patients; and truly without this,
by his whole Writings one would gueſs, that
the Man only Huffs, and Contradicts, and
Writes, that People might think he hath
ſomething in him; but alas poor Man! He
hath ſo much ill luck along with it, that he
cannot long impoſe upon People, for thoſe
very Writings ſhew (according to the old
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103742:104"/>
Maxim, <hi>Nil dat quod in ſe non habet)</hi> that
he hath nothing at all in him, but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                     <p>Page 60. He ſays, <hi>What I have ſaid is not
to reproach the Phyſicians of our own Nation,
who are many of them as great Men as ever were
of the Profeſſion, and generally this City abounds
with ſuch, but my deſign is to undeceive Young
Phyſicians, who are impoſed upon by Foreign
Authors.</hi> But our Author Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> muſt
think himſelf a ſtrange ſort of a Wit, or the
Phyſicians in <hi>London</hi> very eaſily impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to be flattered with ſuch a dull pretence
as this; for if he did not reproach the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
of this City, who does he mean?
When Page 58. He ſays, <hi>The Medicines here
preſcribed, are thoſe that are generally uſed by
most Phyſicians;</hi> ſurely <hi>moſt Phyſicians</hi> muſt
needs comprize the generality of this City;
but if he would pretend only to undeceive
Young Phyſicians, why did he in his Preface
to this Book, call Phyſick a Scene of Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſince Young Phyſicians ſcarce kill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have Practice enough to be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Slaughter? But this is to let us know,
that he is Conſcious, that he hath laid that
to Phyſicians Charge, which properly belongs
to himſelf, and would thus ſtop their Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with this dry Complement. But did
he not ſay what he hath done was only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach—<hi>as
great Men as ever were of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103742:104"/>
Profeſſion,</hi> but <hi>thoſe that are impoſed upon by</hi>
Foreign Writers, why did he not then direct
his Book againſt thoſe Writers? But we muſt
give him leave to contradict himſelf, to ſay
and unſay, <hi>as odd as it looks,</hi> for his Head is
made up of nothing but ſhort Raptures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thought, or foreſight: Beſides, were
what he here ſays true, it had been his beſt
way to have gone amongſt his Adverſaries,
where by a total Conqueſt, he would have
got Credit, more than he muſt expect by
thus weakly expoſing himſelf amongſt Men
he hath nothing to ſay againſt, as he here
ſays.</p>
                     <p>Page 61. He goes on, <hi>If the Blood's abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Alkalious Particles, be the Primary,
or Fundamental Cauſe of the Gout, how can the
giving of Alkalies be of any Uſe? Of no other
Uſe than the throwing of a Company of dryed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots
upon a Houſe that is on fire, would be to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
the Flame; and whoever ſhould attempt
ſuch a thing, would, I ſuppoſe, be accounted
little leſs than a Mad-man.</hi> To this I anſwer,
that ſince I have ſo often made it appear, that
the Acidity of the <hi>Serum,</hi> from whence its
Viſcidity proceeds, is the cauſe of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
and it hath been plainly proved, by
evident Obſervations and Reaſons, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
more Acids, is the way to encreaſe the
Diſtemper: He alone is the Mad-man, that
can give no reaſon for what he does, but what
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103742:105"/>
is plainly contradictory to his own Practice;
but this is a ſtrange ſort of a Man, to call
all Phyſicians Mad-men. Page 61. and Page
58. He ſays, <hi>He will be Burn'd if ever they did
good;</hi> yet Page 60 ſays, <hi>He does not do it to
reproach the Phyſicians of our own Nation:</hi>
Whether does he talk like a Wiſe-man, or
like Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> now?</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Page 61.</hi> further to let the World know
that he hath a mighty Inſight into a Glover's
Trade, he tells a Story of a Philoſophical
Glover, from whence he ſeems to draw his
Concluſions, and upon which, one would
gueſs he had built his Hypotheſis; He ſays,—<hi>They
firſt throw their Skins into a Pit, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with a ſtrong Alkalious</hi> Lixivium, <hi>which
makes them in a manner rotten; afterwards
they make a ſtrong Acid Solution, into which
they throw their almoſt rotten Skins, which again
reduces them to their Texture; nay, makes them
firmer than they were at the firſt.</hi> Truly
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> was very happy in ſo Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
a Companion, for doubtleſs he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
wonderful hints, from one that was uſed
to grope Philoſophically in Lime-Pits; and
had he been Seven Years an Apprentice to
him, without queſtion, Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> would
have been a very notable Man at the Trade,
and would have handled Hides very Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically;
nay, and for ought I know, might have
made as Ingenious a Man at it, as Mr. <hi>Yardly,</hi>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:103742:105"/>
for he would have got wonderful Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by ſuch weighty Debates as would
have paſſed betwixt them two; but of what
advantage ſoever it might have been to him,
to have improved his Knowledge in that
Trade, I am ſure Mr. <hi>Yardly</hi>'s Story does
him little ſervice here; for it directly proves,
that Acids are moſt pernicious in the Gout,
and that Alkalies are the only Remedies to
be depended upon; for if Alkalies ſo ſoftned
the Skins, there is a great reaſon to hope that
they will alſo diſſolve, and ſoften thoſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
that ſwell the Parts affected, being
hardened and obſtructed there; but if Acids
will harden the Skins, when ſoft, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they muſt harden that Alkalious Matter,
lodged in the Gouty Parts, and ſo do more
harm by fixing it there. But,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page 62.</hi> He is happy, <hi>Quoniam ſucceſſus
ejus ſol vidit, oneres autem tellus operiret;</hi>
otherwiſe, becauſe thoſe he does not Kill,
think he Cures them, but thoſe he ſends
packing to another World, have not the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of telling their Friends the diſmal
Cauſe of their Departure, and how they were
ſent to another World by Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> his
Acids.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Page 62.</hi> to <hi>Page 67.</hi> he tells a long
Story of a Man that was troubled with an
<hi>Iliack</hi> Paſſion, but why that comes in this
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103742:106"/>
Chapter, I cannot tell, except he wanted
ſomething to fill it up with.</p>
                     <p>Page 67. he ſays,—<hi>The Skin abounds
with Receptory as well as Excretory Pores, which
I have frequently obſerved in the Skins of many
Animals, by the means of my Optick Glaſſes.</hi>
Really he ſeems to be mighty inquiſitive into
the Skins of Animals, ſince he hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Ingenious and Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Glover Mr. <hi>Yardly,</hi> but it ſeems he is not
content with Mr. <hi>Yardly</hi>'s Enquiry into Skins,
but hath got his Opticks to them, as if he
had a mind to be the Author of ſome new
Diſcovery, and would help his weak ſight
by Spectacles. But perhaps he remembered
that <hi>Malpigius</hi> and others, who had made
great Diſcoveries in Anatomy, made uſe of
Microſcopes; and ſo he being a great Man in
his own Conceit, muſt needs peep through a
Glaſs too; But to what purpoſe? Truly, <hi>he
hath diſcovered Receptory Pores as well as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory
Pores:</hi> But I ask him how he knew
which were Receptory Pores by looking at
them? Which is utterly impoſſible. And I
am afraid he hath ſtared ſo much on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
that he hath ſcarce looked enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
or he would have underſtood things a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better than he does; and I am ſorry to ſee
one that hath ſo little Reaſon, pretend to be
ſo ſaucy with all Learned Men, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo, but Dogmatical and Poſitive, where
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103742:106"/>
he ought to be humble, and repent of what
ill Practice he hath hitherto followed, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to impoſe upon Mankind.</p>

                     <p>I Come now laſt of all to his Method of <hi>Cure,</hi>
to undeceive theſe Ingenious Gentlemen,
that he hath hitherto impoſed upon; and
for their ſakes, I ſhall take pains to be a little
more large upon this Point, than I otherwiſe
need to be; for I having already ſhewn the
grand Blunders and Miſtakes of his Book,
and that he is ſo notoriouſly miſtaken in the
Cauſe of this Diſtemper, and in all he hath
ſaid relating to it; and alſo that the Method
he uſes is ſo far from curing, that it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the Diſtemper; it muſt be allowed, that
what he here delivers is falſe alſo; but to
make it more evidently appear that he is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
I ſhall take a brief View of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
And firſt,</p>
                     <p>Page 68. He ſays,—<hi>When my Patient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of a Crudity and Rawneſs of his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
with a Windy ſort of Diſtenſion and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103742:107"/>
of his Body, which are certain Arguments
of an approaching Fit: If he be of a Sanguine
Complexion, and a Plethorick Habit of Body,
I first of all preſcribe Blood letting, from 12
to 20 Ounces.</hi> Whether thoſe Gentlemen he
thus uſes find themſelves very much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or not, after ſuch immoderate Bleeding,
they themſelves are beſt Judges; but twenty
Ounces is a great deal too much to take at
one time, and if they find themſelves very
weak and faint after it, they had better fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Advice of able and Judicious Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
and not to exceed twelve Ounces; but
I am afraid thoſe that are ſo much impoſed
upon as to ſend for him, will be alſo prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon to ſubmit to his irrational Method,
and therefore it is in vain to adviſe them,
they muſt reap the dangerous Conſequences
of ſuch abſurd uſage, and may thank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for it; I ſhall only here forewarn them,
that when they <hi>find their Stomachs Raw,
and filled with Crudities,</hi> that is ſufficient to
ſatisfie them, that their Bodies abound with
Acids, all Crudities proceeding from Indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and Indigeſtion from too great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Acid Particles depreſſing and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering
the Alkalious Parts, by which
means, the Meat contained in the Stomach,
being not ſufficiently diſſolved and broke in
pieces, but (in the ſenſe of our Philoſophical
Glover and Mr. <hi>Colbatch)</hi> being too much
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103742:107"/>
hardned and kept to a Conſiſtence, remains
crude and undigeſted. But if nevertheleſs
they will let Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> pour in more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
and by encreaſing the Acidities of the
Blood, ſo oppreſs Nature, that ſhe cannot
powerfully expel the Morbifick Matter; all
that I can further ſay, is, that I am really
ſorry that Ingenious Gentlemen are ſo impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon by a Man that hath Impudence to
ſtare them in the Face, and contradict Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Experience. But to proceed;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page 69.</hi> and <hi>Page 72.</hi> amongſt his Acid
Medicines, as he calls them, an Hour or half
an Hour before Dinner, he orders his Patients
to take a Medicine made of <hi>Cremor Tartari,</hi>
and <hi>Tartar. Vitriolat.</hi> But for what end, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
to encreaſe the Diſtemper, I can ſcarce
imagine; for the Nature of <hi>Cremor Tartar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
being Purgative, it muſt needs do a great deal
of Miſchief, by raiſing the Periſtaltick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and forcing the Meat out of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
before it is digeſted, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way to fill the Blood with Crudities, and
conſequently to encreaſe the Diſtemper; ſo
that this Method, which forces their Meat out
of their Stomach undigeſted, and fills their
Blood with Crudities, muſt needs recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Mr. <hi>Colbatch;</hi> and he muſt needs be a
very fine Man, who hath Impudence to boaſt
of ſuch Abſurdities; really I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
him, and wonder that he hath ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103742:108"/>
as not to ruine People more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page 70.</hi> He orders the following Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
to be given for a Month twice a Day,
<hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>℞. Lapidis hoematitiſ. Unc. Semiſ. Crem.
Tartar. Unc. unam.</p>
                     <p>And really his wonderful Skill in Compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
conſidering the Advantage of Mr. <hi>Yard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>'s
Company, the Glover, and his own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bred an Apothecary, is not a little to be
admired; for there is no leſs than Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in this very Receipt; for as <hi>Crem. Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
is Purgative, ſo <hi>Lapis hoematitis</hi> is no leſs
a ſtopper of Purging, and to give one thing
to Purge, and another at the ſame time to
ſtop Purging, is as abſurd as if it were real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mr. <hi>Colbatch:</hi> And in his own Words,
Page 58. of this Treatiſe, <hi>That ever Men
ſhould have ſuch dull Fancies—looks very
odd,</hi> and ſhews the Ignorance of the Man ſo
plainly, that no Wiſe-man would ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
his Life in his Hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page 74, 75.</hi> and part of 76, He tells a
long Story out of <hi>Polemanus,</hi> but that being
nothing at all to the Gout, I ſhall take no
notice of it, but leave him to reſtore it to
<hi>Polemanus</hi> again, it being not able to do him
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103742:108"/>
any other Service, than to fill up two Pages
in his Book.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page 76.</hi> He ſays, <hi>I have hitherto but just
entered into the Porch,</hi> &amp;c. and really had he
gone no further than his Porch, he had gone
too far in ſuch a bad Way, for every Page,
except thoſe <hi>Polemanus</hi> hath taken poſſeſſion
of, are filled with a Recipe <hi>Crem. Tartar.</hi> and
<hi>Tartar. Vitriolat.</hi> over and over again, and all
the Elegancy that is to be obſerved in what
he ſays, is, that whereas ſometimes he puts
<hi>Crem. Tartar.</hi> before <hi>Tartar. Vitriolat.</hi> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the order is changed, and <hi>Tartar. Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olatum</hi>
comes before <hi>Crem. Tartar.</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he hath been ſo venterſome as to ſet
<hi>Crem. Tartar.</hi> by it ſelf, and this wonderful
Variety obſerved in his Compoſitions, muſt
needs argue him a profound Man indeed, and
he may well value himſelf upon it, for it is
nothing at all, but what Carters commonly
imitate, ſometimes ſetting one Horſe behind,
and ſometimes another.</p>
                     <p>But really this Porch appears to be nothing
but a Continuation of his Notorious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
and Blunders, and only differs from
the remaining part of his Book, as a Cloud
from Rain; for as his whole Book hitherto,
was nothing but a parcel of Rubbiſh, and
confuſed Blunders in Theory; he now is as
abſurd in Practiſe, and as the other only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
their Minds, this does their Bodies,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103742:109"/>
and makes them (to uſe his own Words in
Page 3. of this Treatiſe) <hi>run the Risk of loſing
their Lives, which to every Man is the valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
thing in the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Page 76. <hi>I ſhall now proceed to the Cure of
the Diſtemper it ſelf; the taming of this fierce
and angry Lyon, the expelling of the raging Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
the cutting off this Hydra's Heads.</hi> O
this Mighty Champion! That can tame the
fierceneſs of Lyons, expel raging Tyrants;
and (Page 24. of this Treatiſe) <hi>Poured whole
Battallions, armed with Spears and Launces,
upon a Devil, which is not to be cast out but by
Prayer and Faſting;</hi> yet did no more Service
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he might have had work
enough for his Battallions: What Puniſhment
does he deſerve? Is this the Man that wou'd
have a Thouſand a Year for to ſpend in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
from the Government? But yet he
is to be admired, for he hath almoſt equaled
<hi>Hercules</hi> in his Labours, only he is not come
to the <hi>Eugean Stables</hi> yet, but truly it is a
Pity, for I think that is the fitteſt Work for
him.</p>
                     <p>But it ſeems we are come through the
Porch, and muſt now proceed to the Cure,
and to ſee how this Champion performs his
Exploits, where we ſhall take a View of
the Aedifice this Porch hath led us to:
Where,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:103742:109"/>
Page 77. He ſays, <hi>I firſt of all—pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
Blood-letting, from twelve to twenty
Ounces.</hi> Strange! There is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Porch and the Houſe! They are
both alike exactly ſo far; and the ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that I gave him in his Porch, may ſerve
in his Parlor, ſo I ſhall not repeat it here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
but this is a mighty ſtep towards eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalizing
him for a Champion.</p>
                     <p>Page 78. He goes on with a <hi>Recipe, Crem.
Tartar</hi> and <hi>Tartar. Vitriolat.</hi> and all he further
ſays, to Page 80. is nothing but a repetition
of what he had ſaid before, when he had but
<hi>juſt entered into the Porch</hi> (as he terms it)
except a Plaiſter and a Salve to dabble their
Gouty Toes in, to as much Purpoſe as the
Magicians of old ſounded a Kettle to turn
the Courſe of the Sun, which would have
run its Courſe without all that noiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page 80. He ſays,</hi> Till the Violence of the
Pain is ſomewhat abated, I every Night give
an Opiate. <hi>Very ingeniouſly done! as long
as he finds his Acids will do no good, but
rather exaſperate the Diſtemper, he gives an
Opiate to dull the Pain, ſo that People can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
feel how much Miſchief he does them.
But here I ſhall make uſe of his own Words
again, Page 59. And ſay ſtill he</hi>—Will be
for putting the poor Wretch into a Courſe of
Acids, to correct Luxuriant Alkalies, which he
would fain perſwade his Patients, their Blood
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:103742:110"/>
abounds with, <hi>to the ſpoiling of their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
and</hi> exaſperating of their Diſtemper:
<hi>And now we may ſee,</hi> if ever the poor Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
finds any Relief, it is from the <hi>Opium</hi> he
gives every Night; and tho his Patients only
find Relief from the <hi>Opium,</hi> he is ſo Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as not to ſaddle the right Horſe, and give
the <hi>Opium</hi> its due, but preſently hugs himſelf
and crys, God a Mercy Acids, and ſo goes on
with a <hi>repetatur Crem. Tartar. &amp; Tartar. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Page 82. He ſays, <hi>When the Violence of
the Diſtemper is abated, then the foregoing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
must be altered, and the following Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
uſed.</hi> Truly Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> is a rare Man,
when the Diſtemper begins to go off, and he
dare give his Acids no longer to prolong the
Diſtemper, and to encreaſe the Number of
Fees: Then he lays them aſide, and gives a
few Medicines, that neither do good nor
harm, and which in anſwer to his Appendix
to his Eſſay, I have ſhewed, are, by no means
Acids, and have laid down the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Names
of them there; ſo that Ingenious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
may taſte them, and compare their Taſte
with <hi>Sevil</hi>-Oranges, which is an Acid; by
which means they will eaſily know whether
thoſe be like Oranges, but if Gentlemen
would be ſatisfied without ſo much trouble,
they may ask thoſe that are impoſed upon by
him, whether all the Medicines he gives taſte
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103742:110"/>
ſowre, or ſharp, which will ſatisfie them that
he is miſtaken.</p>
                     <p>Page 83. He ſays, <hi>Upon the going off of this
Diſtemper—a Courſe of Calybeats is very
proper, and rarely fails doing good Service.</hi>
Here Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> in the latter end of his
Treatiſe, hath taken care to confute all that
he ſaid before in this Chapter, moſt effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for as ſoon as he can get no more Money
by his Patients, he takes care to give them
Steel, Antimony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in his Eſſay of
Alkaly and Acids, I have proved to be Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:
Nay, he does not only give his Patients
thoſe Alkalies, but Caſtor, Nutmegs, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoms,
Cloves, and even Century and
Gentian, all or moſt of which, he ſets down
in Page 84, 85; and which the Reader may
find, in thoſe Receipts he laid down, and
condemned as Alkalies in the Chapter before
this; and there he ſays, <hi>He dare be Burn'd,
if they ever ſtood in any ſtead;</hi> yet here he
ſays, <hi>They rarely fail of doing good Service;</hi>
ſo that here I leave him to confute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But were his <hi>Doctrine of Acids and Alkalies</hi>
true, which I have ſo fairly ſhewed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be falſe, and were what he lays to the
Charge of all Rational Phyſicians true, theſe
Alkalies would cauſe the Diſtemper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
for if, as he ſaid before, the Gout pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from Alkalies, ſo great Quantities of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103742:111"/>
Alkalies as he here uſes, muſt needs increaſe
the Morbifick Matter, and cauſe a Relapſe;
but ſince they do not, we have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Diſtemper proceeds from Acids, and
that conſequently Acids would increaſe it. I
have now at the laſt, tho not without ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
taken a View of his Mighty Battalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which were to tame the Lyon, to drive
out the Tyrant, and to cut of the <hi>Hydra</hi>'s
Heads. But alas!</p>
                     <q>Parturiunt montes, naſcitur Ridiculus mus.</q>
                     <p>His Promiſes were large, and Pretenſions
great, but his Performance ſmall; and now I
cannot without Wonder and Amazement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Hero, the Mighty Man of War,
whoſe Battallions are nothing but <hi>Tartar. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolatum,
Cremor. Tartar. Oranges</hi> and <hi>Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
thoſe being all the Acid Medicines uſed
throughout his Book internally, all the reſt
being already in his Eſſay, and its Appendix
proved to be not at all Acids; and muſt this
Man huff and hector? Muſt this <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi>
miſlead and impoſe upon People? Muſt he
call Phyſicians Fools and Mad-men? What
Uſage does he deſerve? And what Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
too great for him?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But,</hi> Page 87. He ſays, <hi>Had I preſcribed
much and Violent Purgings, Vomits,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there was any danger, then People would
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103742:111"/>
have all the Reaſon in the World to be cautious
and fearful.</hi> It's true, they would have had
very great reaſon to be ſo; and tho their
Reaſons are not quite ſo great, yet the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is ſmall; for tho the Proverb only ſays,
<hi>It is ill venturing a Sword in a Mad-man's
Hands;</hi> yet People are certain, a Dagger,
tho not ſo large, is equally as dangerous,
ſince thoſe that are not armed againſt them,
may as ſoon be killed by one as the other;
ſo that in effect Acids are as dangerous as Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe they do miſchief, with this
difference, that the ill Effects of Vomits are
aſcribed to Vomiting, but the ill Effects of
Acids are attributed to the Violence of the
Diſtemper, and on one Conſideration, Acids
are more dangerous, becauſe People take
them without Suſpicion, and ruine their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
without their Knowledge, or a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of Caution; and as that Perſon is
moſt dangerous which is not known to be ſo,
ſo that Medicine is of the worſt ſort, whoſe
ill Effects are not taken notice of; for which
reaſons I have taken pains to run over his
Books, not becauſe I thought them worth
Conſideration, but to lay open the Miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Effects of ſuch abſurd Practice, that
Ingenious Gentlemen might be no longer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:103742:112"/>
From Page 88. to Page 96. He relates two
Stories, in which he gave his Acids; but
what he there ſays being only a Repetition
of the ſame Medicines he had given before,
what I have ſaid ſufficiently anſwers them.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, He ſays, he had his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in a Fit about a Month, in which I ſhall
obſerve that Page 93. He ſays, <hi>This was the
most dreadful Fit of the Gout I ever ſaw—
And had not the Medicines well ſuited with the
Diſtemper, to have abated the Violence of the
raging Pain, I believe he had certainly never
got over it.</hi> To uſe the Words of Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
the Champion, <hi>I believe he had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
never got over it,</hi> had not his Diſtemper
been very mild of it ſelf, for from what I have
already ſaid, it moſt evidently appears, the
Gout is cauſed by Acids, and conſequently
that they will be ſo far from abating the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
that they are the Cauſes of that
Pain; ſo that we have ſtrong reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Diſtemper being mild, was
increaſed by his Acids, for the Reaſons which
are up and down in this Book; and alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
notwithſtanding the Uſe of his Acids,
or rather by reaſon of them, it was the moſt
dreadful Fit that ever he ſaw, and continued
for a Month.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond Caſe, he thinks it not for
his Credit to tell how long the Diſtemper
continued; but from what hath gone before,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103742:112"/>
I am ſatisfied it would have gone off ſooner
without his <hi>Crem. Tartar.</hi> and <hi>Tartar. Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have now gone through his Treatiſe of
the Gout; and have fully laid open the
grand Blunders and Abſurdities, the Unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
Miſtakes, and Falſeneſs of every thing
he aſſerts throughout his Book; and have
proved, by plain Experiments and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
both that the Foundation of his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
is falſe, thoſe Experiments that he builds
upon, being ſtrong Proof againſt him; and
alſo, that the Practice he builds upon that
Foundation, is alſo Abſurd and Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                     <p>I might now go on to his next and laſt
Book, wherein he further aſſerts his <hi>Doctrine
of Alkalies and Acids;</hi> but the latter end of
this Book containing a Relation of Fevers, I
ſhall firſt make ſome brief Remarks upon the
ſame.</p>
                     <p>And here all that I need to take notice of
is, that whatever Credit may be got by the
Uſe of Acids in Fevers, is not to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him; it having always been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Practice of Phyſicians, to uſe Acids in
Fevers, except Malignant, in which Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Reaſon pleads againſt him; ſo that
did he lay down any thing, as to the Cauſe
or Cure of Malignant Fevers, by Acids, I
ſhould lay open his Ignorance by Reaſon, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103742:113"/>
back my Reaſons with the ſucceſs of Alkaly
uſed in thoſe Diſtempers, by Phyſicians, for
above an hundred Years.</p>
                     <p>But ſince here he only gives the Hiſtory of
five Perſons, in which he hath the liberty to
tell as many Falſities as he did in his <hi>Novum
Lumen Chirurgicum;</hi> and ſince he only tells
how he managed thoſe Patients, without
laying down the Reaſons of thoſe Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and may ſay what he will, Truth or
Falſities, as to the ſucceſs of his Medicines;
all that I ſhall ſay to theſe is, That ſince all
that we have to judge of in theſe Caſes, is,
his own Account of himſelf, which may be
very likely falſe, ſince we have found him
notoriouſly guilty of ſuch Faults before, that
we have reaſon to ſuſpect him to give falſe
Account of Diſtempers now, and to make
them worſe than they were, to applaud him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
I ſay, all I need to obſerve, is, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities
in thoſe Methods he here lays down,
and how much the Patients might ſuffer by
his irregular Practice, and how injudiciouſly
and ignorantly he manages thoſe Acids, that
have all along been uſed in Fevers; only with
more Diſcretion, and Judgment, than one of
his Dullneſs can pretend to: This, I ſay,
might be the Subject of my Remarks, but as
he always affirms that he had good Succeſs,
and is afraid to tell the Perſons, leaſt he
ſhould be diſproved: I ſhall only ſay, that if
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103742:113"/>
they recovered, it was more to be attributed
to the Mildneſs of the Diſtemper, than his
Management; ſince he as an ill Painter, who
abuſes his Colours, makes an irregular Uſe
of Medicines, which by a prudent Hand,
might be of more uſe.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore in the next place proceed
to examine and lay open the Miſtakes and
Injudicious Blunders of his next Book, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo truly repreſented this, that Ingenious
Gentlemen may very eaſily be ſatisfied of the
Falſeneſs of his Aſſertions, and how egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
he hath impoſed upon Mankind; which
ſince it was writ for their ſakes, I hope they
will ſo far conſider, as may prevent them
from expoſing themſelves to his irregular U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
and the dreadful Conſequences of it.</p>
                     <p>But all that he ſays in his Attempt to prove
what Life is, being nothing but as if it were
incoherent Scraps, and broken Thoughts,
which ſeem to be partly ſtol'n from Dr. <hi>Willis;</hi>
I ſhall refer him for an Anſwer to my late lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

EXAMINATION
OF
Mr. John Colbatch
HIS
DOCTRINE of ACIDS
IN THE
Cure of Diſeaſes,
Further Aſſerted, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>I Come now to the laſt part of my Task;
and truly, were it not my ſole Deſign to
detect ſuch grand Errors, and to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Truth, eſtabliſhed by long Obſervations
of Ingenious and Learned Men, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by daily Experience, I ſhould never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with my ſelf, to ſpend any more time
with ſuch nauſeous and abominable Miſtakes,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103742:116"/>
as his Book abounds with, but for Truth's
ſake, and for the Good of thoſe that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon by him, I ſhall proceed to an
Examination of what is contained in this
Book.</p>
                  <p>And firſt I ſhall take notice that this Book
is made up of three Parts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A further Aſſertion of the Uſe of
Acids.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, An Attempt to prove what Life
is. And</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, An Account of Mr. <hi>Turner</hi>'s Caſe,
which I ſhall therefore examine in three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Chapters.</p>
                  <p>But before I proceed to an Examination of
his Book, I ſhall firſt take notice of ſome
things which are premiſed to the Reader;
where,</p>
                  <p>Page iii. He ſays, <hi>I am every Day peſtered
with Objection of one kind or another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſave my ſelf the labour of writing Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
of Letters every Poſt-Day, I have thought
fit to anſwer thoſe Objection that are worth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of in this publick manner.</hi> A very
fair Confeſſion upon my word! This I hope
will ſatisfie Ingenious Gentlemen; nay, and
all <hi>knowing Women,</hi> what a ſlippery Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis
Mr. <hi>John Colbatch,</hi> who was late Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
in <hi>Worceſter,</hi> hath advanced; for it
ſeems, not only thoſe that write againſt him,
are endeavouring to detect his Errors, but
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103742:116"/>
whole Pacquets of Letters come daily to
convince him; ſo that Gentlemen may ſee,
that his Hypotheſis is not only cryed down
by thoſe, which he would repreſent as his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
but a vaſt Number of his Private
Friends, are ſatisfied of his Faults; and
thoſe Letters, I hope, will be ſtronger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments;
becauſe, ſince they are private, they
cannot be thought to be writ out of a deſign
to expoſe, but to convince him: But he ſays,
<hi>He hath thought fit to anſwer thoſe Objections,</hi>
&amp;c. very cautiouſly done, ſince it was Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
that takes this Method; he does well to
think it only worth his while to anſwer thoſe
which he thinks he can deal with; and to
keep thoſe in private that are too hard for
him; but here I would adviſe thoſe that write
to him, to be cautious; for if it be Nonſence,
he'll expoſe them; if their Objections be
ſound, they loſe their labour; for he's reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not to be convinced by any means, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that as boldneſs in a bad Cauſe hath ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
him hitherto, ſo that is all he depends
on for the future.</p>
                  <p>Page vi, and vii. He ſays, <hi>I never yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make People Immortal, my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
having all terminated in this,</hi> viz. <hi>to be
ſerviceable to my fellow Creatures in diſtreſs as
much as I am able. The</hi> Wiſe-Man <hi>ſays, That
no Man hath Power in the Day of Death, and
that there is no diſcharge in that War: The Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103742:117"/>
of Life and Death being only in the Hands
of the Almighty.</hi> This is the ſecond time he
hath thought himſelf bound to Apologize for
the frequent Departures of his Patients; and,
God knows, not without need, for how ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
he may be to his Fellow Creatures,
I have already ſhew'd, <hi>viz.</hi> in haſtening the
Number of the Elect; and as it is never uſual
except upon the Death of Perſons, to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch ſtrains of Divinity, ſo I am induced
to believe, nothing elſe could bring him to
his Bible.</p>
                  <p>Page viii. After a Confeſſion of his own
Deficiency, He ſays, <hi>I dare almost be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that even in my own Time the Cudgels
will be taken up, and the Hypotheſis maintain'd
and aſſerted, by one who is able to go through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitch
with it, better than I can.</hi> To this I
ſay that let him be who he will that will take
up a Cudgel, I have taken up one; and tho
I won't be confident, yet I dare promiſe to
engage my ſelf his Opponent in this Cauſe,
being here he will have neither Truth nor
Reaſon on his ſide; but before I leave his
Preface, I cannot but take notice of a very
Philoſophical Word he here makes uſe of,
<hi>viz. Through Stitch;</hi> and here I make bold to
ask Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> one Queſtion, Whether
<hi>through</hi> would not have expreſſed as much
without <hi>ſtitch?</hi> Truly it would, but we muſt
remember, Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> hath had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:103742:117"/>
to be intimately acquainted with the
Philoſophical Glover Mr. <hi>Yardley,</hi> of whom
he makes an Honourable Mention in his
Treatiſe of the Gout; and no wonder that
amongſt the reſt of his Improvments in his
Critical Enquiry into the Skins, he learnt
this Learned Phraſe, <hi>Through-Stitch</hi> from him,
it being common for Glovers to <hi>Stitch
through and through again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having made theſe brief Remarks, to
give Ingenious Gentlemen a Light in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
from his own words, I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to examine what he ſays for a further
Aſſertion of the Uſe of Acids; and ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
firſt briefly take notice of the occaſion of
it; which is this: One Dr. <hi>Tuthill</hi> of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>
writ a Letter to Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> this laſt
Winter, dated <hi>Auguſt 9. 97.</hi> in which he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſome weak Objections, which Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
finding to be of no force, writ this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to; and in his Preface, dates it <hi>October</hi>
the <hi>8th. 1697.</hi> And in Anſwer to this again,
Mr. <hi>Tuthill</hi> hath writ about three Sheets in
Vindication of his Objections, where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
his own Weakneſs more than in this
Letter, bringing very weak or falſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in proof of what he had ill grounded
here; but as Mr. <hi>Tuthill</hi> was brought into
Print at the firſt, perhaps without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
ſo he now is forced to ſay ſomething in
Defence of what he might careleſly write to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103742:118"/>
Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> in a private Letter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is to be a little excuſed for the Faults
of his Letter; and conſequently <hi>what he
hath ſaid in this laſt Anſwer,</hi> may be <hi>thought</hi>
only as a Flouriſh, to repair or ſave his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
and truly had <hi>he</hi> not ſubmitted to uſe
mean and ſervile Flattery, to a Man that is
ſo far from deſerving <hi>ſuch</hi> Complements: I
ſhould have had a little better Opinion of
him, but to complement a Man, that is
more Ignorant than himſelf, and to call what
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> hath writ in this Book, Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Solutions; and to tell one that <hi>hath</hi>
endeavoured to impoſe upon all the World,
that all the World is obliged to him, looks
as if Mr. <hi>Tuthill</hi> had a Mind to flatter
Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> to ſtop <hi>his Mouth,</hi> leaſt he
ſhould ſpit at him again; and I rather believe
ſo, becauſe Mr. <hi>Tuthill</hi> in the beginning of
thoſe <hi>Sheets,</hi> ſays, <hi>he</hi> would not have writ
them, had <hi>he</hi> not been preſſed, and urged to
it by ſome Friends; and truly, one would
think by what <hi>he</hi> writes, that it was with
much ado ſqueez'd out of <hi>him,</hi> and like
Drops of Blood almoſt ſtuck by the way;
and <hi>he</hi> had done better, had not it been preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
out of him, becauſe it is a very bad
Sample of what is in <hi>him:</hi> But as the
Diſpute betwixt theſe two Warriours, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable,
ſo I ſhall paſs them by without
any other notice, than as they afforded me
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103742:118"/>
                     <hi>half an Hours Diverſion;</hi> for when I read
them I thought indeed they were very hard
matched, and complemented as prettily as a
Pedlar does on a Holiday, and could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them to nothing more properly, than to
two Drunken Men, who fight in the Dark,
and ſtrike at random, without underſtanding
what they are about, or giving one another
many Blows.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore in favour of Mr. <hi>Tuthill,</hi>
who, I think, was brought into the Scuffle
againſt his Will, examine what Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi>
here ſays in favour of what I have already
ſhewn to be notoriouſly falſe; and ſhall lay
open what he here ſays, ſo fairly, that it will,
inſtead of Vindicating what he ſaid before,
prove againſt him: The firſt thing that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it ſelf to be taken notice of, is this;</p>
                  <p>Page 4, 5. He ſays, <hi>Whilſt I was fairly
jogging on, in the ordinary Method of Practice,
a certain Gentleman recommended to me a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Acid, which he told me, I might rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Cure of ſome ſort of Fevers. When I
conſidered the Thing as an exalted Acid, I
could ſcarce give the leaſt Credit to what he ſaid
—However, conſidering the fatal Succeſs
that frequently attended the Uſe of Alkalies,
and Alexipharmicks (which, however, at that
time, I durſt not attribute to the Medicines,
but the Malignity of the Diſtempers) I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
upon the first Poor Patient I had in a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103742:119"/>
Fever, to try what the forementioned Acid
would do; and upon a Multitude of Tryals—
I found by my Acid, I could Cure moſt ſorts of
Fevers, much more effectually and certainly than
ever I could before, by the Means of Alkalies,
and Alexipharmicks. The Effects of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine—backed
with ſome other Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
put me upon thinking, that Fevers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diſtempers did not proceed from the
Blood's abounding with Acid Particles, but on
the contrary with Alkalious ones.</hi> Truly, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> may think, 'tis ſcarce to his
Advantage; for whatever Good he did,
with that Acid, it was not to be aſcribed to
him, but the Gentleman. But why ſhould
he not give Credit to it? Since he was jog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
on in the ordinary Method, for Acids
were always uſed in moſt ſorts of Fevers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his time, tho highly prejudicial in the
Gout, Rheumatiſm, Small-Pox, Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it ſeems he was as ignorant in
thoſe Days, as he is now; and moſt abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave them Alkalies, and Alexipharmicks,
which are never to be uſed in Fevers, except
Malignant; which I have more fully taken
notice of, in my Anſwer to his Book of the
Gout. But to proceed, it ſeems being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
by a Gentleman, he fell to uſe Acids,
as other Phyſicians did, and as long as he
kept within bounds, had the like ſucceſs;
but he at the laſt, finding that Phyſicians
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103742:119"/>
were in the right, and he had been all along
miſtaken; not only gave Acids in moſt Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
but tranſgreſſed the bounds of Reaſon
and Experience, and boldly gave Acids, in
Malignant Fevers; which by all the Learned
and Experienced Phyſicians, for an hundred
Years paſt, and alſo at this time, are known
to be very dangerous. But this was not all;
thoſe that are Ignorant fear nothing, becauſe
they are not apprehenſive of danger; he went
on boldly in a falſe way, and wittily drew
this Concluſion; Acids do good, and have
good Effects in Fevers, and therefore other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
proceed from Alkalies: Very ſtrange!
and worthy of Mr. <hi>John Colbatch;</hi> and it
muſt be a very great Specimen of his Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Judgment, for he might as well ſay,
Water will ſet a Houſe on Fire, becauſe Fire
will, as that Alkalies cauſe the Gout, Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm,
Small-Pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe they cauſe
ſome ſort of Fevers; were it allowed that
thoſe Fevers proceeded from Alkalies.</p>
                  <p>From Page 6. to Page 21. is filled up with
a Parcel of Stories, nothing at all to his
Purpoſe; but to tell us, that he hath diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Blood of eleven Perſons to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
but to get ſo much Spirit as will turn
Syrop of Violets green; and what Service
that will do him, I have already ſhew'd, <hi>viz.</hi>
that he does not truly aſcribe the Cauſe of the
Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to Alkalies, but that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:103742:120"/>
from Acids, and I ſhall make it appear
more fully by and by in its proper place; I
ſhall in the mean time take notice, that Page
21. <hi>It would be almoſt impoſſible for any Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Man, to make a ſufficient number of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
without the Aſſiſtance of the Publick,
which occaſioned me in the Preface to my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of the Gout, to propoſe a Publick Stock to
carry on this Work.</hi> O ſtrange! Has this
mighty Projector this Thought in his Head
yet? Sure it makes him very uneaſie, to ſee
the Publick not take notice of him? Alas!
Poor Man! It's a moſt Noble Acid that keeps
up his Spirits, or how would ſuch a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Champion diſpenſe with ſuch Slights? He
that in his Book of the Gout, has the ſole
Faculty of caſting out <hi>that Devil, which is not
to be caſt out without Prayer and Faſting;</hi> who
tamed the Raging <hi>Lyon,</hi> cut off the <hi>Hydra</hi>'s
Heads, and expelled the Mighty Tyrant:
Why are they not afraid of his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
                  <p>Page 23. He ſays, <hi>Now if ſuch a Subſtance
as this be not to be called an Alkaly (meaning
the Spirit which he draws from Blood) I ſhould
be glad to be informed what is.</hi> I ſhall not
here inform him, what Medicines are truly
called Acids, and what Alkalies: It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to ſhew, that he does not know, which
I have already done, ſince he calls Steel and
Antimony Acids, which have always been
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103742:120"/>
found to correct Acidities, and by their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
to be Alkalies; but he asks, whether
this Spirit be not an Alkaly? To this I ſhall
give him this brief Anſwer; That if all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
were either Alkalies or Acids, it would
be more properly called an Acid, than an
Alkaly; but ſince all Subſtances are not to
be claſſed under thoſe two Heads, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an Acid nor an Alkaly, and becauſe he
knows not what elſe to call it, I ſhall tell
him, he muſt call it a Spirit; and ſince it is
drawn from an Oily Subſtance the Blood
(according to what he ſays Page 7. of his
Appendix to his Eſſay of Alkalies and Acids)
it muſt conſequently be an Acid, all Oily
Subſtances, according to him, being Acids.
But he ſays, it is an Alkaly, becauſe it turns
Syrop of Violets Green; if for that reaſon it
were to be called an Alkaly, then what he
ſays in his Appendix, is not only prov'd falſe,
by what I have there ſaid, but by his own
Words here alſo; but that it may appear he
is miſtaken here alſo, I muſt put him in mind,
that Acids will turn Syrop of Violets Green,
as well as Alkalies, <hi>viz.</hi> Arſnick, and Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
the firſt of which I have proved to be
an Acid in his Appendix to his Eſſay, and the
latter in the beginning of his Book of the <hi>Gout,</hi>
and indeed it is the moſt unreaſonable thing
in the World, thence to conclude any thing
either to be an Acid or Alkaly, becauſe both
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:103742:121"/>
Alkalies and Acids will turn Syrop of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
Green; and we may not only obſerve
different Subſtances to have the ſame Effects
in reſpect of Colour, in this Experiment,
but even throughout Nature; for Aloes and
Cinnamon are much of the ſame colour, but
different in all other reſpects; Sugar and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate
are of the ſame colour, yet the one is
innocent, and the other ſtrong Poyſon; but
tho all are not to be eſteemed Alkalies, that
turn Syrop of Violets Green, yet it is certain,
a great many will; and I have therefore in
Anſwer to his Book of the Gout, granted,
That allowing the Doctrine of Acids and
Alkalies to be true (which is by no means)
his Experiment was good, and upon thoſe
Grounds I ſhewed alſo, that the Experiment
is very ſtrong proof againſt what he builds
upon it; I ſhall alſo here upon the ſame terms
grant, that this Spirit is an Alkaly, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſhew, that tho' it be allowed to be ſo, it
will prove againſt him, <hi>viz.</hi> that Acids are
the Cauſes of Diſtempers: In order to which
I ſhall further take notice, that Page 23. He
ſays, <hi>In examining the foregoing Experiments,
it plainly appears, that the Blood of People
labouring under the Diſtempers there mentioned,
does afford a much greater Quantity than that of
the Healthy Perſon.</hi> But this, I ſay, proves,
that there is a great deal more Acids in the
Blood of thoſe Diſtempered People, and does
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103742:121"/>
not at all prove, that there is more Alkalies;
for the Blood of Healthful People hath as
much Alkalies in it, as diſtempered Blood, as I
have ſhewed in anſwer to his Introduction,
in his Treatiſe of the Gout; and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Blood and Serum in reſpect of the
Diſtemper, is only this, that the diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Maſs abounds more plentifully with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
by which means it is more viſcous and
soapy, and is ſubject to thoſe Coagulations,
that healthful Peoples Blood is free from:
And this being already proved, the reaſon
why diſtempered Blood yields more of that
Spirit, than healthful Blood, is very plain,
from that Obſervation I, in another part of
my Anſwer to that Book, have laid down:
For I there obſerv'd, common Diſtillers, who
draw Inflamable Spirits from Wort, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that before it is ſowre, and degenerated
into an acid Liquor, it yields leſs Spirit than
after it hath acquired that acidity; thoſe acid
Particles being a more compact Subject for
the Fire to work upon; and as that Wort
yields more Spirit, the more it degenerates
from its Sweetneſs to an acid State; ſo the
ſweet Maſs of Blood, the more it is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with thoſe Acids, that cauſe it to coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate;
the more it yields of that Spirit;
the Volatile Parts of the Blood being made
ſharper by the Union of thoſe more compact
pointed Particles, and alſo being more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103742:122"/>
yoked together and kept from flying
away, by which means greater Quantities of
that Alkaly is raiſed by the Fire, and carried
off by Diſtillation.</p>
                  <p>All that is contained further in favour of
his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> from Pag. 24. to Pag. 29. is,
<hi>That the Fire produces no new Subſtances, which
were not exiſtent in Bodies before, and if any
one will demonſtrate ſuch a thing without Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
he will own himſelf his humble Servant.</hi>
How far he will be my humble Servant, I
value not, I would only deſire him to be
humble where he hath reaſon, and then he
would, like an honeſt Man, follow his Trade
again; for he cannot long make People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that giving two or three Medicines
without Reaſon or Judgment, is cutting off
<hi>Hydra's</hi> Heads, or performing any ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits;
and if he does not draw in his Horns
in a little time, he may expect, that Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gentlemen will be undeceiv'd, and laugh
at his Knight-Errantry; but if he hath a mind
to be my humble Servant, I ſhall demonſtrate
it to him from his own Words, that new
Subſtances are produced, which were not
exiſtent before, not only by Fire, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. For Page 12. He ſays, <hi>That Bodies of
very different Natures may and do receive Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
and increaſe from one and the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
which in it ſelf ſeems to be ſimple and
homogeneous:</hi> And this is what he had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:103742:122"/>
from Mr. <hi>Boyle;</hi> and that not only the
Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> but all Philoſophers
of any Note, have agreed, That tho Fire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
create a new Subſtance, yet by Fire the
Form of Matter may be ſo changed and modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
anew, as to produce a new Subſtance out
of any Body, which in reſpect of its Form is a
new Body different from all others, and not
exiſting in that Body from whence it was
drawn; and I appeal to all thoſe Gentlemen
he hath ſo oft appeal'd to, whether thoſe
Subſtances, which he draws from Blood, by
analizing it, be not different in colour and
taſte from Blood it ſelf, from whence it is
drawn.</p>
                  <p>All that is further contained in what he
ſays from Page 27. to Page 32. is, <hi>That the
Inferences</hi> he <hi>draws from the Serum of the
Blood turning Syrop of Violets Green, prove the
Blood to abound with Alkalies;</hi> and to ſhew
that two or three, beſides himſelf, have uſed
the ſame Experiment to as little purpoſe as
he hath done. How far that Experiment
pleads againſt him, I have already ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhewn in the beginning of his Treatiſe of
the Gout, ſo that there is no need I ſhou'd
repeat it again ſo oft: And as for what he
ſays of Dr. <hi>Fran. Andre</hi> of <hi>Caen.</hi> and <hi>Swalve,</hi>
the ſame Anſwer I gave to him, will be an
Anſwer to them; ſo that all the Service theſe
two Doctors will do Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> is to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103742:123"/>
ſhew that the Experiment he there laid down
was none of his own, he only having bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
it from another Man, as much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as himſelf in this Point.</p>
                  <p>Page 34, 35. He ſays, <hi>That the Blood of
ſick People, in all or most Diſtempers, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with ſuch Particles, more than that of
thoſe that are in a State of Health; and if you
take an equal proportion of the Serum of the
Blood of a Healthy Perſon, and that of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in a Fever, Pleuriſie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and pour them
into equal quantities of Syrop of Violets of the
ſame Strength, you will find that whereon the
ſick Perſon's was poured, will be much greener
than the other; and if you commit the Blood
of a diſtempered and a healthful Perſon to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation,
the former will yield more Alkaly.</hi>
How diſtempered Blood comes to yield more
Spirit, I have already ſhewed, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe
there is more acid to inviſcate and embody
the Spirit, and how in ſome Caſes, as the
Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Serum of the Blood comes to
turn Syrop of Violets greener, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Diſtemper proceeds from Acids, I
ſhall here briefly explain; and to make it
more intelligible, we are to conſider, what
State the Maſs of Blood of a diſtempered
Perſon is in, taken collectively, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the whole, and how it differs from
healthful Blood; and here we may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that I obſerved before, that the Eſſential
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103742:123"/>
Difference betwixt healthful Blood, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered,
was that Viſcidity obſervable in
the whole Maſs of Humors; from whence it
appeared, that this Experiment had no power
in trying the different degrees of its Viſcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but only ſhewed the difference betwixt
the thin Serum, which our Author ſays, turns
Syrop of Violets greener, when diſtemper'd;
and as I there ſhewed of what little force his
Experiment was, except againſt himſelf, I
ſhall now ſhew, that tho it turns Syrop of
Violets greener than healthful Peoples Blood,
it is of no uſe to him; for we are to obſerve,
that whereever there are fiery acid Salts in a
State of Fluidity in the Blood, theſe meeting
with the Spirits at the Extremities of the
Veſſels, where the Blood and Spirits are
mixed together, cauſe a preternatural Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by which means the Volatile, and moſt
Spirituous parts, are put into a more brisk
and violent motion, than what is conſiſtent
with the Natural Temper of the Blood; and
thus accidentally being put into motion, too
much exagitate the Maſs of Blood, by which
means it's volatile parts are diſſolved; and
as the Learned Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> expreſſes it, carried
forth into a State of Fluidity or Exaltation, the
diſtempered Matter being partly or wholly
thrown off into ſome Part or the Habit of the
Body; but the coagulated diſtempered Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is not only thrown off by this preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:103742:124"/>
Ferment, ſeperating it from the purer
Maſs, and leaving it in theſe Parts; but the
Serum of the Blood is alſo, by that means,
more plentifully impregnated with thoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
Particles, which turn Syrop of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
green: From whence it appears, that
tho the Viſcidity which cauſes the coagulated
Serum to obſtruct, proceeds from Acids;
yet the volatile parts of the Blood being
thus accidentally exalted by fermenting with
more Spirituous Acids, accidentally cauſe the
Serum of the Blood of ſuch Perſons, to turn
Syrop of Violets greener than that of health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
People does.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> may have it put
into his Head, That if the Cauſe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
ſhould proceed from Acids; the
Alkalies thus exalted, would correct thoſe
Acids, and cure the Diſtemper without Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines:
To this I ſhould anſwer, that it
would, and does ſo; which is the reaſon ſo
many of thoſe Diſtempers go off without the
Aſſiſtance of Phyſick, that acid coagulated
Humour being at the laſt digeſted, and by
deſtroying the Acids, reduced to a State of
Tenuity, and as in a Pleuriſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Maſs
of Blood is apparently more clammy than
healthful Blood; ſo it is obſerved, that when
that acid that cauſes it thus to coagulate, is
conquered, it again becomes thin, and tho al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalious,
yet healthful, that Viſcidity being
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103742:124"/>
taken off, which cauſed the Diſtemper, as in
the Gout, Rheumatiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of acid be ſo much, that the volatile
Parts of the Blood thus exalted, cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power
it, then that is never conquered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the aſſiſtance of Medicines which correct
and carry off the Acidities of the Blood. But
to proceed;</p>
                  <p>Page 36. He ſays, <hi>If there were not a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Death within us, how is it poſſible for a
Man one Hour to be in a good State of Health,
and the very next to be expiring?</hi> What Mr.
<hi>Colbatch</hi> means by a Principle of Death, no
Body on this ſide the Grave can well tell;
for amongſt all the Philoſophy I have yet
read, I never heard of ſuch a Principle; but
Poor Man he writes like one that groped in
the Dark; and ſince all along throughout his
Books he hath been in it, we muſt not think
ſtrange that he is ſo now.</p>
                  <p>From Page 37<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Page 42, He makes a
long Speech, in which all that is contained,
is, <hi>That all the Alkalies in the Blood, are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement,
and are in the way to be carried off,
but being hindred by Obſtructions, or by taking
cold, and ſo preventing theſe Excrements from
being carried off.</hi> What Excrements are
Alkalies, according to his Notions,
and what are not, or whether any are, I
ſhall not now determine; but granting that
they all were Alkalies, I ſhall ſhew that thoſe
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103742:125"/>
Diſtempers are cauſed by Acids; for we muſt
take notice, that as long as this alkalizated
Serum is carried off, ſo long our Bodies are
healthful, and free from Diſtempers; but as
ſoon as this Alkaly is hindred from going
off, then our Bodies are diſtempered; from
whence it appears, that whatever hinders
that Alkaly from going off, is the Cauſe of
thoſe Diſtempers; which, he ſays, are either
Obſtructions, or taking Cold. As to the
firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Obſtructions: Whatever cauſes
Obſtructions, muſt hinder the Excrements
from going off that way; and that Alkalies
cannot cauſe thoſe Obſtructions, is plain,
becauſe all that goes off that way in a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
State, according to him, is Alkaly, and
yet does not obſtruct; ſo that all Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(if what he ſays were true) being either
Alkalies or Acids, from the firſt to the laſt it
appears, that Acids muſt cauſe thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
which cauſe the Diſtemper, and
that Acids will thicken and coagulate is plain
from his own Words; and alſo becauſe
taking Cold occaſions ſuch Obſtructions
as prevent the <hi>Alkaly</hi> from going off, which
taking Cold can no otherwiſe do, but by the
<hi>Acid Nitre</hi> of the Air coagulating and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
thoſe Humours: So that granting
the Excrements to be <hi>Alkalies,</hi> all Diſtempers
muſt proceed from <hi>Acids</hi> coagulating thoſe
<hi>Alkalies.</hi> And Mr. <hi>John Colbatch</hi> hath Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103742:125"/>
his Hypotheſis prettily; here we may
ſee what a penetrating Judgment he has, and
what vaſt ſhort Foreſight; And is not this a fit
Man to have <hi>Peoples Lives</hi> intruſted in his
Hands? How muſt he give Medicines with
any certainty as to the Event, who ſpeaks
thus without underſtanding the Conſequence
of his Words?</p>
                  <p>Page 42. He ſays, <hi>All Alkalies that I
know off, will preſently cauſe Rottenneſs and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction
in Animal Subſtances, as may be ſeen
in making of Glovers Leather, an Inſtance of
which I have given in my Tract of the Gout,</hi> &amp;c.
This truly is very ingeniouſly done, who
would ever have thought he could have kept
any thing in his Head ſo long, who through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Book hath been ſo forgetful; but to
ſpeak the Truth, he hath reaſon to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his Philoſophical Companion, who fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
him with ſuch a neat Phraſe as through-ſtitch
in the beginning of his Book, and
communicated to him alſo that Wonderful
Obſervation of the Skins of <hi>Animals;</hi> but
why will all Alkalies preſently cauſe Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs,
and we who are ſo full of Alkalies
live a great many Years, and are no more
Rotten than himſelf? But in his Preface to
the Gout, he hath obſerved, that when we
Die, our Fleſh preſently rots; but what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
is that to him? It only ſhews, that
in a Natural State, our Bodies ought to have
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:103742:126"/>
more Alkalies in them than Acids, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
if Alkalies Naturally abound in
our Bodies, Acids muſt be moſt prejudicial
which are quite contrary to the Natural,
Conſtitution of our Blood.</p>
                  <p>From Page 43 to Page 64, all he ſays
being an Attempt to prove, that Life is a
Flame and alſo what ſupplies it, I having
already in a late Treatiſe <hi>Of the Heat of the
Blood,</hi> and <hi>of the Uſe of the Lungs,</hi> made it
appear, in Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> his Opinion
(of which his ſeems to be but ſcraps) that there
is no ſuch Thing as Flame in the Blood, I ſhall
not here repeat, that but refer him and the
Reader to that Book for an Anſwer, and ſhall
here proceed to conſider what he further aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
in favour of Acids, all that is contained
in thoſe Pages being already anſwered.</p>
                  <p>From Page 64 to Page 89, his Book
is filled up with nothing but an Anſwer to
ſome Objections raiſed by Mr. <hi>Tuthil,</hi> but as
there is nothing Material either in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
or the Anſwers to them, they being
inconſiderable and ſimple I ſhall paſs them by,
and leave them two like Children to ſquabble
it out, ſince in ſuch Nonſenſe it is no great
matter which overcomes.</p>
                  <p>Page 90, Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> ſays, <hi>But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
Acids to be the most proper Medicines in
the World to eaſe Pain, as I believe they are,
yet it is not improbable but upon giving a ſmall
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103742:126"/>
Quantity of Acids in ſuch Caſes, where there
is a large Quantity of Alkaly lodged up in any
Part, ſo as to cauſe Pain, it may only in Part
diſſolve the Alkaly, which was more fixed, and
ſo by continuing the Uſe of the Acid, the Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would be perfectly diſſolved and extirpated,
and ſo the Pain would altogether vaniſh: But
Pain being ſometimes exaſperated, upon the
firſt giving them in too ſmall Quantities, has, I
doubt not, been one great Cauſe of deterring Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from proceeding in the Uſe of them.</hi> What
ſtronger Proof could be brought by any one
againſt Mr. <hi>John Colbatch</hi> then what Mr.
<hi>John Colbatch</hi> brings: For this confirms what
I ſaid againſt the Uſe of Acids in the Gout,
where I proved that thoſe Acid Medicines, in
the firſt Caſe he mentions did ſo exaſperate
the Pain as to make it the moſt terrible Fit he
ever ſaw, and now he himſelf confeſſes, that
Acids do really cauſe the Pain in the Gout to
be more ſharp; but then he ſays, the Acids
only cauſe pain by diſſolving the Alkaly, but
that the Acids do not cauſe Pain by diſſolving
the Alkalies is plain, becauſe Acids according
to what he ſaid in his Eſſay of Alkalies and
Acids, will not diſſolve but confirm the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of thoſe Coagulated Acids; for he there
ſays in his Chapter of the Gout, that by
drinking much Wine, the Alkalies of the Blood
Coagulating thoſe Acids, the Matter of the
Gout is increaſed; from whence as I before
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103742:127"/>
obſerved it follows that when his Acids come
to the Part affected and there mix with thoſe
Alkalies, the Alkalious will according to him
Coagulate the Acid, and conſequently inſtead
of diſſolving will increaſe the Obſtruction,
and that Acids are thus pernicious, is alſo
proved from what the Philoſophical Glover
Mr. <hi>Yardly</hi> communicated to him; for if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids
hardned the Skins that were ſoftned by
Alkalies, it therefore follows that Acids
will alſo hearden that coagulated Matter, and
that conſequently Alkalies are proper Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
to diſſolve it.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have gone over all that is Material
relating to a further Aſſertion of the Uſe of
Acids, and have ſhewed that all he ſaid is
falſe and ſo far from being a further Aſſertion
of what he hath ſaid before, that it is but
a Repetition of what he ſaid before in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Books, and now I have gone over all his
Books I cannot but reflect and think, that I
have ſpent a whole Month in ſuch intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Abſurdities as his Books are made up
with, and could almoſt condemn my ſelf
for ſpending ſo much time upon ſuch ſtuff,
were it not to undeceive that Part of the
World that is impoſed on by ſo Grand an
Emperick, a Man ignorant and unlearned in
Knowledge, dangerous and erroneous in
Practice, and now can any ingenious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
reflect on theſe grand Miſtakes,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103742:127"/>
notorious Blunders that his Books are
filled with, together with his Inſolence and
rude inſulting Behaviour, daring to caſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions
on the whole Learned World, I ſay
can they reflect on theſe things and not think
him very Vain and Impudent? What Uſage
muſt this Man deſerve? Who reproaches all
Phyſicians upon ſuch falſe Grounds, when
there is ſuch evident Proof that he is
miſerably Miſtaken, what Puniſhment great
enough and what Scorn and Contempt equal
to his Demerits?</p>
                  <p>But if Gentlemen love to be impoſed upon,
if they had rather retire into another World
and are fatigued with this; I ſhall not envy
them, in their choice of ſuch a Phyſician,
but pity their hard Fortune, nay if they
muſt needs admire him, I deſire they may, as
they value another World, before this; and
let them conſider what I have ſaid, and if they
can pardon ſuch Abſurdities, if they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
his Ignorance and dull Faults, if they
can look over ſo dark a Character as his, and
be pleaſed with it, and think well of ſuch a
Man, may they ever admire him till they find
the fatal Conſequences of ſuch Abſurd Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>

VINDICATION
OF
Dr. FRY of Oxford,
In a late
CASE
OF
Edmund Turner Eſquire, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>I Shall to cloſe up this Book laſt of all
proceed to a Vindication of that Learned
Dr. <hi>Fry,</hi> againſt the unreaſonable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> and ſhall
ſhew that in the caſe that they were concerned
in, Dr. <hi>Fry</hi> proceeded like a rational judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Man, and Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> like a mad Man
without Conſideration, Reaſon, or Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and here I ſhall not wholly tranſcribe
all the Paſſages he here relates, wherein it
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103742:128"/>
appears, that he who is made up of nothing
but Ignorance and Conceit, was Inſolent and
Sauſy towards a Man of no leſs Learning
and Judgment than Dr. <hi>Fry;</hi> but I ſhall draw
the Matter in as little Compaſs as I can, and
ſhall only take notice, tho' Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> here
hath the liberty to ſtate the Caſe according
to his own Mind, true or falſe, as it will beſt
ſerve his turn, yet it will be nothing at all
to his Credit but expoſe his weakneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.
The Caſe as he ſtates it was thus.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> night Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> with two
other Gentlemen ſate down to Drink and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
at it, till ſeven or eight next Morning
—at which time they all went to bed, the
other two Gentlemen lay in Bed the whole Day,
and eat nothing but Watergrewel; but Mr.
<hi>Turner</hi> in the Afternoon got up and eat boiled
Mutton, with a great deal of ſtrong Broth and
Muſhrooms in it, and drank plentifully both of
Wine and prodigious ſtrong Beer, and then
went to bed again and preſently fell a Sleep,
but early next Morning, he awaked in the moſt
dreadful condition imaginable. When I came
to him, his Circumstance were as follow;</p>
                  <p>He had a violent Pleuriſy and Peripneumony
upon him, a most ſharp Pain in his left ſide and
a prodigious ſhortneſs of Breath, he alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of a wonderful <hi>Nauſea,</hi> and Sickneſs of
his Stomach, and had a Fever upon him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:103742:129"/>
This was Mr. <hi>Turners</hi> Caſe as Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi>
ſtates it, and likely it might be true, but how
Madam <hi>Turner</hi> and her Relations will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> his Publiſhing, that
Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> killed himſelf with Drinking I
know not; but if ſhe's pleaſed with it, with
all my Heart. My Deſign being only to ſhew,
how like a Rational Phyſician Dr. <hi>Fry</hi> acted,
and how abſurdly Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> preſcribed, I
ſhall briefly take notice of the Cauſe of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
that it may more clearly appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them was in the right.</p>
                  <p>The Diſtemper then was a Pleuriſy joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with a <hi>Peripneumony</hi> and <hi>Nauſea</hi> at his
Stomach, now it being obſerved, that in all
Pleuritick Blood, the Maſs of Blood abounds
with ſizy clammy <hi>Serum,</hi> and that the Blood
it ſelf is alſo too thick, it is plain, that the
Obſtructions in the Pleuriſy muſt proceed
from that Viſcid Matter, and conſequently
from a mixture of Acids which cauſed that
Blood to Coagulate, which I have ſufficiently
made evident in Oppoſition to him through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Books, it being alſo obſerved that in
all <hi>Peripneumonies,</hi> the Lungs are inflam'd, and
it being moſt certain that thoſe Inflammations
proceed from hot fiery Particles, which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
through that Part. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that all
<hi>Nauſea</hi> in Surfeits proceed from ſomething
that lyes upon the Stomack, and affects it Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally,
we have Reaſon to believe, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103742:129"/>
that his Fever and Inflammation proceeded from
thoſe hot Liquors he had Drank, and that
the Obſtructions of <hi>Pleura</hi> was cauſed by that
Mutton which he eat; for his Stomach being
ſurfeited with Drink and unfit to digeſt what
he eat, and thoſe Crudities being carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with thoſe Liquors into the Capillary
Veſſels of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> would undoubtedly be
subject to Obſtruct there, and were, together
with the Liquors he drank, the Cauſe of his
Diſtemper, and as for his <hi>Nauſea</hi> it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Symptom after a Surfeit.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have briefly taken a view of the
cauſe of this Diſtemper and ſhall now with
all the Brevity, the Caſe will admit of, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to conſider whether of them took the
true Method to remove theſe Symptoms, and
for that end I ſhall take a View of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
preſcribed by each. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall
ſhew how Rationally and Judiciouſly Dr. <hi>Fry</hi>
ordered Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> which Method, had
it been continued, might undoubtedly have
ſaved his Life. The Medicines preſcribed
by Dr. <hi>Fry</hi> were according to Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> his
Account as follow;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For Mr.</hi> Turner Auguſt 31. 1697.</p>

                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:103742:130"/>
What more Rational could any Phyſician
have preſcribed, than by Balſmatick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
to heal the Stomach and Lungs, and to
guard them from the ſharpneſs of thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
but Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> was afraid the Oyl
would increaſe the <hi>Nauſea</hi> at the Stomach, but
what a groundleſs Fear was that; for nothing
is more common than for common Drunkards
after a Surfeit to drink great Quantities of
Oyl to heal their Stomachs, and that Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks
are proper when the Lungs are ſo
affected, is found by Experience, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more common than to take Balſams for to
heal the Lungs, and to correct thoſe humours
that inflame them, ſo that ſo far Dr. <hi>Fry</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
according to Reaſon and Experience,
the next Preſcriptions were;</p>

                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:103742:130"/>
But for what end Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> hath ſet
down thoſe Medicines is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> for the
honour and credit of Dr. <hi>Fry,</hi> for conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the cauſe of Mr. <hi>Turner</hi>'s Diſtemper, <hi>viz.</hi>
that it proceeded from hot Liquors inflaming
his Lungs and crude raw Chyle obſtructing
his <hi>Pleura,</hi> what more Rational Method could
be taken than by Coral and Pearl, prepared
to attenuate and diſſolve that crude indigeſted
Matter, which obſtructed the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and at
the ſame time by Diaphoretick Antimony to
carry off thoſe hot Liquors by a moderate
Sweat; for as long as they remained in the
Maſs of Blood, the Inflammation could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be taken off, the Cauſe remaining in it.
But Dr. <hi>Fry</hi> not only prudently gave theſe
Medicines to attenuate the Coagulated Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and to carry thoſe hot Liquors out off
the Maſs of Blood, by a moderate Sweat;
but at the ſame time gave the aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Balſamicks to heal the Lungs in the
mean time, and to abate the Inflammation of
the <hi>Pleura.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that thoſe might be the more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fry,</hi> along with the

                  <p>And now what Fault can be found with this,
ſince there was all the Reaſon that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to make one hope for Succeſs, from
Good Medicines judiciouſly preſcribed? And
what were the Effects? Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> himſelf
truly confeſſes; when he came to him, the
Pain in his ſide was gone, and that he ſweat
prodigiouſly, with a ſhortneſs of Breath; lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reaſon then had they to diſcharge Dr. <hi>Fry,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> deſervedly fell a Victim to
Ignorance and Mr. <hi>Colbatch;</hi> for had he been
continued under the Care of Dr. <hi>Fry</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
he was in a fair way of Recovery;
for the Pain in his ſide being taken away,
was a good ſign that Dr. <hi>Fry's</hi> outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
together with the Medicines he gave
inwardly had all the ſucceſs could be hoped for,
and now all that was to be done was to carry
off thoſe hot Liquors that he had drunk,
which were diſcharged by Sweat, and had
Dr. <hi>Fry</hi> been there who had Judgment and
Skill to manage him, without Queſtion, after
that Sweat, the Matter of his Diſtemper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103742:131"/>
carried off, his <hi>Peripneumony</hi> with his ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Breath would have gone off, and as
for his Pulſe it would have eaſily been raiſed
by a moderate Cordial.</p>
                  <p>But for as much as I can gueſs by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> himſelf gives, all the
Reaſon that Dr. <hi>Fry</hi> was diſcharged was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> was ſo weak with Sweating;
but that was a Reaſon too ſmall to part with
a Phyſician that had his Expectation ſo far in
the removing of his <hi>Pleuriſy.</hi> For what is
more common than for an Healthful Perſon, if
he takes a Sweat to almoſt faint under it, if
it be violent, yet after that Sweat is over they
preſently recover and find themſelves better
in a ſhort time, and weakneſs in Mr. <hi>Turner's</hi>
Caſe was nothing but what might be expected
in two ſuch ſevere Diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>But one that would be cured in two Days,
would not have Patience to ſtay three, and
therefore Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> was in all haſt ſent for
to be his Phyſitian.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> came and finding
Nature throw off the diſtemper'd Humor
by Sweat, he preſently pour'd in Acid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
and was not content with this but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ordered him to be laid in clean Linen,
by which means he endeavoured all he could
to ſtop that Sweating, ſo that the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered.
Humor that ought to be carried off,
was in great meaſure prevented, which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103742:132"/>
Nature with it's Quantity, Mr. <hi>Turner</hi>
from that time by degrees began to yield to
the Diſtemper, and ſubmit himſelf Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>'s
Victim.</p>
                  <p>But that it may more plainly appear, that
Mr. <hi>Turner</hi>'s Death might rationally be laid
to his Charge, let us conſider how Mr.
<hi>Colbatch</hi> his Acid inwardly, and his expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his Body outwardly, would influence him,
and firſt it is plain, that let them be never ſo
cautious, when his Body was in ſuch a Sweat,
and all his Pores open, the <hi>Circumambient</hi> Air
muſt needs affect it, and a great many of
it's <hi>Nitrous Particles,</hi> getting into the Pores
of his Body (for as Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> with his
Spectacles perceived in his Treatiſe of the
Gout, the Skin hath Receptory Pores) muſt
needs thicken and coagulate the <hi>Serum</hi> of
his Blood, which in that Temper was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of receiving the leaſt Impreſſion from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
Now the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood being
thus impregnated with Nitre, and at the ſame
time his Spirits being fixed and depreſſed by
an internal Uſe of Acids, and withal the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered
Humor by that means kept in his
Body: Death was all that could be expected
from ſuch barbarous Uſage; but that Mr.
<hi>Colbatch</hi> may be condemned by his own
Words, I ſhall here to cloſe up this Chapter,
bring his Words to witneſs againſt him,
which prove, that his giving of Acids inwardly,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103742:132"/>
and his expoſing him to the <hi>Ambient</hi> Air in
ſuch a condition was enough to kill, had he
been in a better Condition then he was; for P.
39 of this Treatiſe he ſays, <hi>Sweat is an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalious
Excrement</hi> and Page 37. <hi>All the Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
that there is to be found in the Blood, is
moſt certain an Excrement, and in a way of being
carried off by ſome of the</hi> Emuctories, <hi>and if
any one of the</hi> Emuctories <hi>be ſtop'd, that this
Excrementitious Alkaly hath not room to paſs
out by them, then there is a Distemper of ſome
kind or other cauſed, the Blood being over
Charged with this Excrementitious Matter.
How many Diſtempers are occaſioned by what we
call taking cold, which is nothing elſe but a
Conſtipation of the Pores.</hi> And now from
theſe Words it appears that whatever keeps
this Excrement from going off cauſes a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
I having therefore from thoſe Words
in the beginning of his Book ſhewed, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids
by Coagulating keeps it from going
off, it muſt needs follow Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> by
this Uſage ſtoping that Sweat, hindred this
Excrement from going off, and cauſed ſome
Diſtemper, which joyning with his other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
which he was ſcarce able to bear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſo overcharged and oppreſſed Nature
that the Poor Gentleman was forced to dye
for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:103742:133"/>
Thus I have briefly taken a View of Mr.
<hi>Turner's</hi> Caſe, wherein I have ſhewed the
reaſonable Proceedings of Dr. <hi>Fry,</hi> and the
moſt abſurd and fatal Conſequences of Mr.
<hi>Colbatch</hi> his Acids, I ſhall now leave Mr.
<hi>Colbatch</hi> to value himſelf over his Nonſence,
and like a Dung-hill Cock to ſtrut over his
Rubbiſh, he hath Reaſon to be proud with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Queſtion, when he can perform ſuch
Exploits as theſe in the midſt of his Knight-Errantry
without Controul.</p>

HIS

OF THE

                  <p>WHilſt the former Sheets were in
the Preſs, Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
publiſhed another Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen
of his Ignorance, I
ſhall in the next place proceed to an Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of it; and tho' one would think, what
he has ſaid was ſufficient to make the World
cautious, yet I ſhall not think it too much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to undeceive it a little further; and to
ſhew, that the Perſon whom he pretends to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103742:135"/>
have cured by Acids, was by no means cured
by Acids, but ſuch Medicines as are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
uſed to correct Acids, and ſharp corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Salts.</p>
                  <p>Which that I may do with all poſſible Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
I ſhall take the ſubſtance of what he ſays;
paſſing by all thoſe unneceſſary Tales which
have no Relation to the Cure: For his Book
from the beginning to Page the <hi>6th</hi> is filled
up with an Account, how fooliſhly the Man
came to be bit with the Viper, and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately
he was hurried about the Town
afterwards, which being nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
I ſhall paſs to his Method of Cure.</p>
                  <p>And here, <hi>Firſt,</hi> it will be neceſſary to
conſider, wherein conſiſts the Poyſon of
that Creature, and then we ſhall be better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to determine what were his Proceedings
in the Cure of it.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe I don't only write to ſatisfie
the Publick, who are not competent Judges;
but alſo to undeceive Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> himſelf, I
ſhall here confute what he hath ſaid, by his
own Words, we are therefore to believe, that
all Bodies, from which can be drawn by
Chymical Analization, a Volatile Oyl, are
Acids, it appearing from his Appendix of
Acids and Alkalies, that all Oleaginous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are Acids; now if Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
himſelf, he muſt disbelieve himſelf alſo;
for from what he ſays Page 12, <hi>viz.</hi> he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:103742:135"/>
that the Poyſon of Vipers is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,
he denys what he ſaid in his Appendix,
where it is by his own Words pronounced an
Acid, becauſe it contains an Oleaginous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
but well may Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> go on to
contradict himſelf, who hath ſo often done it
before; for from his Writings it is plain, that
the longer he writes, the worſe he manages
what he pretends to.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall not here urge, that the Poyſon
of Vipers is an Acid, from what he ſays in
his Appendix; having in anſwer to that,
made it appear, that what he there ſays is
falſe.</p>
                  <p>But we have great Reaſon to believe that the
Poyſon of Vipers, is an Acid corroding ſaline
Humor, ſince in reſpect of the Blood, it
cauſes for the moſt Part, the ſame Symptoms
with <hi>Mercurius Sublimat.</hi> which I have there
proved to be an Acid; for by that ſubtile
corroſive Salt, with which it abounds; it
corrodes and corrupts the Maſs of Blood,
and by that Sulphureous Oyl, which is
mixed with it at the ſame time, raiſes a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
Ferment; thoſe Parts fermenting
preternaturally with each other; and that it is
an Acid, is further evident: Becauſe it hath
the ſame Effects which Acids generally have;
for as it is commonly known, that all Acids as
Spirit of Vitriol, Alum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> diſpoſe the
Maſs of Blood to Coagulation, and that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103742:136"/>
when the Stomach abounds with Acids, as
in Childrens Stomachs it curdles, ſo does this
Poyſon curdle the Blood.</p>
                  <p>Page 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He Inſtances <hi>Lemery</hi>'s Conceſſions
to prove it an Alkaly; but we have ſo much
Reaſon to believe, that it is an Acid, that
except <hi>Lemery,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> prove it, and
diſprove what I have ſaid, we deny what he
ſo willingly grants. But,</p>
                  <p>Page 16, Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> ſays, <hi>Hoffman ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicules
Charras</hi> for afferting, that it is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid;
for ſays he, <hi>if it were ſo, how could the
Juice of Citrons (which is an Acid) afford the
Patient any Relief.</hi> But if this be all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that <hi>Hoffman,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> have to
<hi>ridicule Charras;</hi> I am afraid they have very
ſorry grounds for it; for it may very eaſily be
underſtood, how a Volatile Salt, tho' Acid,
may be corrected by a crude Acid, for Volatile
Salts conſiſt of Parts ſo minutely rarified, that
they are eaſily diſſolved, and put into ſo brisk a
Ferment, as to penetrate and corrupt the whole
Maſs in a ſmall time; whereas fixed crude Acids,
whoſe Parts are unapt for Motion, are not ſo
eaſily diſſolved, but mixed with thoſe more
fierce volatile Salts, take off their force, and
dull the Edges of them, and ſtop their Motion
by lying in their way, and from hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
the Reaſon why <hi>Elixir Vitrioli,</hi> abated
the Symptoms, for the preſent, which he
mentions Page 6, not becauſe that <hi>Elixir</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:103742:136"/>
the Morbifick Matter, but yoked up
the more Volatile Parts of the Poyſon, for a
while.</p>
                  <p>But to prove more fully, that the force of
this Poyſon depends on a corroding Acid Salt,
let us conſider the Method of Cure, where
he gives. <hi>Fol. Rutae. Rad. Angelic. Hyſpan.
&amp; Rad. Serpenter. Virginenſ.</hi> in great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Now if we look into <hi>Sennertus,</hi> the
Medicines which are there are of the ſame
Nature with theſe, which are all uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Poyſon, and to correct Acidities, which
coagulate and thicken the Maſs of Blood;
yet theſe Medicines Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> muſt needs
call Acids; but from hence it appears, that
they are ſo far from being Acids, that they
are indeed quite oppoſite, and although, as
I have often taken notice, Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> takes
the Liberty to change the Names of Things,
and calls them what he pleaſes, yet he might
with equal Reaſon call Sower, Bitter, as Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Acid; but ſince it is evident from the
Taſte of theſe Medicines that they are by no
means Acids, and from the Books of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men, that they are uſed amongſt thoſe
Antidotes, which expel Poyſon and correct
Acids, it conſequently follows, that they
cannot be Acids themſelves, but we have
Reaſon to believe the Poyſon is Acid, becauſe
theſe which are of a contrary Nature to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids
expel it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:103742:137"/>
But Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> will ſay, that tho' theſe
be not Acids, yet ſince he gave Acids along
with them, it could not have been cured
without thoſe, but we are rather thence to
underſtand, how ſorrily Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
the Practical Part of Phyſick; who
gives one Medicine to expel, and another to
to hinder it's Expluſion, and that Acid would
hinder, and not promote the Expulſion of the
Poyſon is plain, from Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
which he took with Eſquire <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi>
for there to the Gentlemans great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
he acknowledges, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of his giving Acids was to ſtop Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to keep the Diſtempered Matter
from going off by Tranſpiration, and if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids
there would ſtop Tranſpiration, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Diſtemper'd Matter from going off; by
the ſame Rule alſo, it would hinder the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
from being expelled; and it muſt needs
contribute much to the Honour of the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> that he gives one thing
to expel Poyſon, and at the ſame time ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to prevent the good Effects of
that; Contradiction is one of his greateſt
Qualifications, and therefore he ought to be
looked upon for it, withal the Reſpect due to
ſuch Merits.</p>
                  <p>And Mr. <hi>Stringer</hi> may thank God, that
he had ſuch a Prudent Man as Dr. <hi>Slone</hi> along
with him, who knew how to manage ſo
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:103742:137"/>
Dogmatical an Impoſtor, as Mr. <hi>Colbatch;</hi>
for had there not been enough of Virginian
Snake Weed, to overpower the Acids, and
to expel the Poyſon, it would have ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
with it's full Force, the Acid only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to check it, and keep it under for a
while, and by no means to prevent it's ill
Effects, for the future; for as it is an old
Maxim ſo it is as true.</p>
                  <q>Sincerum niſi Vas quicquid infundis aceſcit.</q>
                  <p>And thus much may ſerve in Anſwer to
what Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> ſays concerning a Viper;
for tho' he hath troubled himſelf to tell a
Parcel of idle Tales, which are ſo much unfit
to appear in Print, that they ought not to be
mentioned even in Converſation, yet I ſhall
not think it neceſſary to take notice of them,
all that he ſays in relation to the Cure of the
Viper being contained in three Leaves.</p>

                     <head>An EXAMINATION of what
Mr. Colbatch ſays further in
Vindication of his Hypotheſis.</head>
                     <p>HAving already proved, that what he
ſays concerning the Cure of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
bit by a Viper, ſo far from being any
thing to his Credit, that it only ſhews his
Ignorance, I ſhall now proceed to examin
what he ſays further, in favour, of his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</p>
                     <p>And having before in my Examination of
his laſt Book, given my real Sentiments of
this Controverſy betwixt Mr. <hi>Tuthil</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Colbatch, viz.</hi> That they are both out of the
way, and are ſo far miſtaken, that neither of
them ſays any thing to the purpoſe, I ſhall
not enlarge here, but ſhall only take Notice
of what Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> hath ſaid further in
favour of his Abſurdities; and ſhall paſs by
all thoſe impertinent and frivolous Stories,
which are rather a Scandal to Phyſick, than
themſelves, becauſe any Body that hath Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and reads their Nonſence, are certified
nothing better can be expected from them.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding their Ignorance, they
compliment one another very prittily, and
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> declares his deſign in ſo doing,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103742:138"/>
is, only to ſhew his reſpect to one, that he hopes can
do him no ſervice in convincing him.</p>
                     <p>But to examin what relates to his Abſurdities concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Acids and Alkalies Page 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſays; <hi>In very many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive
Caſes, it is uſual for the Patient to ſpit up perfect
Chalk, and that in great quantities: Now if the Blood were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharged
with Acids in Conſumptions, the whole maſs paſſing
ſo frequently through the Lungs, could not fail of being ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Chalky Alkaly.</hi> How abſurd it is to call tough
Phlegm, Chalk, will be ſo evident to any one that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
their time in reading his Book, that it would be
unneceſſary to ſay any more concerning it: and that,
tho' it were an Alkaly, it would not at all contribute
to ſweeten the Blood, will appear from what I have
already ſaid, when he aſſerted the ſame Abſurdity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that Coagulated Matter which makes up the
Nodes in the Gout, <hi>viz.</hi> that it lies out of the way of
Circulation, or if it did not, it could abſorb Acids no
longer, when once it's Pores were filled, which would
be in a Moment; but it is evident, that it is ſo far
from being an Alkaly, that it is only crude <hi>Serum</hi>
too much thickned by Acids, and hardned into
Phlegm, the Watery Parts being evaporated by Heat.
And that it is the Nature of Acids to thicken ſuch
Humors hath ſufficiently appeared from what I have
ſaid, and from himſelf in Mr. <hi>Turner's</hi> Caſe, where
he gives Acids, which thickning the <hi>Serum</hi> of the
Blood made it incapable of going off by Tranſpiration.</p>
                     <p>Page 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſays; <hi>The Phoſporus is a true Animal fire,
and is to be extracted from all Animal ſubſtances; and if
it did not exiſt in them, how is it poſſible, for it to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from them.</hi> To this one that does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
Phyſick may anſwer, as poſſible as for a Cart
Wheel to be made of a Tree, which People don't
therefore conclude exiſtent in the Tree in the Form of
a Wheell; but this is an Inſtance which a Coach-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker

                     <p>Page 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſays, <hi>I do ſtill affirm that Fevers in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

ſince he elſewhere ſays, that all the Excrements of our

but only Acids, which by contracting the
Pores of thoſe Emunctories, and withal thickning
the <hi>Serum,</hi> make it unfit to be carried off.</p>

Spr. CC. <hi>for the</hi> Rad. Serpentariae <hi>belongs to me.</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> does well to claim his Priviledges,
but there is no other Reaſon why it ſhould not be claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with <hi>Pulv. è chelis,</hi> but this, that it corrects Acids
abundantly more powerfully, and if that which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
taſtes Bitter and deſtroys Acids can be an
Acid, then Acid is Bitter, and Black is White, but
till Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> can prove that, <hi>Rad. Serpentariae</hi> will
be no Acid.</p>
                     <p>Page 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſays, <hi>I do boldly aſſert, that in no Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that ever I have yet met with, let them be either
Benign or Malign, have I ever yet obſerved, that the
Patient hath been in the leaſt Senſible of any Acidity in
the Stomach or Mouth.</hi> But notwithſtanding Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is not perceivable in the Mouth, yet it is probable
and true, that Acidity is the occaſion of the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
perceived there, by making it too thick and
clammy to go off, by other proper Paſſages, and Mr.
<hi>Colbatch</hi> ſo far is Block-head-like in the Right of
it; for ſometimes they have a clammy bitter Taſte
in their Mouths, but yet according to his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
Acids are the Cauſe of that Bitter Taſte;
for he ſays Acids are Bitter, Namely, <hi>Rad. Serpentariae.</hi>
Again if Acids are Bitter, perhaps he will ſay <hi>Choler</hi>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:103742:139"/>
is an Acid, and no doubt, but if it were for his pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe,
he would ſay ſo, had he not elſewhere called
it an Alkaly. But that it may be more evident, that
Acidity is the Cauſe of all thoſe ill Taſtes, which
Feveriſh People have, we are to remember, that he
often aſſerts, that all the Excrements of our Body
are Alkalies, and if ſo, Acidity is the Cauſe of thoſe
ill Taſtes in the Mouth, becauſe they alone, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Doctrin of Acids and Alkalies, can
hinder theſe Alkalies from going off by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Emunctories, which I have ſufficiently proved
before, and therefore need not ſay any more here.</p>
                     <p>Page 41. Firſt He ſays; <hi>The Life of Man is Flame,</hi>
&amp;c. And Page 42 he asks, <hi>If Fire is not actually exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
in Animal Bodies, how is it poſſible it ſhould be extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from them?</hi> As for the firſt of theſe I have Anſwered
it ſufficiently in my Treatiſe of the <hi>Heat of the Blood,</hi>
and therefore I ſhall refer the Reader to that for an
Anſwer, it being not neceſſary to tranſcribe all that
I have there ſaid in Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>All that he further ſays from Page 42 to 54, is
to aſſert, that there is Flame in the Blood, and that
there is no Fermentation. But it being only Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>
his Opinion, I ſhall alſo refer the Reader for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
there, and I wonder Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> did not
think fit to Vindicate Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> from thoſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but the Reaſon I believe is, becauſe he could
not; for when I was lately in <hi>London,</hi> he told me
he had writ ſomething to this purpoſe, and when
I asked whether he had anſwered my Book, he told
me he did not love to mix his Notions with other
Men's, and that he would not read my Book till his
was printed, which I conceive was only an Excuſe,
becauſe at that time he had writ moſt of this Book,
againſt <hi>Tuthill,</hi> and was willing to print it, againſt him,
tho' at the ſame time he knew my Book contained
a Confutation of it, all that he ſays coming to no
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:103742:140"/>
more, than that the Blood grows hot by Accenſion and
not by Fermentation; the former of which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
confuted in my Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> and tho'
I have aſſerted, that the Blood grows hot by Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
yet any one that reads my Book, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
it with what he ſays, will ſee, that I don't
mean by Fermentation, ſuch a Fermentation as he
here denies, but only ſuch a Degree of Motion, of the
Minute Particles of Matter, as are able to cauſe a
Senſation of Heat upon our Senſory.</p>
                     <p>Page 44. To prove that Heat is not produced af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Hypotheſis, He ſays; <hi>I can aſſure you
I know ſeveral Fluids the more brisk they are moved, the
colder they are; as for Inſtance, a River is always colder in
that Place where there is a quick Current, than where the
Water ſtands ſtill: The Air is always more or leſs cold,
according as the Motion of it is greater or leſſer, and I
can aſſure you, I have been almoſt ſtarved when forced
to Travel in the high Winds in the Winter time, at which
Seaſon the Air is moſt full of Nitrous Particles.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
Page 50, He ſays; <hi>If the progreſſive Motion from
the Heart to the Extremities gives it it's Heat, by the
ſame Reaſon, I think the Water which runs from our Cocks
ſhould be warm alſo.</hi> Now from hence we way eaſily
gather, what an extraordinary Philoſopher Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
is, who attributes the Heat or Cold of Fluids, to
a collective Motion of a whole Maſs, inſtead of the
Particles which conſtitute that Maſs; for he ſays a
River is Coldeſt where the Current is greateſt, and
to this I Anſwer, that I, having given the Reaſon of
Heat, in my Treatiſe <hi>of the Reaſon of the Heat of the
Blood,</hi> I need not repeat it again; but leaſt Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch,</hi>
when he finds it there, cannot apply it, I ſhall
tell him, that the Reaſon why Wind and Water, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuouſly
moved, cauſe Cold, is, becauſe thoſe Parts
are more forcibly driven upon the Senſory; and how
they cauſe a Cold Senſation there, is plain from what
I have ſaid concerning the <hi>Vſe of the Lungs,</hi> in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:103742:140"/>
Nitre into the Blood, where I have aſſerted,
that, tho' Nitre be in a gentle Motion it ſelf, when Fluid
in the Air, yet it is Naturally inclinable to reſt, and
diſpoſes thoſe Humors to a reſt with which it is mixed;
for which reaſon Water freezes in the Winter;
and tho' the Water and Air in which this Nitre ſwims
be in Motion, yet that is not ſuch a Motion as cauſes
Heat; for a Senſation of Heat depends on Matter in
ſuch a degree of Motion as is a little above Nature,
which preternaturally affecting us, cauſes Heat, and
that Motion, is not a Motion of a whole Maſs col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively,
but a ſwift inteſtin Motion of the Parts of
that Matter ſubtilized and rarified to a certain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
from whence it appears, that tho Water and Air
be in Motion, yet the Nitre which ſwims in them,
being laid down upon the Senſory, diſpoſes thoſe
Fluids about it to reſt, by which means there being a
lower degree of Motion, than is requiſite to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a Natural Temper, we feell a contrary Senſation
to Heat, and if ſo, the more theſe Nitrous Parts are
forced upon our Body, the greater muſt be the Cold.</p>
                     <p>And as for what he ſays of the Progreſſive Motion
of the Blood in the Veſſels, I never heard that any
ever affirmed it to be the Cauſe of Heat; ſo that there
he might have ſpared what he hath ſaid againſt no
Body; but tho' Water in a River moved by ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
Cauſe in a whole Stream, does not grow hot,
yet if it be ſet over a Fire where it hath an Agent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
enough to work upon it's Minute Parts, and to put
them in Motion, it ſoon changes it's Temper.</p>
                     <p>Page 61<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſays, <hi>I am very glad you own Alkalies to
abound in Pleuriſies and Rheumatiſms and other Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory
Diſtempers.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> muſt not think,
that all the World grants it, becauſe Mr. <hi>Tuthill</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
defend Truth, and therefore I having proved,
that all thoſe Diſtempers proceed from Acids, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
he ſhould confute what I have ſaid, or he gives
up his Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="250" facs="tcp:103742:141"/>
                        <hi>Page 64, He ſays;</hi> Now for want of a due Secretion by
the Excretory Veſſels, the Blood is clogged with too great
a Quantity of <hi>Serum,</hi> which <hi>Serum</hi> being admitted into
the Lymphatick Veſſels, and being impregnated with Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Particles, cannot freely paſs along theſe Veſſels by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it's gelatinous Quality, <hi>&amp;c. And again Page 65
and 66 He ſays;</hi> Such are the Excretory Glands of the
Skin, the <hi>Glandulae Renales,</hi> the Glands of the Liver,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which ſeperate an Alkaly from the Blood to be
thrown off by Excrement, and if by any Accident theſe
Glands are made uncapable of performing their Office; ſo
that the Blood cannot be rid of it's Excrements then a
Diſtemper of ſome kind or other muſt neceſſarily follow,
<hi>and Page 69,</hi> This damnable Diſtemper <hi>(really a very
pretty Epithite)</hi> which although it be rately cured in a
confirmed State, yet in the beginning, nay after it hath
made ſome progreſs, is frequently to be done, and that as
effectually by Chalybeats and Bitters, as by any ſort of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.
But here for want of making Experiments, you
ſay that Steel, and the Bitter Herbs are Alkalies. <hi>And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
Page 72. He ſays,</hi> As for Bitters I will be bound
to lay a good Wager with you, that if you put a Pound of
Centuary, or Wormwood into a Retort, and diſtill it with
an eaſie Fire till all be come off that will, and afterwards
calcine the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> and extract the fixed Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Aſhes, if you don't find a much greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Acid than Alkaly, <hi>&amp;c. And from hence he
would infer, that Bitters are Acids.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But he hath rather taken an effectual way to prove
the Inſufficiency of Chymiſtry, in diſcovering the
Principles of Bodies; for if it will alter Bitter, and
turn moſt of it Acid, who can be ſo ſtupified as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that this diſcovers the Nature of Bitter? Can
Aloes be turned into Juice of Oranges, and Aloes not
be deſtroyed? It's in vain to reaſon with ſuch Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots;
yet this is not all, we may throughout theſe Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
ſee, how miſerably the dull Soul forgets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
having repeated the ſame things often in other
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:103742:141"/>
Books; and alſo how blindly he contradicts himſelf
here, according to his Cuſtom; and how fully he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
himſelf. For firſt, Page 64. He ſays, <hi>The Serum
being too much impregnated with Alkaline Particles, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
paſs free through the Veſſels, by reaſon of its Gelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Quality;</hi> as if the Gelatinous Quality depended
on a Mixture of Alkalies, whereas it appears from the
Experiment he mentions in his Treatiſe of the Gout,
that the whole Serum of Healthful People is Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
and abounds with Alkalies, where there is no
ſuch Gelatinous Quality; and therefore as I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
taken notice, we are to conclude, that the Gelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Quality depends on a mixture of too much Acid;
becauſe, as I before ſaid, that is ſaid to be the Cauſe of
an Effect, in whoſe Abſence there is no ſuch Diſtemper,
but on the contrary when mixed with it.</p>
                     <p>From whence it appears, that the Reaſon why the
Excretory Glands cannot perform their Office in eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating
Excrementitious Alkaly, as he ſays, Page 65,
66, is, becauſe Acid is mixed with it; and this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
from his own Words; for if the Excrements be
Alkalies naturally, they would not obſtruct, were there
no Acids to coagulate them.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſee how coherent Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> is in his
Thoughts. Page 69. He aſſerts, That the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which in a Paſſion he calls <hi>Damnable,</hi> if curable is
to be cured by Chalybeats and Bitters, the former of
which I have before proved an Alkaly, and that Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is not Acid, any Body knows, that can diſtinguiſh
betwixt Taſtes; but if Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> can perſwade Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that Wormwood is Acid, he may make any
thing go down with them, but ſince Children have
too nice Palates to be ſo deceived, I hope thoſe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Years have not loſt their Taſte.</p>
                     <p>All that I need further to take notice of Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi>
his Productions in theſe Quotations, is another Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Confutation of himſelf: For Page 66, He ſays,
<hi>The bitter Excrement of the Liver, to wit, Choler, is an
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:103742:142"/>
Alkaly:</hi> Yet Page 72. Bitters are Acids, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Choler, as may be ſeen in the Words I have quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
I might take notice of other Abſurdities and Falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
contained in the foregoing Quotations, but what
I have ſaid being ſufficient, I ſhall not extend a Book
of this kind to too large a Compaſs.</p>
                     <p>Page 91. He ſays, <hi>The Blood cannot ſuper abound with
Acids—Becauſe the Stomach will not receive or retain
more than it hath occaſion for.</hi> The Reaſon he gives a
little before, is, <hi>If at any time People are not ſufficiently
cautious of that Matter, but load the Stomach with more
manifeſt Acids than the Body hath occaſion for, ſhe won't
fail of rejecting them by Vomit.</hi> That this is falſe, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body knows that have but lived in the World long
enough to take notice of what occurs daily; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more common than for Children to bring Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
upon themſelves, by eating of unripe Fruit,
and not only Children, but grown People; and theſe
Mr. <hi>Calbatch</hi> cannot deny to be Acids ſurely, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
what he aſcribed long Life in <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> to,
<hi>viz.</hi> eating Fruit; beſides, it is too commonly known,
that many People almoſt ruin their Conſtitutions by
drinking Vinegar, the very ſame Acid he mentions.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have gone through all that he further
ſays, concerning the Uſe of Acids, and proved it to
be as abſurd and ridiculous as the reſt of his Incoheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and now ſhall leave him to conſider when he
writes again, whether it will not be prudent to read
his former Books over again, leſt he, ſince he is ſo
forgetful, ſhould be guilty of too much Repetition;
for in what he hath already writ, he hath repeated the
ſame thing ſo many times over, that were the Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
taken out, his Books might all be writ in half the
Compaſs: And now, ſince I have anſwered them all,
I ſhall give him this Caution, That if he repeats any
thing again, which he hath already writ, without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
I ſhall only need in anſwer, to ſhew where I
have already confuted it.</p>

TO
Dr. Leigh's Remarks, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>SOON after I returned from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi>
I received a Sheet of Paper entituled, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi>
on my Book, <hi>concerning the Heat of the
Blood;</hi> to which there being no Name pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed,
I could not imagin who it ſhould come from;
but preſently after being inform'd by a Friend at <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
(who was concerned to ſee that you had loſt the
Uſe of your Reaſon) that it was the elaborate Work
of ſuch an unfortunate Author, and alſo having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Letter from one in <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> to whom I
am obliged for acquainting me, that you are ſo fond
of it, as to own your ſelf the Author of ſo polite a
Piece; I had Reaſon to aſcribe the Praiſe and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due to a Work of ſo extraordinary Merit to the
inconſiderable Author; A Title, which I profeſs, I,
by no means envy you for, and therefore with all the
Submiſſion due to a Man ſo mighty in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
and ſo contemptuous in the Opinion of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I beg your Pardon, if I am too forwards in
contributing to your Character, by letting the World
know, to whom I am obliged for ſuch a ſignal Token of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:103742:144"/>
Favour, and they for ſharp Wit and ſuch a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Strain of Phancy; Phancy! Below the common
Strain of rational Creatures, yet the ſtrongeſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s Underſtanding; and what I
hear is according to your laudable Cuſtom, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you meet with any thing that is contrary to
your own wild Notions or a Subject of your Envy.</p>
                  <p>I was indeed told by ſome Friends, that nothing
which Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> could write, would be worth my taking
Notice of; therefore this, by no means was: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
taking a Survey of your <hi>Remarks,</hi> and finding
throughout the whole, terrible ſtrong Symptoms of
a ſick Brain, and not in the leaſt Motives to any thing
but Pity, I thought it a piece of Charity to let you
ſee your own Infirmities; for your Underſtanding
is not only very much diſtemper'd, but withal your
Reaſon ſo deprav'd, if not altogether loſt, that I
fear your Diſtemper is ſcarce curable; your <hi>Remarks</hi>
being nothing but a heap of Incoherences, which
are ſtrong Arguments that you are very foul within,
and very far gone; for would any Man in his Senſes
ever yoke a <hi>Pig</hi> and an <hi>Elephant</hi> together in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a <hi>Treatiſe of the Heat of the Blood?</hi> Or could
a Man who had not quite loſt his Reaſon, compare
a <hi>Mouſe</hi> and a <hi>Cheeſmonger</hi> together? I warrant, you
thought my Book was two hard a Task for an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
of your Size, except it had ſharper Teeth than
your ſelf, or of a greater Bulk, otherwiſe your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
<hi>Cockloft</hi> which you call a Head, would ſcarce
have thought of an <hi>Elephant</hi> or a <hi>Mouſe</hi> to devour it.</p>
                  <p>But to what Purpoſe it is to talk to a Man ſo ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deprav'd? Since it is an impoſſible to perſwade
you that you are not in your Senſes, as to cure you?
Nevertheleſs give me leave to tell you, you'll ſcarce
be cured till made ſenſible of your Malady; and tho'
Crazy Men are uſually angry at thoſe that tell
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:103742:144"/>
them ſo, and not apt to believe it, I deſire you to be
convinced for your own ſake.</p>
                  <p>Yet it would be more advantage to me, could I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the World that you are in your Senſes, becauſe
it might be preſumed that you, who in your Paſſion,
have expreſſed ſo much Zeal againſt me, would alſo
here have produced Reaſon againſt my Book had it
lain in your Power; and therefore your <hi>Remarks</hi> would
be a Recommendation to my Book, they ſhewing
that Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> can give no Reaſon againſt it.</p>
                  <p>For which Reaſon I would perſwade the World,
that you are neither crazed nor mad, becauſe you
never arrived at ſuch a Degree of Wit to go mad,
which tho' a ſtrong Argument, will not prevail;
they think it is impoſſible any Man in his Senſes
ſhould rave out ſuch ſtuff; and truly, a Man in his
Senſes, would ſcarce think ill Words without Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
ſufficient to confute a Rational Hypotheſis.</p>
                  <p>But I confeſs, I can have little ſatisfaction in talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Madman, and therefore, for my own ſake,
I ſhall only conceive all this proceeds from Paſſion
and Ignorance, and tho' it be not much better to talk
to an Ignorant Man than to a Madman, yet it is a
little more excuſable, and I may make a better
Apology to the World for it, becauſe one that is
ignorant may be inſtructed.</p>
                  <p>But the Town of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> perhaps may ask, Can
Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> be ignorant, who tells News ſo prettily?
Should ſuch a Queſtion be asked, I ſhould deſire them

they will find Phyſick requires more ſound Judgment
and Reaſon than News, or than Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> hath there
laid down. But they ſay he does ſome Cures in the
Neighbourhood? To which I anſwer, that a ſerious
old Woman with two Receipts would exceed him
to admiration; and that he is very ignorant in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
will appear by and by; for firſt his <hi>Remarks</hi> are
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103742:145"/>
only made up of <hi>Remarks</hi> on <hi>Pigs, Mice, Elephants,
Cocklofts,</hi> &amp;c. and Queſtions concerning my Book,
which are rather an Effect of his own Ignorance than
any Fault in my Book; for ſome things he ſays he
does not underſtand, others he asks how can they be
ſo, and that other things cannot be ſo: But I am to
be blamed for taking no more notice of the Doctor
than to neglect to direct my Diſcourſe to him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
when I talk of Ignorance, with which he is
ſo well acquainted; and therefore Doctor when you
ſay that ſuch things as I have proved cannot be, I
conceive it proceeds from raſhneſs of Judgment ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Reaſon; becauſe you have given none, and
therefore I would adviſe you to look into the firſt
Chapter of the general Epiſtle of St. <hi>James v. 5. If
any Man ask Wiſdom, let him ask it of God:</hi> And
when your Prayers have proved effectual, you will be
more capable of underſtanding thoſe Queſtions
which you ask, by which means your Judgment will
be better Qualified in reſpect of the latter.</p>
                  <p>And that your Neighbours may judge what a Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Phyſician you are, I ſhall take a View of your
<hi>Remarks,</hi> and ſee in what ſort of ſubjects your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
lies in. And truly Sir, were it not the Wiſe
Man's Advice to anſwer a Fool according to his Folly,
leſt he ſhould be wiſe in his own Conceit, I ſhould
abhor the Thoughts of ſpending a Minute upon what
you think witty: But to make you ſenſible what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
you have to be humble, I ſhall run over briefly
the Subjects of your Thoughts; And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> We may take notice that Pag. the 4th you
have been a mighty Man at making Obſervations
among the <hi>Pigs,</hi> where by the ſtrength of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the ſight of a <hi>Pig</hi> hath put you in mind of an
<hi>Elephant;</hi> and according to your profound Judgment
you have diſtinguiſhed betwixt theſe Animals; and
in imitation of the <hi>Pigs,</hi> Page the 11th, you have
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103742:145"/>
condeſcended to take a C—T—d in your Mouth, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
your ſelf there was <hi>a Roſe in the Surface,</hi> your
diſappointment wherein, I ſuppoſe, made you ſpit
it out at me: But this is beaſtly Manners, truly Doctor,
and had you not been a ſubtle Pig indeed, you might
have diſgorged the Materials of your Underſtanding
another way, without fouling Paper with ſuch Stuff;
but perhaps your brutal Obſervations have not quite
degenerated you into that Species of Animals, and
that glimmering of Reaſon you had left, directed
you to put <hi>C—T—d</hi> in your <hi>Remarks,</hi> to put People in
mind what uſe to make of them, and if ſo, you have
your Deſire; for moſt People that read them, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lay them up for a <hi>Bog-houſe</hi> Uſe, only ſay it's a pity,
but Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſhould have the Office of a <hi>Bog-houſe</hi>-Door-keeper
at <hi>Brazen-Noſe</hi> to make public Uſe of
what he hath provided; for moſt People are afraid of
fouling their Fingers with a Piece of Paper the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
hath dirty'd already.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is not all, you have not only
been a great Critick amongſt the <hi>Pigs,</hi> but have pry'd
cloſely amongſt the Dairy-maids, where you have
metaphorically called the <hi>Mouſe</hi> a <hi>Cheeſmonger.</hi> Poor
Animal! Alas! that the <hi>Mouſe</hi> who hath long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
a Freedom from the Preſs, ſhould be trapp'd,
remarked upon, and miſcalled by Dr. <hi>Leigh.</hi> A very
fine Subject for ſo ſubtile, ſo cunning an Author!</p>
                  <p>Page the 8th you have put us in Mind, that you are
a Learned Man amongſt the School Boys, who have
not yet forgot to play at Ball; but Doctor, for my
part, ſince I have left off ſuch things, I ſhall leave
Fools and Children to play together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Amongſt theſe Niceties you have acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the World, that the <hi>Pudenda of a Salt Bitch</hi> hath
been a mighty Subject of your Admiration, and perhaps
you have ſometimes envyed the Dogs Felicity in the
Enjoyment, and it's a wonder you never proved
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103742:146"/>
Rival. Poor Man! Man did I ſay? Poor Childiſh,
Peeviſh Creature! Who is it but pities you, that you
ſhould employ your Thoughts on no better Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeems theſe poor Animals are not only the
Subjects of your Revenge, but <hi>Iriſh-Men</hi> and a whole
Nation muſt have a Jeſt upon them, for Laughter's
ſake, and be call'd <hi>Fools.</hi> Pray Doctor, what wrong have
<hi>Iriſh-Men</hi> done you? ſurely you don't think me one;
No, you are ſenſible I am your Country Man; but
ſince no Body can ſtand out of the reach of ſuch
Poyſonous Air as your <hi>Remarks</hi> were made in, give
me leave to tell you in your own Words, that ſome
ſuch <hi>Air hath influenced you,</hi> or your Wit might have
been a little more cleanly.</p>
                  <p>Thus far Doctor, I have Anſwered you <hi>according
to your Folly, leſt you ſhould be Wiſe in your own Conceit;</hi>
but none but Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> can be fond of ſuch <hi>Remarks,</hi>
and you have ſo little Reaſon that I ſhall alſo take the
<hi>Wiſeman's</hi> Advice, who ſays, <hi>Anſwer not a Fool according
to his Folly, leſt thou ſhould be like unto him;</hi> for indeed
the Learned World hath got ſuch an Opinion of you,
that of all the crazed Men, or Men in their Senſes
I know, I would not chuſe to be like you. I ſhall
only therefore let you know, that the Cook and
Skulleon of <hi>Brazen-Noſe,</hi> having held a Debate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the 5th Page of your <hi>Remarks;</hi> they fell into a
Paſſion, becauſe you have laid their <hi>Scotch Scollops</hi> in
ſuch Dirty Language; ill Words being no good
Sauce.</p>
                  <p>Thus far Doctor, I have traced the Symptoms of
your Diſtemper, and taken a View of ſome of the
profound Obſervations you are excellent in; I might
indeed go on and take notice of your <hi>Remarks</hi> on
<hi>Bog-houſes, Duck-ſhot,</hi> Roger <hi>of</hi> Caverly, <hi>the Wiſe
Men of</hi> Gothan, and Diego <hi>with his</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Geeſe;</hi>
but leaving theſe I ſhall make my <hi>Remarks</hi> on a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:103742:146"/>
Gooſe, and ſhall proceed to give you a little
Information of thoſe things which you are Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of; and ſince your Underſtanding is ſo far viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
may I endeavour to make you a Man of a little
more Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Page the 3d you ſay, <hi>You find I think, Fire is not actually
Hot in it ſelf, but as it affects the Senſory:</hi> What a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted
Man that can find a thing at the firſt ſight,
when it is before his Eyes! It is a Wonder, that
one that raves of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Geeſe and ſuch Creatures,
ſhould have a Tallent at diſcerning, for Doctor you
have found it right, for really I think Fire is not
actually Hot in it ſelf, but as it affects the Senſory;
and I, having given my Reaſons for it in my Book,
ſhall think ſo ſtill till you have anſwered thoſe, and
given me Reaſons to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Page the 6th you ask, <hi>How comes it to paſs that a
Nerve will not ſwell above the ſtraiteſt Ligature, or any
of this Mucilage diſtil upon Section, or cannot by Preſſure
be ſqueezed from it?</hi> I am glad a Man in your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
deſires to be ſo informed; and therefore I ſhall
tell you that why it will not diſtil upon Section
nor be ſqueezed out by Preſſure, you might have learnt
in my Book from Page the 86th to the 91ſt, which I
need not repeat here; and as for the Reaſon why a
Nerve will not ſwell above the ſtraiteſt Ligature, it is
very plain; for any one that does but underſtand,
how the Nerves are branched up and down the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and how they communicate with each other,
and withal how gentle the Motion of the Spirits is
through the Nerves, in compariſon of the rapid
Motion of the Blood through the Sanguiferous
Veſſels, will eaſily underſtand what a little thing ſtops
the force of them, if a Paſſage be denied, and how
their Paſſage being ſtopped that way, they flow more
plentifully into other Parts; and you might with as
much Reaſon ask why a Leaden Pipe through which
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103742:147"/>
Water is forced, does not ſwell upon the ſtraiteſt
Ligature? For conſidering the Strength of the
Nervous Coats, and that ſmall Quantity of Spirits
which circulates through them, the Force cannot be
ſufficient to diſtend them ſo powerfully, as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to make them ſwell upon a Ligature; for tho'
the Spirits, when mixed with the Blood, violently
ferment, yet when kept ſeparate in their proper
Veſſels they do not.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Page, you ſay, <hi>I take a great deal of
Pains to ſhew, that the Animal Spirits heat the Blood by
the Glandules, thoſe Emunctories of the Body.</hi> But
here Doctor, you have only ſhewed your Parts ſo far,
that you will tell Lies to make your ſelf merry; for I
am ſure I have no ſuch Words in my Book, therefore
you muſt be very much out of Order, and it is a
bad Symptom in all hot Diſtempers, eſpecially Fevers,
of the Brain, to rave ſo ſtrangely; but truly I pity
you, you not only fancy Things to be in my Book,
which are only in your own Head, but are mightily
affected with the Fumes of a <hi>Bog-houſe,</hi> which you
mention Page the 7th, which is another Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
what uſe to make of your <hi>Remarks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Page the 7th you ſay, <hi>There is not one Notion in my
Book — but what is taken either from Dr.</hi> Gibſon,

But Doctor, tho' you think fit to tell the World I have
read ſo many good Books (except the laſt) I challenge
you to ſhew my Notions were taken out of any of
them, or any others, and had you been in your
Senſes you might have ſhewn me where what I have
ſaid was to be found in thoſe Books; but I queſtion,

of your Paſſion, becauſe it is not taken notice of by
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:103742:147"/>
the Learned; for which Reaſon I have taken care to
place a Diſtance betwixt it and thoſe Authors, too
good to be nam'd with ſuch Company.</p>
                  <p>Pag. the 9th, you quote two Sentences out of my
Book, and at the ſame time dream (for ſurely you
are not awake) except you rave of Contradictions;
but ſince no body can ſee any Contradiction there,
I ſhall in ſhort tell you, that thoſe two Sentences
differ only in Words not in Signification.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Page you ſay, <hi>I have not fully replyed
to</hi> Diemerbroek <hi>nor Dr.</hi> Henſhaw, <hi>and that I am the
firſt Man that ever diſcovered cold Chyle in the Body of a
living Animal.</hi> As for what I ſaid to <hi>Diemerbroek</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Henſhaw,</hi> tho' I might have ſaid a great deal
more, yet what I have is ſufficient, and as for my
diſcovering cold Chyle in the Body of a living Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
when your Indiſpoſition is a little abated, look
into my Book and you will ſee how wild you were in
your Fit, for I don't ſay there is cold Chyle in the
Body of a living Animal, but only Pag. 66 of my
Book, <hi>He might as well have ſaid, that there is ſo great
a Diſſimilitude betwixt hot Blood and cold Milk, that as
ſoon as,</hi> &amp;c. which is as much as to ſay it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And which is only ſpoke in reference to ſuch a
Liquor without the Body; beſides, Milk is not Chyle,
nor is Chyle called Milk in the Body of a living Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</p>
                  <p>Pag. the 10th you ſay, <hi>All the Names in</hi> Europe
<hi>cannot give me the constituent Parts of a Philoſopher.</hi>
Strange! How peeviſh, crazy Pates are ſometimes!
Truly Doctor, you have hit the Nail on the Head:
Mens Names contribute very little to their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
and I ſuppoſe Children at Baptiſm are
ſcarce Philoſophers; but whether I am one or not I
ſuppoſe you are not capable of judging; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I am now, were my Name <hi>Charles Leigh</hi> I ſhould
in vain hope to be one.</p>

Pag. the 10th you ſay, <hi>I aſſert Attrition to be the
Cauſe of Fermentation, and Fermentation the Cauſe of
Nutrition,</hi> &amp;c. This is another Symptom of your
Diſtemper, and no Wonder that you, who employ
your Thoughts on <hi>Pigs, Mice,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould be ſo
ſhort-ſighted in Phyſick; but ſince Pag. the 5th you
let us underſtand, that you are a little acquainted
with Cookery, you had made a nearer Compariſon, if
you had ſaid, that when a Pot boils over, the Fire
acts on the Water, and the Water, by that Means
being forc'd out of the Pot, acts on the Fire by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it out, or to give you a plainer Inſtance of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Action and Paſſion, ſuppoſe you in one of your
Fits ſhould knock your Head againſt a Poſt for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſuch Remarks, would not your Head act upon
the Poſt, and the Poſt upon your Head? Pray think of it,
when your Fit is a little off, and conſider, that all I ſay
comes to no more, than that there is a mutual Action
and Paſſion, as I otherwiſe expreſſed it.</p>
                  <p>Pag. the 12th you pretend to quote ſome Words of
mine, where you affirm that I ſay, <hi>I have explained
an Account of</hi> the Heat of the Blood <hi>without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Proof.</hi> But had Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s Morals been as
good as his Will was prejudiced, you might have us'd
my Words, and taken notice of what followed; for
my Words are, <hi>Having premis'd an Account of the
Heat of the Blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ſhall now proceed to a Proof
of what I have propos'd collectively,</hi> &amp;c. But alas!
no wonder that one under the Influence of the Moon,
in the Company of <hi>Diego,</hi> ſhould be out of the
way.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Page and Pag. 13. you ſay, I have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
an Experiment, for inſtead of Spirit of Wine,
it ſhould be Spirit of Nitre; But Doctor, had I ſaid
Spirit of Nitre and Oyl of Turpentine would have
done ſo, it would be nothing but what was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known; and the Reaſon why I ſaid Spirit of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103742:148"/>
Wine would do ſo, was, upon very good Grounds, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
told me by a Friend whoſe Sincerity I did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
and I the ſooner believ'd it, becauſe Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> in
his Book <hi>de Fermentatione</hi> ſays thus, <hi>Spiritus Vini Phialae
incluſus nulla Efferveſcentiae ſigna prodit, ſin verò Spirtiui
huic parum Olei Terebinthinae adjiciatur Particulae Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris

but ſuppoſe he that communicated it to me was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon; it takes up but two Lines in my Book,
upon which the Proof of nothing in my Book de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
and if it did the common Experiment would
ſupply it; and that, Doctor, you might have eaſily
ſeen had you not been too intent upon your curious
Obſervations of <hi>Diego, and his</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Geeſe,</hi> and
<hi>hedging in the Cuckow;</hi> but one that had <hi>Roger of Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
in his Head, the Truth is, is very unfit to conſider
any thing that requires more Atention than your
Curioſity amongſt the <hi>Pigs, Mice, Dogs</hi> and <hi>Bog-Houſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. the 14th you take notice, that I have in my
Book, hinted at the common Indications in Fevers,
and are angry, becauſe I take no further notice of
the Method generally us'd in the Cure: But as it was
not my Buſineſs in that Place to give a fuller Account
of Fevers than to hint at the curative Indications; ſo
it is more ſufficient to ſatisfy the World that I know
what Method to take in the Cure of Fevers, than any
thing you have ſaid in your <hi>Remarks</hi> can vouch for
you; for to know the curative Indications is one
half of the Cure. But pray Doctor, why ſhould you
be angry that I have ſaid no more of Fevers than I
have? were you ſenſible of any ſuch Diſtemper in
your Brain? if you were, you might have writ to me,
and in Compaſſion to your Infirmities, I ſhould have
adviſed you; but it ſeems the Diſtemper admitted of
no Advice, but when you were angry, you muſt
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103742:149"/>
ſhew your Paſſion with ſending <hi>Geeſe, Mice, Dogs</hi>
and <hi>Elephants</hi> amongſt us; pray what Reaſon had you
to think theſe Creatures would take your Part, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you had us'd them a little more gently than to
call them ill Names?</p>
                  <p>Pag. the 15th you ſay, <hi>You would gladly know what I
mean by Acidity joyning with Acrimony; and how I will
make it out, that in Fevers the Blood is too much exalted
with Sulphur, when in malignant Fevers it's plain, the
Pulſe is moſt commonly depreſs'd and languid.</hi> Doctor,
I was glad to find this <hi>Remark</hi> amongſt the reſt; for
had it held for any time I ſhould have thought that
there had been more hopes of you, becauſe you ſeem
glad of Information; but it made me pity you when
I remembred that it is a common Obſervation, that
People ſeem a little better ſome time before Death;
and really when I found by your laſt Page, that it was
but a ſhort Remiſſion, I was affraid it was only an
<hi>Omen</hi> in a ſhort time your Lodgings would be at
<hi>Bethlem;</hi> but I beg of and earneſtly intreat all your
Friends, Neighbours and Acquaintance, that if your
Diſtemper ſhould continue, they would cloſe you up
in ſome private Apartment there; for ſhould you be
ſent to <hi>Bethlem</hi> you might infect the Place, and drive
thoſe that are indifferent, ſtark mad; pray good Dr.
keep at home for <hi>Bethlem</hi>'s ſake, and I'll tell you
what I mean by Acidity, joyning with Acrimony,
and if your Indiſpoſition will permit you, look upon
that Page again, and you'll find I mean a Liquor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of a Mixture of Acids, mixed with ſharp
Scorbutick Salts; and as for malignant Fevers, I
need not now give you my Opinion of them, the
Words in my Book being theſe, <hi>Altho' in Fevers where
the Blood abounds with too much exalted Sulphur,</hi> &amp;c.
where I only ſpeak of ſuch Fevers, in which too much
Sulphur does abound, namely in ſanguine Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ſuch as diary Fevers.</p>

In the ſame Page you ſay, <hi>Dr.</hi> Morton <hi>allows the

                  <p>Page the 16th, You ask, <hi>What are the Bladders of
the Lungs impleted with? And if ſo, how come ſome Airs
to be peſtilential, others ſcorbutick? it's plain they would
not be if the Particles of Air mixed not with the Blood.</hi> Poor
Man! In what a ſad Condition! What's become of
his Underſtanding! Good Doctor, give me leave to
ſay it's plain you are miſtaken, and don't be angry if
for once I ſpeak a little roughly; for Men in your
Condition ought to be checked ſometimes; but I
have very little Reaſon to be angry with you, and
therefore calmly let me tell you, that I don't deny
in my Book, but that the Bladders of the Lungs are
impleted with Air, and that mediately it is mixed
with the Blood; becauſe thoſe Veſſels are mixed with
the ſanguiferous Veſſels; but I ſay it is not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
mixed with the Blood, and tho' it be not, we
may eaſily underſtand, how ſome Airs become peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential,
others ſcorbutick; for tho' I deny Air to be
mixed with the Blood, yet ſince I ſay, the Nitre of
the Air is, your Queſtions are eaſily anſwered; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as that Nitre is differently impregnated with
heterogeneous Parts; ſo it will differently affect the
Maſs of Blood.</p>
                  <p>And now, good Doctor, I have taken a View of

ſince you have been pleaſed to tell me (whether it

                  <p>And truly Doctor, as for your firſt <hi>Exercitation

                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> Thing I ſhall take Notice of in this <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitation</hi>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:103742:151"/>
again, <hi>Lubens quidem agnoſco quod Hypotheſis iſta eſt

Now Doctor were you right in your Senſes, I ſhould
ask you theſe Queſtions, whether if what Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi>
writ, were Witty, or had you a Reſpect for him, it
would be a token of Reſpect due to one that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, to tell him, he takes a delight to be deceived
with Words and with their Sounds, and that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
inform a Man of Senſe, which is ſignified by <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entem,</hi>
certainly you either don't think what you ſay,
or don't care, for if you thought he deſerved reſpect
you ought to have ſhewed it him, and if you thought
his Book Witty, how comes it to be only a Sound of
Words; Doctor, are theſe Things conſiſtent? with
your own Brain Perhaps Contradictions and
Inadvertency may agree well enough, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Men of Senſe theſe Things muſt expoſe you;
beſides tho' you, even Dr. <hi>Charles Leigh,</hi> have ſaid
it, and in the Form of a Proverb too, <hi>Ignoranti nec
nocent nec Scientem juvant,</hi> betwixt Friends let me tell
you, your Proverb, tho' of your own making, won't
hold, for it is rather to be thought that to be delighted
with ſound of Words only, and to be pleaſed with he
<hi>Fallacies, Ignoranti nocent,</hi> and do't greateſt hurt to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Perſons, becauſe they make them looſe their
time without information, when ignorant Men have
leaſt Reaſon to do ſo; and this may put You in mind
to mind your Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, let us ſee a little further how your
Cariage anſwers the Character you gave of Dr. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>

look at the Sun with Spectacles at mid-day. How
now Dr. are you as angry at Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi> as you are at
Me, and can you, were you in your Senſes, tell a
Man, that you reſpect and think Witty, that he cannot
ſee the Sun at Mid-day, without Spectacles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dr.
how does ſhort Sighted, and <hi>Acerrimum</hi> agree? But
perhaps you'll ſuppoſe the Sun to be beyond a Cloud
on a foggy Day, and then indeed a Witty Man may
put on his Spectacles before he ſees it, but if you
don't ſuppoſe the Sun to be beyond a Cloud, I am
afraid you may put on your Spectacles before you ſee,
how to reconcile Short-ſighted and moſt Acute; but
perhaps when you ſay you Reſpect Dr. <hi>Liſter, Prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ingenium acerrimum,</hi> you may ſay <hi>Acerrimum</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies,
moſt Sower as well as moſt Acute, and then
indeed Short-ſighted and <hi>Acerrimum</hi> may be in the
ſame Man; but then I ſhould ask you how came you
to reſpect a Man that is Short-ſighted and <hi>Acerrimum
i. e. moſt Sower,</hi> was it for your own ſake? Truly
I believe ſo, for there are too many inſtances in your
Book as well as <hi>Remarks,</hi> that you are a ſhrowd
Short-ſighted Man. But perhaps you'll challenge me
to ſhew you one! If ſo you are more Short-ſighted
than I thought you was, good Doctor, read over this
Anſwer from the beginning, and you'll find enough,
and if you'll ſtay a while you ſhall have more than
you can wiſh for.</p>
                  <p>But before we go any further let us ſee what other
Methods you take to expreſs your Reſpect to Dr. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
Propter ingenium acerrimum.</hi> Page 9 you reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

than that Wheat which fell out of the Clouds from
the middle Region, of which trifling Philoſophers
rave ſo much; O fye Doctor! By no means call your

Judge you are much miſtaken; for they are ſo far from
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:103742:152"/>
thinking you are a trifling Philoſopher, that they
poſitively ſay in <hi>London</hi> that you are no Philoſopher
at all: But perhaps you'll ask me where do you call
your ſelf a trifling Philoſopher, if you do, I ſhall
ask you, whether if you call thoſe that rave of this
Wheat, trifling Philoſophers, you don't call your
ſelf one ſince it's plain you rave beyond meaſure:
And here Doctor let me ask you how you came to
throw a ſhowe of Wheat upon Dr. <hi>Lister,</hi> it ſeems
you ſerve him and me alike, only ſince you writ

a great deal of Wit is lodged; theſe ſort of

throw ſo much Dirt at them, for this was to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
your own Book, had you conſider'd, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was your Kindneſs for your own Notions
that made you be ſo foul upon them; for by Dr. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
one may ſee you abuſe what you reverence, or
you cannot endure to ſee your own Picture, but that
you may not fall out with my Book, becauſe you
think it hath ſomething out of yours, I tell you

of this Exercitation againſt Dr. <hi>Liſter,</hi> Page
the 4th you ſay, <hi>In Puteis juxta Haigh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> in
the Wells near <hi>Haigh</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire;</hi> for there is a
true vitriolated Fountain, which if any, runs with a
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:103742:153"/>
gentle Current, which by repeated Experiments
I have demonſtrated to be full of Vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and

Water, near <hi>Boulton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi>—&amp;c.
from thence you will obtain Shoots of Vitriol;
from whence and the reſt of this Exercitation, it
appears that you have argu'd very ſtrongly to prove
that acidulated Waters have Acids in them, and you
had need to be a mighty Diſputant to gain ſuch a
Point, and ſurely Dr. <hi>Roe</hi> could not chooſe but
laugh to ſee you ſo buſy to prove nothing, certainly
<hi>Smiglicius</hi> qualify'd you for ſuch Diſcoveries; for to
prove methodically and convincingly, that Water
acidulated hath Acids in it, is really a Matter as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
as to prove that the Well near <hi>Haigh</hi> in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire</hi>
hath Water in it, and truly no wonder that
you convinced Dr. <hi>Floyer;</hi> for the thing is plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
for Example, if the Well have Water in
it, there muſt needs be Water in the Well, and if
the Water be Acid there muſt needs be Acid in the
Water, what Reaſoning can be ſtronger? What
Evidence more clear? Strike up Doctor, for the
Credit of <hi>Bethlem</hi> and the Town of <hi>Mancheſter;</hi>
and be it publiſhed to the World that by Parity of
Reaſon Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> effectually prov'd, that all Malt
Drink hath Malt in it, for Example, if acidulated
Waters conſiſt of Water and Acids, all acidulated
Waters have Acids in them, and therefore by Parity
of Reaſon it follows, that if Ale be made of Malt
and Water, all Ale muſt have Malt in it, a Diſcovery
of great Uſe to Brewers, Doctor, who would ever
here thought of ſuch a Diſcovery as this beſides your
ſelf, I mean who would ever have thought it a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,

                     </hi> or did he take it
from you, think of it and when you do remember,
that his Book was writ long before yours, but again,
look back to Page the 32 of your own Book, where
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:103742:154"/>
you quote theſe Words from Monſieur <hi>le Grand,
Provenit ergò Thermarum calor à Bituminis &amp; Sulphuris
Miſturâ, quae dum inter ſe confunduntur, per quandam
Fermentationem Calorem concipiunt,</hi> i. e. The Heat
therefore of hot Baths proceeds from a Bitumen and
Sulphur, which whilſt they are mixed acquire Heat
by Fermentation, now Doctor, what does this differ
from your Opinion, you ſay Heat depends on a
Mixture of ſulphureous Particles, ſo does
<hi>le Grand;</hi> for a Mixture of Bitumen and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
is but one ſulphureous Body with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
now it is ſtrange that Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſhould
be ſo angry at me when he hath ſo much more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be angry at himſelf, and really he is ſo; for when
Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> ſays, Heat proceeds from Sulphur, and <hi>le
Grand</hi> is of the ſame Opinion, Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> cannot bear
it, he contradicts them, and keeps the Reaſons to

as his own, he thinks he hath done well; phy! Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
I thought you had not been quite ſo crazy, if

                  <p>And now Doctor, muſt not this argue that your
Brain is extreamly hot, that you cannot diſcern your

are further Inſtances than this, nothing will ſerve

of the Heat of the Blood is to be compar'd to

of the Heat of hot Baths is widely different from
the formal Cauſe of the Heat of the Blood, for the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:103742:155"/>
Heat of Baths according to Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> depends on a
Mixture and Fermentation of ſulphureous Parts,
but the Heat of the Blood (I ſay) depends on a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and mutual Fermentation of animal Spirits and
Blood, which Account in my Treatiſe is different
from all others yet laid down, and which I believe I
have ſufficiently proved, and if what I have ſaid
will not be ſufficient to prove Truth, I conceive I
am furniſhed with Reaſons which will, which I did
not lay down in my Book, becauſe what is there is
enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N. B.</hi> That where I have ſaid the Heat is cauſed
ſo, or otherwiſe, I mean a Power to cauſe ſuch a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
upon our Senſory; for Fire is not actually hot
in it ſelf, but as it affects our Senſory, as I have
proved in my Treatiſe of the Reaſon of the Heat
of the Blood.</p>
                  <p>But how came I to forget I was talking to Dr.
<hi>Leigh,</hi> Doctor, I beg your Pardon for being ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and for talking of Reaſon, I did not remember
ſuch Talk would diſturb your Head, come, come,

                  <p>Your next Exercitation, Doctor, contains an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect

Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> and you both agree, that there is too much
Salt in the Blood in intermitting Fevers, &amp; now you ſee
how much you are miſtaken, for in your <hi>Remarks</hi> you

but tho' you don't know your ſelf, Doctor, one
would think you might know your own Book, but
how ſhould you, when it's plain you don't know

but perhaps there may be another Reaſon why you
cry <hi>experto crede Roberto,</hi> becauſe <hi>Carolo</hi> would not

                  <p>I come laſt of all, to your laſt <hi>Exercitation,</hi> and

you for, but Dr. is this a Production of yours,
that in your <hi>Remarks</hi> could divide betwixt the <hi>North</hi>

pleaſe, you are baſely miſtaken, tho' you don't know
where, and therefore in compaſſion to you I ſhall
ſhow you your Faults; for the obſtruction of the
Glandules of the Liver are an Effect of an Hydropical
Diſpoſition, and by no means the Cauſe of it, for
as long as the Humors are in a right State, they paſs
through thoſe Parts without Obſtruction, but when
for want of Spirits and good Blood, an Hydropical
Diſpoſition is brought on, then the Blood degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
into a more phlegmatick State, conſequently
obſtructs the Glandules, ſo that it is evident, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
proceeds the Obſtruction, the Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cannot be the Cauſe of what went before.</p>
                  <p>And now Dr. I have taken a ſhort View of your

                  <p>And here Doctor, I cannot but admire, why you
ſhould be ſo angry with every Body that is not of
your Mind, and of Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s Opinion; for we may
obſerve that you are not only very angry at me, but
even with Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi> whom you Reverence; but
why ſhould I wonder at it, it is the Nature of Men in
your Condition, and truly I pity it withal my Heart,
and am ſorry that you have loſt the Uſe of your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>And Doctor, may I ask you this Queſtion, what
Reaſon have you now to complain of my Age?
And pray who is the younger Phyſitian, I don't ſay
the younger Man, you have long enjoyed a head which
I by no means envy you for, may the <hi>Pudenda

very agreeable Company, only conſider whether you
are not too near it already. Pray do, and keep out of
<hi>Bethlem</hi> if you can.</p>
                  <p>But Doctor, how came you to write your <hi>Remarks</hi>
in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I thought you had too great Thoughts of
your ſelf to writ any thing in <hi>Engliſh</hi> vvas it becauſe
vvhen you vvere peeviſh and croſs in <hi>Latin</hi> no Body
took notice of you, if ſo, really you have got your ſelf
taken notice of vvith a Witneſs, for vvhen I received
your <hi>Remarks</hi> at <hi>Brazen-Noſe,</hi> having never ſeen
ſuch ſtuff in Print before, I vvas very inquiſitive to
knovv vvhat Part of the World liked it, and vvhat
they ſaid of it, vvherefore I asked the Opinion of a
fevv of the Younger ſort, and truly they told me they
thought ſuch things had never been Printed, but it
made them Laugh heartily; but vvhen I conſulted
Men of Senſe, they adviſed me not to take notice of
ſuch Nonſenſe, and truly Doctor, I had taken their
advice, but vvhen about a Month ago I came to
<hi>London</hi> and heard that Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> vvas the Jeſt of the
merry Philoſophers of the Tovvn, and that you had
ſo miſerably expoſed your ſelf as to be taken for a

<hi>Bethlem</hi> or a Keeper.</p>
                  <p>But I have Reaſon to think, that there is another
Reaſon why you writ your <hi>Remarks</hi> in <hi>Engliſh, viz.
Ob defectum alterius</hi> to Uſe your own Phraſe. This
Dr. Perhaps may ſtartle you, but for all you have writ
a Book in <hi>Latin</hi> it's true; and you have Reaſon
enough to write in <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the future, for when

                  <p>Again, Page 64 and 66, we may obſerve, what a

a Cure, and therefore to cloſe up this occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Enquiry, I ſhall tranſcribe a Piece of Advice for
you, from a very good Author, but ſhall not tell you
the Name of it, leaſt you ſhould Burn it; for Mad Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are very apt to throw away their Medicines. The
Words are theſe, <hi>I believe you are quite out of your
Wits, and are run away from your Keepers, and therefore—I
adviſe you to Shave all the Hair very cloſe off
your Crown. Then take away fifty or threeſcore Ounces of
Blood, at ſeveral times, according as it ſhall be found, that
you come to your ſelf, and to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of your Reaſon, if you
make uſe of Leaches be ſure they be well cleanſed, if you
Purge, uſe very gentle things, ſuch as</hi> Manna <hi>and Syrup of
Roſes, which they give to Madmen, till your Diſtemper
abates, avoid all ſtrong Meats, Tobacco, hot Spices and
eſpecially Coffee, for the Powder hath ſometimes been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to ſettle into a</hi> Saracens-<hi>head in the bottom of the Diſh,
and above all things have a great care of Studying, or of
Writing Books, till your Head is better, and of Sleeping
on your Back; for Vapours will be apt to riſe and you'll
Dream of nothing but</hi> Elephants, Mice, Bog-houſes,
<hi>Diego</hi> and his Geeſe, and <hi>Roger</hi> a <hi>Coverly.</hi> When you
have followed theſe Directions for a while, you will
be better able to underſtand my Book, to ſee your
own Errors, and will be fitter to go to School again;
for in the Condition you are in, you are fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
pray Doctor, don't refuſe to take Advice, for
your Condition is deſperate, you need not fall out
with the Directions, becauſe they are mine, for that
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103742:159"/>
you might not make that Objection, I have taken care
to tranſcribe Advice from one that I hope you have no

            <p>SOON after I had writ the preceding Sheets,
wherein I have traced the Symptoms of the
Doctors Diſtemper: I heard that Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> had writ
a Reply to Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> his Piece concerning the Cure
of a Perſon bit by a Viper, and therefore conſidering
the Doctors, and his Adverſaries Conditions both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
I thought it adviſable and prudent to take a
View of it, before the Publiſhing of what I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
writ, for ſeveral Reaſons: For ſince I have
made it appear how much the Doctor is diſtempered,
and in order to his Recovery have preſcribed Rules,
I thought it not amiſs to ſee whether his Diſtemper
was either abated or increaſed, that I might accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
if there was occaſion, alter thoſe Rules laid
down for his Recovery; but I find that the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
are yet as ſtrong and the Method preſcrib'd by
no means to be neglected.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> Symptom is a Copy of Verſes, which
fills the ſixth Page, where both by his Rhiming and the
Excellency of his Poetick Strain, it appears he is almoſt,
if not quite, paſt hopes, for what more evident Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
can there be of Madneſs than for a Man to turn
Poet, who cannot write good <hi>Engliſh;</hi> indeed, had
his whole Book been filled up with ſuch Poetry I
ſhould have thought him much wiſer, for he would
get more credit by writing Ballads than ſcribling
Phyſick, it being a more fit Employment for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a conſiderable Number of them might have gone
off throughout the Kingdom, and eſpecially this
St. <hi>Bartholemews</hi> Fair in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:103742:160"/>
But it is in vain to adviſe the Doctor, a crazy Pate hath
as indeterminate Faculties as a <hi>neutral Spirit,</hi> a Spirit
of Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s Denomination; Spirits which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Doctor converſes with <hi>in agro Lancaſtrienſi;</hi>
but I would willingly be certain, what the Doctor
means by a Neutral Spirit, and how he came to give
Spirit ſuch an odd Epithite as Neutral, but I cannot
expect an Anſwer from one that knows not the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt Queſtions and Anſwers, and one that
is in ſuch a raving Condition too, for after his Poetry,
the next <hi>Remark</hi> is upon the <hi>Owl in a Crab-tree; O
Ingenium Acerrimum! Nihil ſeveriori ſcrutinio dignum
reperiri poteſt, nec quid quod Philoſophorum mentes adeo
diſtorſit, Quin<expan>

having diſtracted himſelf with hot Baths, hath fallen
foul upon the Crab-tree, and perhaps reſpects it for
it's ſower Qualities, or in the Doctors own Words
<hi>propter Ingenium Acerrimum,</hi> but why ſhould the

where the Doctor's Judgment failed him, ſhould
have ſuch hard Fate as falling into the Hands of Dr.
<hi>Leigh,</hi> but who can otherwiſe think of its Uſage in
ſuch Hands. He that againſt Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi> brought a
Shower of Wheat and Goats Wooll, and in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi>
on ME rav'd of nothing, but <hi>Elephants, Pigs,
Mice, Cheeſemongers,</hi> Diego <hi>and</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Geeſe,</hi> &amp;c.
may well take a Touch with the Owl and Crab-tree.</p>
            <p>But theſe Symptoms are not all, Page 12. He hath
brought the Grand Seignior into a Jeſt, and well then
may he fall foul upon the King's Subjects, Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi>
and I, may well be affraid of a Man that dare jeſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Grand Seignior, but, like ſtormy Weather,
ſometimes he's at the Top of the Houſe, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as low again; for Page 14 he ridicules the poor

            <p>And after all this, Page 24, He reckons himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

does not mean Phyſicians, but <hi>Hawkers, Cheeſemongers,

                  </expan> Exercitationes,</hi> it is plain, that he
hath employed his Thoughts moſt on ſuch Subjects as
thoſe Tradeſmen are employed about.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding thoſe Symptoms which are
ſtill Arguments of the Doctors Diſtemper, yet this I
muſt needs ſay, the Combat betwixt Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> and
him may be diverting; for Folly and Madneſs at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
will be hard match'd, and really were not Dr.
<hi>Leigh's</hi> Condition very deſperate, it would be adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to let him enjoy his Diſtemper a little longer,
otherwiſe Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> will be too hard for him; for
tho' I have ſo ſlight an Opinion of Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> as to
think him miſtaken in every thing he writes, and
very unfit for an Author, yet by all means he is to be
preferred before Dr. <hi>Leigh;</hi> for Folly is not ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
as Madneſs; but as for Mr. <hi>Tuthil</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Leigh</hi> let them go together with all my Heart.</p>
            <p>And I have only this more to obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tuthil</hi> in this reſpect are all
alike, for firſt Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> hath caſt a great many of
baſe Reflections on the College of Phyſicians; for
which he deſerves worſe Uſage himſelf, becauſe they
gave him no Reaſon for it, but he hath given them
Reaſon, becauſe he hath abuſed them: To be even with
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:103742:161"/>
him; Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> hath reflected on the College and the
Univerſity, becauſe they would not Licenſe his <hi>Quin<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>
Exercitationes,</hi> and hath reflected on me, and is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
becauſe I have had better Fortune than himſelf;
where he hath reflected on me without Reaſon, for
which I have juſt Cauſe to pitty him; again Mr. <hi>Tuthil,</hi>
to be even with them both, hath complemented Mr.
<hi>Colbatch</hi> moſt unmercifully, as if Complements were
made for ſuch Creatures, and Pearls to be caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Swine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Similitude betwixt Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Leigh</hi> runs farther: For Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> in his Preface to this
<hi>Reply,</hi> pretends to ſtand up for the Honour of Phyſick,
yet in his <hi>Remarks</hi> reflects on the moſt Honourable of
them. Again Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of the Gout,</hi> tells
the World, <hi>Phyſick is a Scene of Slaughter,</hi> and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to complement our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phyſicians, or at leaſt
the Phyſicians of <hi>London,</hi> as Men of the greateſt Merit,
and the Parallel runs ſo far betwixt theſe two, that
I may well ſay Folly and Madneſs will never be more
conſpicuous, and therefore I wiſh the one the Uſe of
his Reaſon, and the other Senſe enough to diſcern his
Errors, and ſhall only add, that I beg Pardon of the
World for taking notice of either of them, and I
hope my Compaſſion to them will not by the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
be miſtaken for a Fault, ſince I hope I have writ
nothing, but what the Ignorance of the one, and the
Ignorance and Envy of the other, have given juſt
Grounds for.</p>
