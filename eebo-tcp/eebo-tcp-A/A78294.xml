         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The humble <hi>PETITION</hi> of <hi>Wlliam

for the propagating of the

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all humble manner ſheweth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your approved wiſedomes, the
great and generall neglect of this
Kingdome, in not propagating
the glorious Goſpel in <hi>America,</hi> a
maine part of the world: Indeed the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the worke is (in the generall) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123668:3"/>
pious and charitable; but the ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
that hath hitherto beene made of it,
either by us, or others, having (as yet) never
beene generally undertaken in pitty to mens
ſoules, but in hope to poſſeſſe the land of thoſe
Infidels, or of gaine by Commerce, may well
make this and all other Chriſtian Kingdomes
confeſſe, they have beene exceeding remiſſe in
performing this ſo religious, ſo great, ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
a worke.</p>
            <p>May it therefore pleaſe your wiſedomes to
give your <hi>Petitioner</hi> leave to propoſe briefly, (as
the nature of a Petition requireth the more
then ordinary piety, and charity of the worke;
the evident neceſſity, and benefit of underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
together with the eaſineſſe of effecting.</p>
            <p>A greater expreſſion of piety (your <hi>Petitioner</hi>
conceiveth) there cannot be, then to make God
known where he was never ſpoken nor thought
of, to advance the Scepter of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And now againe to reduce thoſe, who
(at firſt) were created after the Image of God
from the manifeſt worſhip of devils. To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
and adore the bleſſed Trinitie in
Vnity, to doe this, is to be happy Inſtruments of
effecting thoſe often repeated promiſes of God,
in making all nations bleſſed by the comming
of Chriſt, and by ſending his word to all lands: It
is to inlarge greatly the pale of the Church.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:123668:3"/>
And to make thoſe (who were the moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Synagogues of Sathan) delightfull Temples
of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>It was a high point of piety in the Queen of
the South, to come from the utmoſt parts of the
world to heare the wiſedome of <hi>Salomon.</hi> And
ſo it was in <hi>Abraham,</hi> to leave his native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
for the better, and more free ſervice of his
God.</p>
            <p>And certainely it will bee eſteemed no leſſe in
thoſe, who (either in their perſons or purſes)
ſhall religiouſly endeavour to make millions of
thoſe ſilly ſeduced <hi>Americans,</hi> to heare, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
and practiſe the myſterie of godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>And as is the piety, ſuch is the charity of the
worke, exceeding great, to no leſſe then the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
ſoules of innumerable men, who ſtill
ſit in darkeneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death,
continually aſſaulted and devoured by the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
whoſe greateſt delight is to bring others
with himſelfeinto the ſame irrecoverable gulfe
of perdition, what thoſe blind and ſpirituall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed
<hi>Americans</hi> are, we were, and ſo had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
had not Apoſtolicall men afforded greater
charity unto us, <hi>Diviſis orbe Britannis,</hi> by long
Iourneying, and not without great hazard of
their lives, then (as yet) hath beene ſhewed by
us unto them.</p>
            <p>Wee are not indeed indued with ſuch
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:123668:4"/>
eminent extraordinary gifts, as were the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Chriſtians; but yet (if it be duly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
how fully and how purely God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
his Goſpel unto this Iland, how miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly,
hee hath lately protected us from Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Invafions, and Popiſh conſpiracies; and
how (at this time) wee abound in ſhipping, and
all manner of proviſion for Sea: It will bee
found, that we (of all nations) are moſt for the
worke, and moſt ingaged to doe it in due thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
to God.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Arme of the Lord ſhortned, or his
wonted bounty ſo reſtrained, but that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the voyage principally for Gods glory,
and in compaſſion to mens ſoules, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a more then an ordinary bleſſing from him,
whoſe uſuall cuſtome is to honour thoſe that
honour him, and moſt abundantly even in this
life, to recompence ſuch religious underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings.</p>
            <p>The Spaniard boaſteth much of what hee
hath already done in this kind, but their owne
Authors report their unchriſtian behaviour,
eſpecially their monſtrous cruelties to be ſuch,
as they cauſed the Infidels to deteſt the name of
Chriſt. Your wiſedomes may judge of the
Lyon by his claw. In one of their Ilands
called <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> of 200000 of men, as <hi>Benzo</hi>
(in his Italian Hiſtorie) affirmeth, they had not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:123668:4"/>
left 150 ſoules. And <hi>Lipſius</hi> juſtly complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
that whereſoever they came, they cut
downe men as they did corne without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.
And as for thoſe that ſurvived, they
bought their lives at deare rates: for they put
them to beare, their carriages from place to
place; and if they fayled by the way, they either
miſerably diſmembred, or killed them out-right.
They lodged them like bruite beaſts under the
planks of their ſhips, till their fleſh rotted from
their backs: And if any failed in the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of his daily taske, hee was ſure to bee
whipped till his body diſtilled with goar blood,
and then poured they in either molten pitch or
ſcalding oyle to ſupple him.</p>
            <p>A very ſtrange, and unlikely way to worke
Infidels unto the faith, neither yet could they
(if they would) impart unto others the Goſpel
in the truth and purity thereof, who have it not
themſelves, but very corruptly, accompanied
with many idle, abſurd, idolatrous Inventions
of their owne, which are but as ſo many ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures
wickedly oppreſſing, if not utterly
ſubverting the very foundations of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>And although ſome of the reformed religion,
<hi>Engliſh, Scotch, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> have already
taken up their habitations in thoſe parts, yet
hath their going thither (as yet) beene to ſmall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:123668:5"/>
purpoſe, for the converting of thoſe nations,
either for that they have placed themſelves but
in the skirts of <hi>America,</hi> where there are but
few natives (as thoſe of new <hi>England,</hi> or elſe
for want of able and conſcionable Miniſters (as
in <hi>Virginia)</hi> they themſelves are become exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rude, more likely to turne Heathen, then to
turne others to the Chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there is a little or no hope our Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
there ſhould be of any long continuance,
ſince here in <hi>England</hi> for ſome yeares laſt paſt,
they have beene rather diverſly hindred, then
any wayes furthered, how, and by whom, your
wiſedomes, either have or will ſhortly find out,
but this is evident that the proud ſuperſtitious
Spaniard (who hateth their religion, and feareth
their neighbours, will ſpare them no longer
then (to his over-ſwelling greatneſſe) ſhall ſeem
good: And in the judgement of moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Travellers that way, they may (if they
will) eaſily enough ſuppreſſe and deſtroy all
other our Plantations, as they did of late, that
of Saint <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> when they were no way
provoked by us, as they will now pretend they
are, by a latter taking of <hi>Trinidado,</hi> and the
loſſe of more then 150. of their men there. At
leaſt they will bee ſure to be deſperately aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as was the Ile of <hi>Providence,</hi> but the yeare
laſt paſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:123668:5"/>
Whence your Petitioner offereth unto your
Honourable conſiderations a third Argument
(drawne from meere neceſſity) that as you ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the happy proceeding of thoſe (as yet) but
weakely ſetled Plantations. the liberties, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
and lives of many thouſands our deare
brethren, and countrey men: And which is yet,
more the proſperous progreſs of the goſpel, you
would be pleaſed to conſult of ſuch an able and
ſpeedy ſupply, as may ſecure them againſt the
now expected cruelty of the Spaniard.</p>
            <p>To which needfull ſupply the better and
ſooner to induce your wiſedomes, your Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
deſireth your yet a little further patience,
untill hee hath ſhewed ſome temporall benefits
that are thereby like to acrew unto this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
together with the eaſineſſe of effecting.</p>
            <p>When a Kingdom beginneth to be over-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
with a multitude of people (as <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Scotland</hi> now do) to have a convenient place
where to ſend forth Coloniesis no ſmal benefit:
And ſuch are the North-eaſt and North-weſt
parts of <hi>America,</hi> betweene the degrees of 25.
and 45. of the North latitude, which, at this
time doe even offer themſelves unto us, to bee
protected by us, againſt the knowne cruelty of
the over-neare approaching Spaniard.</p>
            <p>A very large tract of ground containing ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:123668:6"/>
healthfull, pleaſant, and fruitfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
not only apt, but already provided of all
things neceſſary for mans ſuſtentation, Corne,
Graſſe, and wholſome cattell in good compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie;
but Fiſh, Fowle, Fruits and Herbes in
abundant variety.</p>
            <p>If wee ſhould looke no further, then the
South of <hi>Virginia,</hi> (which is our owne) wee
ſhall find there all manner of proviſion for
life, beſides Merchantable Commodities, Silke,
Vines, Cotton, Tobacco, Deer-skins, Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins,
rich Furre, and Beavers good ſtore, Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Braſſe, Iron, Pitch, Tarre, Roſin and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all things neceſſary for ſhipping, which if
they ſhall bee employed that way; they who
are ſent away may (with Gods bleſſing) within
ſhort time in due recompence of their ſetting
forth, returne this Kingdome ſtore of ſilver and
gold, pearles and precious ſtones; for undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
(if there be not a generall miſtake in all
Authors, who have written of theſe places)
ſuch treaſure is to bee had, if not there, yet in
places not farre remote, where (as yet) the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
hath nothing to doe. And in caſe the
Spaniard will bee troubleſome to our Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or ſhall (as it is generally conceived)
bee found an Enemy to this Kingdome, there
is no way more likely to ſecure <hi>England,</hi> then by
having a ſtrong Navie there; hereby wee
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:123668:6"/>
may come to ſhare, if not utterly to defeat him
of that vaſte Indian Treaſure, wherewith hee
ſetteth on fire ſo great a part of the Chriſtian
World, corrupteth many Counſellors of
ſtate, ſupporteth the Papacie, and generally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexeth
all reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>Nor need any ſcrupulous quere bee made,
whether wee may not aſſault an enemy in any
place, or not eſteeme them ſuch as ſhall aſſault
us in thoſe places, where wee have as much
to doe as they. The Spaniard claimeth indeed
an Intereſt, little leſſe then hereditarie in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all <hi>America,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> but it is
but by vertue of the Popes grant, which is
nothing worth, as was long ſince determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her Councell;
ſo as for the Spaniard to debarre us in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of our Plantations, or freedome of
commerce in thoſe ſpacious countries, were
over proudly to take upon him; and for us to
permit it were over-much to yeeld of our own
right.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially, when we may, as now we may,
ſo eaſily helpe our ſelves: For your Petitioner
conceiveth there is no great difficulty in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
here, or tediouſneſſe in the paſſage
thither, or hazard when wee come there. The
preparation of men and ſhipping, in reſpect of
the daily happy expected accord betweene us
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:123668:7"/>
and the <hi>Scots,</hi> is (upon the matter) already
made; and as for money it is in the power of
this Honourable Houſe to give ſufficient, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any grievance, or diſlike of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
who (undoubtedly) in the generall
will thinke nothing grievous, which ſhall bee
concluded by your wiſedomes, expedient to
ſuch a pious and charitable worke.</p>
            <p>And as for the paſſage, how can it be thought
either tedious or dangerous. it being ordinarily
but ſix weekes ſayle, in a ſea much more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from Pirats, and much more free from
ſhipwrack, and enemies coaſts, then our ten or
twelve moneths voyage into the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
And as for our good ſucceſſe there, wee need
not feare it. The natives being now every
where more then ever, out of an inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
to the Spaniard, ready and glad to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
us. Our beſt friends the Netherlanders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with eight and twenty ſhips gone before
to aſſiſt and further us. And which is much
more, our going with a generall conſent in
Gods cauſe, for the promoting of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and inlarging of his Church, may aſſure
us of a more then ordinary protection and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
That hitherto wee have beene leſſe
ſucceſſefull in our voyage that way, wee may
juſty impute it to this, that as yet they have
not beene undertaken with ſuch a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:123668:7"/>
and with ſuch a full reference to Gods
glory as was requiſite.</p>
            <p>And ſo your Petitioner having delivered his
apprehenſion herein more briefely, then ſo
weighty a matter might well require, hee
ſubmits all the premiſes to your more full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
and concluſion, which hee humbly
prayeth, may bee with all convenient ſpeed;
the onely beſt way under God to make
it the better ſucceſſefull.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:123668:8"/>
WEe whoſe names are here under-writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
having beene upon occaſion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with a motion intended to bee made
by Maſter <hi>William Caſtell,</hi> Parſon of <hi>Courtenhall</hi>
in the county of <hi>Northampton,</hi> to the High and
honourable Court of Parliament now aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
concerning the propagation of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Goſpel of Chriſt in <hi>America.</hi> As wee
doe well approve of the motion; ſo we doe
humbly deſire his reaſons may bee duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:
And ſo good a worke furthered their
wiſer judgements may reſolve upon, to which
we humbly ſubmit the ſame.</p>
