            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E do fully agree without haeſitation, That theſ Scriptures cited in the margent of your Paper, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3. 3 <hi>John</hi> 9. 10. do prove, That the Apoſtles did ordaine Presbyters and Deacons, give rules concerning Chriſtian Diſcipline, and had power of exerciſing cenſures over Presbyters and others; and that theſe places of Scripture, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 10. do prove, That <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had power to ordaine Presbyters and Deacons, and to exerciſe Cenſures over others; and that the ſecond and third Chapters of the <hi>Revelations</hi> do prove, That the Angels of the Churches had power of governing of the Churches, and exerciſing Cenſures: But that either the Apoſtles, or <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> or the Angels of the Churches were Biſhops, as Biſhops are diſtinct from Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, exerciſing Epiſcopall Government in that ſenſe; or that the Apoſtles did commit and derive to any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as their Subſtitutes and Succeſſors, any ſuch Epiſcopall Government; or that this is proved in the leaſt meaſure by the Scriptures alleadged, we do as fully deny; And therefore do humbly deny alſo, That Epiſcopall Government is therefore moſt conſonant to the Word of God, and of Apoſtolicall inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or proved ſo to be by theſe Scriptures. None of theſe were Biſhops, or practiſed Epiſcopall Government, as Biſhops are diſtinct from Presbytery; neither is ſuch an Officer of the Church as a Biſhop diſtinct from a Presbyter, to be found in the new Teſtament (by which we humbly conceive, That our faith and conſcience touching this point ought to be concluded: The Name, Office, and worke of Biſhop and Presbyter being one and the ſame in all things, and never in the leaſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht, as is cleerely evident, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5, 7. <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in Creete, that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordaine Presbyters in every City, as I had appointed thee, for a Biſhop muſt be blameleſſe.</hi> In which place the Apoſtles reaſoning were altogether invalid and inconſequent, if Presbyter and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116882:4"/>
Biſhop were not the ſame Office, as well as they have the ſame name.</p>
            <p>The ſame is manifeſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 20 17, 28. And from <hi>Miletus</hi> he ſent to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and called the Presbyters of the Church, to whom he gave this charge, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the flocks over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Biſhops; to feed and governe the Church of God:</hi> Where we obſerve, That the Apoſtle being to leave theſe Presbyters, and never to ſee their faces more, <hi>verſ.</hi> 38. doth charge them with the feeding and governing of the Church, as being Biſhops of the Holy Ghoſts making: But that the Holy Ghoſt did make any ſuperiour or higher kinde of Biſhops than theſe common Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, is not to be found in that, or any other Text.</p>
            <p>And that under the mouth of two or three witneſſes this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of ours may ſtand; we adde to what we have already ſaid, That in the firſt of <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 1, 2. <hi>The Presbyters which are among you, I exhort, who am alſo a Presbyter, feed the flock of God which is among you; Performing the Office of Biſhops.</hi> Where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares plaine to us, That under the words uſed in this place, is expreſt whatſoever worke the Presbyters do, more for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or good of the Church, otherwiſe than is there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly enjoyned unto Presbyters. By all which that hath been ſaid, The point is rendered moſt cleare to the judgement of moſt men, both ancient and of latter times, That there is no ſuch Officer to be found in the Scriptures of the new Teſtament, as a Biſhop diſtinct from a Presbyter: Neither doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture afford us the leaſt notice of any qualification required in a Biſhop, that is not required in a Presbyter; nor any Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Office of a Biſhop, diſtinct from a Presbyter; nor any worke or duty charged upon a Biſhop, which Presbyters are not enjoyned to do; nor any greater honour or dignity put upon them. For that double honour which the Apoſtles ſpeake of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>As due to Presbyters that rule well,</hi> is with a note of eſpecially affixed to that act or worke of labouring in the Word of Doctrine; which is not that act wherein Biſhops have challenged a ſingularity or peculiar eminency above the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</p>
            <p>To that which your Majeſty doth conceive, That Epiſcopall Government was practiſed by Apoſtles themſelves; We hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

1 And firſt to that of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> we grant, That <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had authority and power of ordaining Presbyters and Deacons, and of exerciſing cenſures over Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and others, though we cannot ſay they had this power as the Apoſtles Subſtitutes or Succeſſors in Epiſcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor that they exerciſed the power they had, as being Biſhops in the ſence of your Majeſtie, but as extraordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers or Evangeliſts, which Evangeliſts were an Office in the Church, diſtinct from Paſtors and Teachers, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 4. 11. And that they were Evangeliſts, it appeares by their being ſent up and downe by the Apoſtles, or taken along with them in company to ſeverall Churches, as the neceſſity and occaſion of the Church did require; the one of them being expreſly called an Evangeliſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. And neither of them being any where in Scriptures called Biſhop, neither were they fixed to <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> as Biſhops in the Churches committed to them, but removed from thence to other places, and never, for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in Scriptures, returned to them againe: And it ſeemes cleare to us, that neither their abode at <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Creet</hi> was for any long time, nor ſo intended by the Apoſtle, for he imployes them there upon occaſionall buſineſſe, and expreſſeth himſelfe in ſuch manner, <hi>(I beſought thee to abide ſtill at</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus, <hi>when I went into</hi> Macedonia, <hi>that thou mighteſt charge ſome, that they teach no other Doctrine,</hi> 1 Timothy 13. <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in</hi> Creet, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. As doth not carry the fixing or conſtituting of a Biſhop in a place as a perpetuall Governour: And it is as manifeſt, that they were both of them called away from theſe places, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 9 <hi>Do thy diligence to come to me ſhortly, Titus,</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Be diligent to come to me to</hi> Nicapolis; ſo that they may as well be called Biſhops of other Citie, or Church where they had any conſiderable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, as they are pretended to have beene of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> as they are called by the Poſtſcripts of theſe Apoſtles, the credit of which Poſtſcripts we cannot build upon in this point.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, to that of the Angels of the Churches, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Churches are called Stars and Angels, which Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations are Metaphoricall and a Miſterie, <hi>Rev. el</hi> 1. 20.

               </gap> in reſpect of their ſtation and ſhining. And it ſeemes ſtrange to us, that ſo many expreſſe teſtimonies of Scriptures, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legoricall denominations or myſteries ſhould be oppoſed; Theſe Angels being no where called Biſhops in vulgar acceptation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the word Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop vſed in any of <hi>Johns</hi> writings, who cals himſelf Presbiter, nor any mention of ſuperiority of one Presbiter to another, but in <hi>Diotrophes</hi> effecting it. And as to that which may be ſaid that Epiſtles are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one; We anſwer that an number of perſons are in the myſterious and Prophetique writings expreſt in ſingulars. And we humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that being written in an Epiſtolary ſtile (for they are as Letters or Epiſtles to the Churches) theſe writings are directed as Letters to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective or repreſentative bodies uſe to be; that is to one, but are intended and meant to the body in meeting aſſembled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which that they were ſo intended, is cleare to us, both becauſe there were in <hi>Epheſus</hi> Biſhops, and Presbiters one and the ſame, to whom the Apoſtle at his farewell commended the Government of the Church, and by divers expreſſions in theſe Epiſtles, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>To you and to the reſt in Thyatira,</hi> by which diſtinction of you and the reſt, we conceive the Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (which were more then one) and the people to be ſignified, and ſo cannot conſent that any ſingular perſon had majority over the reſt, or ſole power of exerciſing Church cenſures and Government ſpoken of in theſe Chapters.</p>
            <p>Having thus (as we humbly conceive) proved by pregnant places of Scripture compared together, that the Apoſtles themſelves did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute or practiſe Epiſcopall Government, nor commit and derive it to particular perſons as their ſubſtitutes or ſucceſſors therein. We ſhall in further diſcharge of our duty to, and for, the more cleere and full ſatisfaction of your Majeſty in this point, briefely declare into what Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers hands, the ordinary and ſtanding offices of the Church were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and derived by, and from the Apoſtles. The Apoſtles had no Succeſſors in <hi>eundem gradum:</hi> The Apoſtolicall office was not derived by ſucceſſion, being inſtituted by Chriſt, by extraordinary and ſpeciall commiſſion; but for the ordinary and ſtanding uſe and ſervice of the Church, there were ordained only two orders of offices, <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhops and Deacons, which the Apoſtle expreſſeth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>To all the Saints in Chriſt Jeſus which are at Phillipi, with the Biſhops and Deacons;</hi> And only of them doth the Apoſtle give the due characters of Officers: I <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. 8: From both which places of Scripture we conclude with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116882:6"/>
ancient Expoſitors both Greeke and Latine, that Biſhops are the ſame with Presbiters, and beſides Presbiters, there is no mention of any other Order, but that of Deacons; of both which Orders there were in the Apoſtles times, in one City more then one, as in <hi>Philippi</hi> and <hi>Epheſus.</hi> And we humbly offer to your Majeſty as obſervable; That though one order might be ſuperiour to another order, yet in the ſame order of Officers, there was not any one ſuperiour to others of the ſame order; No Apoſtle was above an Apoſtle, no Evangeliſt above an Evangeliſt, no Presbiter above a Presbiter, no Deacon above a Deacon: And ſo we conclude this part, that ſince Church Officers are inſtituted and ſet in the Church by God, or Chriſt Jeſus; And that Ordination by or in which the Office is conveyed is of no other Officers but of Presbyters and Deacons; therefore there are no other orders of ordinary and ſtanding Officers in the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As for the ages immediately ſucceeding the Apoſtles, we anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Our faith reacheth no further then the holy Scriptures; no humane teſtimony can beget any more then an humane faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We anſwer, that it is agreed upon by learned men, as well ſuch as contend for Epiſcopacy as others; that the times immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſucceeding the Apoſtles, are very darke in reſpect of the Hiſtory of the Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the moſt unqueſtionable record of thoſe times, gives cleare teſtimony to our aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Epiſtle of <hi>Clement</hi> to the Corinthians, who reciting the Order of Church Officers, expreſly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to two Biſhops, and Deacons; And they whom in one place he call'd Biſhops, he alwaies afterwards nameth Presbyters. The Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> pretend indeed to the next Antiquity, but are by ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as wholly ſpurious, and proved by <hi>Videlius</hi> to be ſo mixed, that it is hard if not impoſſible to know what parts of them are genuine. Beſides Biſhop <hi>

            <p>Fourthly, We grant that not long after the Apoſtles times, Biſhops in ſome ſuperiority to Presbiters, are by the writers of thoſe times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be in the Church, but they were ſet up not as a Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but as an Eccleſiaſticall, (as afterwards both Arch-Biſhops and Patriarkes were,) which is cleare by Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> his Epiſtle to Sir
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116882:6"/>
               <hi>Francis Knowles,</hi> wherein he ſhewes out of Biſhop <hi>Jewell,</hi> that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Chryſoſtome, Jerome, Auguſtine,</hi> and many more holy Fathers, together with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> agree that by the word of God there is no difference between a Presbyter and a Biſhop; And that <hi>Medina</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> affirmes not only the ſame Fathers but alſo another <hi>Jerome; Theodoret, Primatius, Sedulius,</hi> and <hi>Theophilact,</hi> to be of the ſame judgement: and that with them agreed <hi>Occumini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Anſelme</hi> Arch-Biſhop of Canturbury, and another <hi>Anſelme; Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> and <hi>Gratian,</hi> and after them many others; that it was inrol'd in the Canon Law for ſound and catholique doctrine, and publiquely taught by learned men, and adds, that all who have laboured in the reformation of the Church for theſe five hundred yeeres, have taught that all Paſtors, be they inſtituted Biſhops or Prieſts, have equall authority and power by Gods word. The ſame way goes <hi>Lumbard</hi> Maſter of the ſentences, and Father of the Schoole-men, who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Presbyters and Deacons, ſaith the Primitive Churches had thoſe Orders only; and that we have the Apoſtles precept for them alone; with him agree many of the moſt eminent of that kinde, and generally all the Cannoniſts; to theſe we may adde <hi>Sextus Senenſis,</hi> who teſtifies for himſelfe and many others, and <hi>Caſſander</hi> who was called by one of the Germane Emperours, as one of ſingular ability and integrity, to informe him and reſolve his conſcience in queſtions of that nature, who ſaits it is agreed among all in the Apoſtles times, there was no difference betwixt a Biſhop and a Presbiter.</p>
            <p>For a concluſion we adde, that the doctrine which we have here in propounded to your Majeſty concerning the identity of the Order of Biſhops and Presbiters, is no other then the Doctrine publiſhed by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, 1543. For all his Subjects to receive, ſeen and allowed by the Lords both Spirituall and Temporall, with the nether Houſe of Parliament: of theſe two Orders only (ſo ſaith his Booke) that is to ſay, Prieſts and Deacons, the Scripture ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth expreſſe mention, and how they were confer'd of by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles by prayer, and impoſition of their hands; by all which it ſeems evident that the order of Epiſcopacie, as diſtinct from Presbiters, is but an Eccleſiaſticall Inſtitution, and therefore not unalterable.</p>
            <p>Laſtly we anſwer, that that Epiſcopall Government which at firſt obtained in the Church did really and ſubſtantially differ from Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall Government, which the Honourable Houſes of Parliament
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116882:7"/>
deſire the abolition of. The Biſhop of theſe times was one preſiding in, and joyning with the Presbytry of his Church ruling with them, and not without them, either created and made by the Presbiters chuſing out one among themſelves, as in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or choſen by the Church, and confirmed by three or more of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of like dignity within the ſame precinct. Leſſer Townes and Villages had and might have had Biſhops in them as well as populous and eminent Cities, untill the Councell of <hi>Sardis</hi> decreed that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and ſmall Cities ſhould have no Biſhops, leaſt the name and authority of a Biſhop might thereby come into contempt; but of one claiming as his due and right to himſelfe alone, as a Superiour order or degree, all power about Ordination of Presbiters and Deacons, and all jurisdictions either to exerciſe himſelfe, or deligate to whom he will of the Laity or Clergy, as they diſtinguiſh according to the judgement and practice of theſe in our times; we reade not till the latter and corrupter ages of the Church.</p>
            <p>By all which it appeares, that the preſent Hierarchy, (the aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof is deſired by the Honourable Houſes may accordingly be aboliſhed;) and yet poſſibly the Biſhops of theſe Primitive times might be, they are ſo far differing one from another.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to that part of your Majeſties Paper, wherein you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether our Saviour and his Apoſtles did ſo leave the Church at liberty, as they might totally alter or change the Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at their pleaſure; we humbly conceive, that there are ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials belonging to Church-government, ſuch are appointed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which are not in the Churches liberty to alter at pleaſure: But as for Arch-Biſhops &amp;c. we hope it will appeare unto your Majeſties conſcience, that they are none of the Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours appointed by our Saviour and his Apoſtles; we beſeech your Majeſty, rather to looke to the originall of them then Succeſſion.</p>
