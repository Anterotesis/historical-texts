            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſte to ſet forthe by it ſelfe, what maner of ſtate it is, wherin an Heretike lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his life.</p>
            <p>Secondarily, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of foundation it is, that Frithe bildeth his wycked purpoſe vpon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, how falſelie he dothe vnderſtande, not onlie the holy ſcripture, but alſo the olde holie Fathers, and auncient Doctours of the Catholike churche.</p>
            <p>Fourthly how crafty, falſe, and fooliſhe, his reaſons, and argumentes are to be founde, yf they be well and truely tried.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, what is to be ſayd againſt his opinion, that one body cannot be in two places at once.</p>
            <p>Sixtlie, that the poſſibilite therof, maie be proued by very good reaſon.</p>
            <p>Ye ſhall vnderſtand, that of this diuiſion, the firſt and ſeconde parte, I haue perfourmed and put foorthe all ready, although but rudely and not in all poynctes euen as I wolde, if my haſt to the reſt, had not ben the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But yet ſufficiently, and euen more then enoughe, to ſhowe the due prouſe of ſo much as I thereby did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende. And now therefore, here dothe folowe the thirde
<pb facs="tcp:12768:3"/>
parte, for which, I diſpatched my handes with the more quicker ſpeede of the other two paſte. And that not with out cauſe. For in thys conſiſteth the very chiefe pithe of my principall purpoſe in all the reſte. Which is to make his falſe vnderſtandinge of the olde holye Doctours and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> trew meanynges playnly to appere. And therefore I wiſhe, all thoſe in eſpeciall, whiche hath mooſt nede therof, to loke well, and wiſely vpon it. And therin to haue no reſpecte vnto me, nor yet to any payne or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour beſtowed of my parte in that behalfe. But to haue good reſpecte only to the trewth, which is and may cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be founde therin. Whereof I dare ſay, they ſhall not miſſe, if they be of ſuche good wyll, as without whyche, they cannot be ſaued. For if good will, be to vs in all thinges ſo neceſſari, that we can nothing do rightly with out it, how muche more neceſſary is it to be had, aboute the trial of trewth, in ſo weighty and worthy a matter, as is the very reall preſence of the bleſſed body of our Sauiour Chriſt in the holy Sacrament? For to euen by the trewth, of a moſt weighty, &amp; worthy thing, there is alwaies required a moſte pure, and parfit good will. Whiche is neuer mixed with pride, nor vayne glory, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer infected with diſdayne, nor enuy, neuer yoked with ſtout ſtubbernes, nor obſtinacie, but euer indewed with meekeneſſe and humilite, wyth dew feare of God and charite, with patience and pitie of mannes weaknes and infirmite, for onely to men of that ſorte were, theſe moſte gratious and mercifull promyſes made. <q>
                  <hi>Petite et dabitur vobis, quaerite &amp; inuenietis, pulſate &amp; aperietur vobis.</hi>
               </q> That is to ſay. <q>Aſke, and to you it ſhall be geuen, ſeeke, and ye ſhal finde,
<pb facs="tcp:12768:3"/>
knocke and it ſhalbe opened vnto you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And therfore what is more precious, and more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to be had, then the trewth of this holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? wherfore, let him take hede whiche hathe it not. For when ſhall he haue it, yf he wyll not ſo muche as aſke it? when ſhall he fynde it, if he wyll not voucheſafe to ſeeke it? or when ſhall he enter into it, if he wyll not knocke to be let in? The doore is not to be opened, but onely to them that wyll knocke. The thynge is not to be founde, but onely of them that wyll ſeeke. Neyther is it to be graunted, but onely to theym that will aſke. And who doeth aſke for it? who doeth ſeeke after it? or who doeth knocke, to enter into it? In verie deede, none rightlie, none wyſely, nor anie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, but onely thoſe, that be of good wyll. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onelie to them (as I ſayde) thoſe promyſes were made. And therefore it is not enoughe, to reade, to talke, or to reaſon, and queſtion of the matter. But it is muche more to be wayed and conſidered, wyth what maner of wyll, and intente, all that is done. For trueth is a Lady, alwaies of that ſtraingenes, that ſhe wyl not voucheſaufe to ſhowe her amiable face, but onelie to them that be of good will. For yf any other by chaunce fortune ſometyme to ſee her, (ſpecially there, where they haue no luſt or deſyre to meete with her) indeede vnto them, for all her bewtifull countenaunce, ſhe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth but a lowrynge looke, wyth ſmale occaſion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie credence. And no maruell whye, for thoſe be they, of whome the Scripture doth ſay.<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>They ſee and ſee not, They here and here not.</p>
            <p>And that is not all for lacke of knowledge, but in very
<pb facs="tcp:12768:4"/>
deede for lacke of good will. For as the common ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge is.</p>
            <q>Who is ſo blinde as he, that will not ſee.</q>
            <p>Therfore good will (Gentle reders) good wyll is it, whiche dothe bothe aſke and obteyne, ſeeke and fynde, knocke and is harde, and ſo let in. For without that, moſt trew it is, that nothing can ſpeede in thys kynde of thynges. Wherfore this matter, is to be weyed, and pondered therafter. For who dothe not knowe, that readers there be of dyuerſe and ſundry ſortes.</p>
            <p>Wherof ſome wyll ſone conceiue myſlykinge, if they fynde but the matter any thinge longe in readinge, and ſay, it is to tedious. How be it in very deede thoſe be they, of whome men may ſay.</p>
            <p>They are ſone wery of well doninge.</p>
            <p>Some other therbe whiche in reading, falleth ſtrayte into miſlikyng, if they fynde any thinge paſſe their vnder ſtandinge, ſaying it is very darke and to obſcure. And all becauſe, they loue not in ſuch good labour, any while to tarry or longe indure. But of that, they do fyrſte, they will make the laſt, and ſo giue it ouer.</p>
            <p>Some, yf they finde not the matter, ſette out wyth paynted ſpeeche accordinge to theyr pleaſure, ſtreyght, they wyll ſay it is verie groſe, and but rudely dunne, without witte or learninge, and ſo make that an excuſe of theyr miſlikinge.</p>
            <p>Some will miſlike the matter, becauſe of the wryter. And ſome the writer, becauſe of the matter.</p>
            <p>And ſome not eche for other, but euen indifferently bothe together. But what eſtemers, or louers of trewth ſhall we recken all theſe, which wyll thynke it to derelie
<pb facs="tcp:12768:4"/>
bought, with bearing the light burden of a litle tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? or to paynfully gotten, with the labouring awaye of a litle obſcuritee, and darkenes? or to be the leſſe worthy good acception, for lacke of ſome fyne and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious expreſſion? or to be regarded after the writer.</p>
            <p>And not, as it ought to be, euen after the matter? what eſtemers (I ſaye) or louers of trewth ſhall we recken theſe? how vnworthy of trewth be they, whiche wyll other refuſe it, or ſet the leſſe by it, for theſe cauſes or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other lyke? ſpecially in ſo great a matter, as thys holy Sacrament is? Wherfore thys muche haue I ſayde, for a louinge warnynge, and a frindly monition, only to them, whiche hath neede therof. Truſtinge, that when this, that foloweth ſhall come to their redynge, they wyll not forget this neceſſary warninge, but well and wiſely will beare it in mynde, and vſe them ſelues accordingly. For otherwiſe, reade they may, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit they can not. And therfore now good Chriſten rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, becauſe no man is, or can be herein, ſufficient of hym ſelfe, but as the holy Apoſtle dothe ſay.</p>

                  <p>I will recite vnto thee ſome of his owne ſaiyng, and by that, thou maieſt perceiue how I know it. For in the 30 leafe of his booke, he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, or feinyng, that he hath his purpoſe proued by S. Auſten, doth ſay theſe woordes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This were proofe enough (ſaith he) to conclude, that all the olde fathers did hold the ſame opinion. For who wold once ſurmiſe (ſeyng we haue S. Auſten ſo plaine for vs, which is the chiefeſt amonge them al, who wold once ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (I ſay) that he diſſented in this great matter, from the other faithfull fathers, or they from him? Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, I dare not let him ſtande poſt alone, leaſt ye diſpiſe him. And therfore I will ſhew you the mynde of certeine other alſo. And alſo of his maiſter Saint Ambroſe. &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe woordes of his, it appereth playne, and much worthy to be noted, that he doth not only brynge the olde holy fathers to confyrme his vnderſtandynge of Saint Auſten, but alſo that, (to fortifie the ſame) he would haue no man, ſo much as once ſurmiſe, that S. Auſten in this great matter, diſſented from other the faithful fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers,
<pb facs="tcp:12768:10"/>
nor they from him, as I graunt al that to be trew in deede. But what a ſurmiſe is this of him, that (as he ſaith) he dare not let Saint Auſten ſtande poſt alone, leſt we wold deſpiſe him, if he ſhoulde not bringe forth the minde of the other faithfull fathers to defende him? where tooke he any occaſion thus to ſurmiſe, but only of his owne arrogant fooliſhe head, to make ignorant perſons beleue, that this holy man S. Auſten maketh clerely for him in his wicked purpoſe? as in the .29. leafe of his booke, he boſteth in plaine words, which are theſe, <q>Bleſſed be god (ſaith he) which hath ſo cleerely diſcuſſed this matter by this faithfull father.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, leſt thou woldeſt ſay or thynke, that this ſame arrogant ſurmiſe of his, proceded not, but (as many a man doth ſome tyme ſpeake) raſhly by chaunce, here him in the .24. leafe of his booke, where he hath theſe woordes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Now were this enough (ſaith he) for a chriſten man that loued no contencion. But becauſe there are ſo many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters in the worlde, which care not what they ſay, ſo they holde not theyr peace, I muſte needes ſet ſome bulwarke by this holie doctour, to helpe to defende him. For els they will ſhortly ouer runne him (as they do me) and make him an heretyke to. Therfore I will allege his maiſter Saint Ambroſe. &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>How ſaiſt thou now? who can declare his malicious and arrogant blindneſſe, ſo fully as he declareth it him ſelfe? for what a malicious blindneſſe, is this of him, thus to ſurmiſe any nede to defende Saint Auſten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, as thoughe we would not allowe him? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when it may here, of his owne woordes appere, that he bringeth not in, the reſt of all thoſe faithfull fathers, for any neede he hath of them, but to defende Saynt

Auſten, whom he ſayth, is proufe enough for his purpoſe becauſe he diſſenteth not from them, nor they from hym, it muſt needes folow, that if Frithe be founde falſe in his vnderſtandynge of Saynt Auſten, he ſhalbe therin founde falſe in his vnderſtanding of them all, and of the ſcripture to, when they do al agree (as he doth confeſſe) and herin diſſent not one from another.

                     <q>In euery text (he ſaythe) is but only one verite, for which it was ſpoken.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And alſo agayne, in the .18. leafe he hath theſe wordes.
<q>Some textes of Scripture (he ſayth) are only to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande after the letter, and ſome textes are only to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande ſpiritually, or in the way of an allegory. And, ſome muſt be vnderſtande both litterally and ſpiritually.</q>

                  <p>I ſay this, that Frithe doth herin but reporte Saynt Auſten thys to ſaye. And dothe not alledge where, nor yet perchance recite Saint Auſtens owne wordes, in ſuch order and forme, as he dothe ſpeake them him ſelfe nother. Wherfore Frith is herein to be rather miſtruſted, then beleeued. And beſyde that, theſe words which he hym ſelfe doth here reporte of Saynt Auſten, dothe leaue this text (This is my body) ſo muche at large, as to be vnderſtande litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie, as well as figuratiuely. And doth not dryue it to this narrow ſtreyght of only figuratiuely, as Frithe wolde wraſte and wringe it vnto: for figuratyuely, and only figuratiuely, doth very muche differ. Becauſe, with the one, there may ſtande an other, but with the other, no more but it ſelfe alone. It is two thinges to ſay, that our Sauiour chriſt is a man, and to ſay that he is only a man. For the one is ſayd trewly, and the other is a dam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nable hereſy. Wherefore as he that ſayth Chriſte is
<pb facs="tcp:12768:12"/>
to be vnderſtande a very man, and yet taketh him not therin to be only a man, nor denieth him to be very god. Euen ſo S. Auſten whiche doth ſay, that this text, This is my body, is to be vnderſtande figuratiuely, dothe not therin ſay or meane it to be vnderſtande only figuraty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely. Nor denieth it to be vnderſtande litterally. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe a thinge be trewly ſayde to be ſo or ſo. Yet that draweth not with it this conſequence to be only ſo. But Frith dothe reaſon the matter after this ſorte, as if he ſhould heere a man reported, to be learned in Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, he will ſtreyght conclude, that the man can no ſkyll of Phiſike nor Geometry, but only of Aſtronomy. When for al that report, he may be, as diuerſe ar, lerned: ſome in two, and ſome in all three. Therfore of this kinde of concluſions, I hope thou ſeeſt enoughe. Wherefore, how can Saynt Auſten (whome Frithe hym ſelfe, doth here report, to ſay none otherwiſe of this texte (This is my boddy) but that it is to be vnderſtande figuratiuely, make any thinge for him, in this that he ſayth it is to be vnderſtande only figuratiuely and not litterally? when the wordes reported of Saint Auſten maketh no farther mention, but of the one, and not of the other. And yet, without putting any difference betwene fyguratyuely, and only figuratiuely, or bringing for hym any dew alle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gation of Saynt Auſtens owne words where, or in what order he ſpake them him ſelfe, the blinde arrogant foole is not here a ſhamed to boſte and ſay, that he hath herein Saynt Auſten, wholy of his ſide.

                  <p>Well, this graunted, what is it to the purpoſe of the very preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſtes bleſſed body in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? for that is it, whiche he goeth about, with all he can to diſproue? will it folow that Chriſtes bleſſed body is not really and verely in the Sacrament, becauſe the Sacrament in reſpect of it ſelf, is not his natural body? The queſtion lieth vpon in, or not in. And Frith conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon is, or is not. As if I ſaye, my booke is in the Churche, he will proue the contrary by thys, that the Church, is not my booke. Therfore becauſe the churche is not my booke, is it not thereby well proued thinkeſt thou, that my booke is not in the Churche? becauſe we
<pb facs="tcp:12768:16"/>
ſay, as the trewth is, that the very body of chriſt is in the ſacrament, he wil proue the contrary by this, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament is not his very body. Plucke out of his booke, all thoſe concluſions, that he of this forte, and truſt me trewlie, thou ſhalt therin leaue but few or none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde.

For well knew he, that the moſte parte, are farre from the knowledge and conſideration of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and difference, that is betwene the Sacrament and the thinge of the Sacrament. Whereof the olde holy Fathers dothe ſay.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And therfore becauſe the one ſomtime beareth the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes of bothe, that is to ſay, the name of it ſelfe as it is, and alſo the name of the other, not as it ſelfe is, but as it is called, for good cauſe why, he thought, that as the Sacrament is called Chriſtes body, and yet is not hys very bodie indeede, ſo he thought as thou ſaydeſt before, that his body is ſayd to be therin, and yet is not verelye therin indeede. Wherfore as he thought the trew proufe of the one, ſhoulde be enough to colour hys falſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

proufe of the other, ſo with the trewth of the ſame one, he wolde take away, not only the trewth of the other but alſo our verie profit of them bothe together.

But of thys am I ſure, that his folowers ſeeth it not, for if they dyd, they wolde not all, (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) do as they do.

For a ſtone hath

but a bare being without any life at all, where as a vine hath ſo muche, and a vegetable life alſo.

                  <p>How was it otherwiſe poſſible for hym this to ſay, but by that meane? And yet that, not withoute the holye permyſſion of Goddes inſcrutable prouidence, to the great and wonderfull ſhame of all thoſe, that foloweth this curſed kaytyues opinion.

and therby ſo infortunat, as to be the folowers of ſuche a dampnable lyinge leader. And yet in this, their ineuitable ſhame, is offred vnto them (if they wyl take it) a wonderfull occaſion of obteynyng the great mercie of God agayne. For what greater occaſion of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto trewth againe, can they haue or imagin, then this theyr notable ſhame of folowing him, whoſe moſte dampnable error is ſo great, and alſo manifeſt, that they them ſelfes are not able to defende, nor excuſe it? It is none excuſe that ſome of them dothe make, ſayinge that Frithe might ſo ſay in ſome reſpect. For in what reſpect may anie man thynke, but dampnablie, that Chriſt is a very ſtone? Who ſo euer thinketh him a very ſtone, can therin thinke him no better thinge. For a very ſtone, of him that ſo taketh it; can be thought no better then a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſtone, of what ſorte or kinde ſo euer it be. Therfore, Frithe being found the authour of ſuch a doctrine, what neede we anie farther trial of him, other in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, or in the holy doctours other, when we haue ſuche a proufe of him, as this, his moſte curſed ſaying is, that it is not dampnable to thinke that Chriſt is a very ſtone or a vyne? who wolde truſt him in anie thinge els.

And the other ſo ſpeciall, that it maketh relation to ſome certen ſtone, mentioned before or after? And therefore it is not all one to ſay. The ſtone was Chriſte and to ſay, A ſtone was Chriſt. For in ſignification (The) and (A) dothe here muche differ. Wherfore Frith dothe falſely Engliſhe the litterall ſenſe (whiche is) the ſtone was Chriſte, with this that he ſayth, a ſtone was Chriſt.<note place="margin">1. cor. 10</note> For the one maketh playne relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ſpirituall ſtone expreſſelie mencioned of the Apoſtle him ſelf immediatly before, &amp; ſo doth not the other.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this it may well appere, that falſely doth Frithe bring in, theſe two textes, of the ſtone, and the vine, to be one phraſe of ſpeache, without any difference.

                  <p>Ye but that I denye. For without queſtion they dyd eate that, which they were byd to eate, whereof, it was to them ſayde, Take eate, This is my body, whiche ſhalbe geuen for you. And that was not breade, except thou wilt ſay, that bread was geuen for their redempcion. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where he ſaith, that this woorde bread, is taken after the letter, And therof would haue it folow, that this ſentence, This is my body muſte be figuratiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken, I aſke him why figuratiuely, more then lytterally, or why fyguratiuelie, and not rather litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally? For if the woorde of eatynge, he taken after the letter, dooth it not thereof muche better folowe that the woordes of that whiche is eaten, ſhulde be taken after the latter likewiſe? To take the woord of eatynge, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſence and therfore the woordes of the thyng eaten, is a figuratiue ſence is more ſtrange then I can ſkil of.

For there, the letter maketh no mention of any ſimilitude or ſacrament other. Wherfore if S. Auſten had mente by this that he ſayeth, after a certayne maner, none other but that Chriſte bore the ſimilitude of hym ſelfe, in hys owne handes, when he ſayd, This is my body, he myght ſone haue founde, how that might haue bene as wel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanded in Dauid, as in Chriſt. Therfore it was not that, whiche he ment, when he ſayd, he founde not howe it might be vnderſtand in Dauid after the letter. For Dauyd might haue borne the ſimilitude of hym ſelfe in hys owns handes. Wherfore thys that Saynt Auſten ſayeth, Chriſte bare hym ſelfe in hys owne handes, after a certayne maner, can be no expoſition (as Frithe wolde haue it to be) of thys that he ſayeth, Chryſte bore hym ſelfe in hys owne handes after the letter.

                  <p>Trew it is. How be it no ſuche, but that they maie and dooe ſtande together well enoughe. For after the letter, is here ſayde, in reſpect of the very reall and eſſenciall beyng of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce.

                  <p>Ye but when he bore him ſelfe in his owne handes (as Sainte Auſten ſaith) after a certaine maner, there was no ſuch ſtrange forme appeerynge then.</p>

                  <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes euen ſo ſtrange, as when he by the way ſhewed him ſelfe to the two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. For then he ſhewed him ſelfe in the forme of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche fourme coulde not be ſtraunge, but wel known,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12768:28"/>
in that reſpect, what it was. Therfore the ſtraungnes was not in that, but in this, that he ſhewed him ſelfe in the fourme of an other maner of man, whiche was no man in deede, but he him ſelfe ſo in it, as though he had not beene therein. And therfore the fourme is ſayde to be ſtrainge, becauſe it was of him ſo ſtranig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed. Wherefore lykewyſe, when he bore hym ſelfe in his owne handes after a certayne maner, he bore him ſelfe in the fourme of bread, whiche fourme, to anie man coulde not bee ſtraunge, but well knowen what it was. Therfore the ſtraing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was not in that, but it was in this, that he bare him ſelfe in the fourme of breadde, whiche was no breadde in deede, but he him ſelfe ſo in the fourme thereof, as thoughe he had not beene therein. And therefore the fourme, maie alſo there, be ſayde to bee ſtraynge becauſe it was, as dayly it is, of him ſo ſtraingely vſed. Wherefore as he, to the two diſciples, ſhowed him ſelfe after a certayne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that is to ſaie, not in his owne proper fourme, but in the fourme of an other maner of manne, whyche made him therein ſo ſtraynge vnto theim then, ſo he bore him ſelfe in his owne handes after a certayne maner, that is to ſaie, not in his owne proper fourme, but in the fourme of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maner of thynge, whiche maketh him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo ſtraynge now vnto them, that bee vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For as Saynt Auſten ſaieth of it in manie places, <hi>Norunt fideles,</hi> The faythfull knowth him therein well enoughe, he is not ſtraynge therein
<pb facs="tcp:12768:29"/>
to them. For he that can vſe him ſelfe vnder one fourme, more then is proper or naturall vnto him, And that without the crafte, arte, or helpe of man, I doubte not, but that he can vſe him ſelfe vnder, an other and mo formes, or vnder as many as he will. As it may well appeere by that he ſhowed him ſelfe, as is aforeſaid to the two diſciples in the fourme of a trauailer by the waie.<note place="margin">Luc. 24 Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 20 Mat. 17.</note> And to Mary magdalen in the fourme of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner. Alſo an other tyme, to three of his diſciples, in the fourme of a glorified bodye. Wherefore he dyd none of theſe, after a common maner, but after a certain maner. Yet this ſame certaine maner, neither dooth, nor yet can take away, the very reall and ſubſtanciall preſence of the vſare thereof, or haue any beyng it ſelfe, where the vſare thereof is not, or force anye good and trew vnderſtandynge, that the vſare of it ſhoulde not euen be there, with it or in it. For it doothe but onelye ſhowe how dyuerſly, he can behaue him ſelfe in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence, and denieth not therein his preſence. By this therfore it maie well appere (as I ſaide before) that this ſaiynge (After a certaine maner) and this ſaiyng (after the letter) maie well agree, and ſtande both together.</p>
                  <p>As good reaſon, and thexample thereof whiche I haue recited vnto thee of the holy goſpell, dooth plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. For the trewth to ſay, (as the trewth is in deede) thoſe two ſaiynges of Saynt Auſten are not ſpoken, but in theſe diuers reſpectes. The one (as I ſayde) in reſpect of the very ſubſtanciall beynge of the thynge it ſelfe, whereof it is ſpoken. And the other, in reſpecte of the Accidentall fact or behauiour of the ſame. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when S. Auſten ſaith, Chriſte bore him ſelfe in his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12768:29"/>
owne handes after the letter, the very vnderſtandynge therof apperteyneth onely to the reall and ſubſtanciall preſence of Chriſtes very body in the ſacramente, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge touching any accidentall qualitees or occult be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour thereof, but the verite of the ſubſtaunce onely. And when he ſaith, Chriſte bore him ſelfe in his owne handes after a certayne maner, the trewe meanynge of that apperteineth only to the very ſecret and inſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible behauiour of it in the ſacrament, and not to the ſubſtance wherin that inuiſible behauiour is. And beſide this, how farre from all doubte of this vnderſtandyng, doth Saint Auſten expreſſe the matter him ſelfe, in his woordes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged? where he ſaith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Chriſte was borne in his owne handes, when he ſettynge foorth the ſame his owne body. fayth, This is my body. For he bore that body in his owne handes.</q>

                  <p>The ſame his owne body (ſaith Saint Auſten) or the ſelfe ſame body of his, chooſe the whether. For ſo theſe woordes, <hi>Ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum corpus ſuum,</hi> maie or muſt needes be Engliſhed, and no way els more trewly. Wherefore thoſe woordes of Saint Auſten can not be applyed, to any ſigne, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, or ſacrament other, but directly to the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the thing that he ſpeaketh of, which is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed body of Chriſt. And that ſpecially when he addeth vnto it, and ſaith, he bore that body in his owne handes. He ſaith not a body, as incertaine which, but he ſpeaketh certeinly and ſaith, that body, wherof he dooth playnely treat. And that appeereth alſo in the other place, where he ſaith.</p>
                  <p>He bore him ſelfe after a certaine maner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:12768:30"/>For what ſo euer that maner of bearyng was, yet him ſelfe, can be none other but him ſelfe. Saint Auſten ſaith, he bore him ſelfe. And there is nother ſigne, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, or ſacrament of him, that is, or can be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, to be him ſelfe. For this worde, him ſelfe, or it ſelfe, hath none other reſpect, but alway and only, to the very reall and ſubſtanciall being of him or it, wherof it is directly ſpoken. Wherfore this that S. Auſten ſaith. <q>Chriſte bore him ſelfe in his own handes after the letter. Serueth onely to conuince them, that denieth the very real preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſts bleſſed body in the holy ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</q> And this that he ſaith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>He bore him ſelfe after a certaine maner.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Serueth onely to helpe and amende the blindeneſſe of them, that conſidereth none other but onely ſuche com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon maner of bearyng and beyng, as their owne out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde deceiuable ſences, dayly dremeth vpon, whereby they are drawne to ſuch wonder at the matter, that they thinke it to ſtrainge, to beleue therin, as the holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke churche dothe teache. And all becauſe this bearyng that S. Auſten ſpeaketh of, is not common, but after an other certaine maner, then their blinde phantaſtical dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of ſenſible thinges, can, may, or is able, to reach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And therefore therin to holde and kepe them ſtyll, Frith doth labour and trauayle with his wringyng and wreſting of this ſame certaine maner, to ſuch an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as nother the wordꝭ of S. Auſten, nor yet any reaſon, authoritee, or learning, can beare or ſuffer. For he, thorow lacke of puttinge any difference betwene the thing done, and the maner of the doing, doth ſo confound them together, that with his handlyng of the one, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12768:30"/>
him ſelfe and many mo, in the trewth of them bothe. But ſuch was his lacke, not onely of learninge, but muche more of grace. For it is two thinges to teach what was done, whereof S. Auſten ſaith,</p>
                  <p>Chriſt bore him ſelfe in his owne handes after the letter.</p>
                  <p>And to teach how or after what maner it was doone, wherof S. Auſten ſaith no farther, but that it was done after a certaine maner, of which certaine maner, here he declareth no farther, becauſe (as he doth trewly ſay) the veritee of the thyng, the faythfull doth know. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe he declareth here no farther thereof, Frith of his owne head, taketh vpon him to do it him ſelfe, after his hereticall maner. Whom if we coulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, we might thynk our ſauiour Chriſte no better then a very ſtone, without (as he ſayth) any parell of damnacion at all. Wherefore if thou haſte mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked well, what I haue hitherto ſayd, thou maiſt eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue how fooliſhe and falſe his vnderſtandyng of Saynt Auſten is.</p>

                  <p>Why, who can take them otherwiſe, the wordes beinge ſo playne? for doth he not ſay in the one place,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Chriſt hath geuen vs the ſame fleſhe to eate, wherein he walked here in earthe.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>And what is this, but eate and not eate one thinge both at once, whiche is not poſſible? for other that body which they ſaw, was the body of that fleſhe, whiche (as Saynt Auſten ſayeth) was geuen vs to eate, and that fleſhe was the fleſhe of that body whiche they ſaw, and ſhould not eate it, or els that body was of an other fleſhe and that fleſhe of an other body, and then the one or the other, not Chriſtes body or Chriſtes fleſhe, which were (I ſuppoſe) euen curſednes to thinke. For wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of is his owne body, but of his owne fleſhe? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is his owne fleſhe, but of his owne body? And therfore where he ſayth the ſame fleſhe, he might haue ſayd the ſame body. And where he ſayth this body that you ſee, he might haue ſaid, this fleſh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you ſe, &amp; al one.

one reſpecte. And yet the very ſame then, that it is now, and the very ſame now that it was then, in an other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte.

                     <q>Ye ſhall not eate this body that ye ſee.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ye ſhal not eate it in ſuch ſorte, as ye ſee it, but as it ſhal be in a ſacrament, wherin ye ſhall not ſee it. For els, if he had not ſo ment, he woulde not haue ſayde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Except ye eate the fleſhe of the ſonne of man, and drynke his blood ye ſhall not haue life in you.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For he ment not that fleſhe to be eaten in that proper viſible fourme whiche they ſaw, and yet to be eaten, in deede for all that, or els he woulde not haue denied lyfe (as he dothe) for the not eating of it. And therfore eaten it muſt needes be of very neceſſitee. Althoughe not that, as it was of them ſeene, but yet that, as it ſhuld be of them and vs both, trewly and verily beleued, in the holy ſacrament. And for that cauſe he ſaieth, I haue ſette forth vnto you a certayne ſacrament, and beyng ſpiritually vnderſtande (that is to ſay, farther and farre otherwyſe then your ſences can reache) it geueth you lyfe. Wherefore becauſe here appeereth both eatyng and not eatyng of one thynge both at once, whiche are bothe trew, And that can not be in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, it muſt therfore nedes folow to be vnderſtand and taken, as the trewth is, in two reſpectes. Wherof the one, that is to ſay, the eatyng, is in reſpect of the verye thinge, with the inuiſible ſtate, occult and ſecrete beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour thereof, as it is in the holy ſacrament. And the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is to ſay the not eatyng, is not but in reſpect of the viſible fourme, and ſencible apparence thereof to their eyes. And therfore this eating and not eatinge be not here ſo direct contraries, as thou takeſt them for.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>Chriſte ſaid, doth this offend you? what will ye ſay then, when ye ſhall ſee the ſonne of man aſcendynge thither, where he was before? Then addeth S.

And Chriſte addeth, it is the ſpiryte that quickneth, The fleſſhe profyteth nothynge. The woordes that I ſpake, are ſprite and lyfe. That is to ſay, (ſaith Sainte Auſten) are ſpiritually to bee vnderſtande.

                  <p>And what is that, but if ye eate if, it ſhall not profite you? is it not all one? Therefore is there any thynge more agaynſt Chriſtes ſaiynge then that? when Chriſte ſaieth,</p>

                  <p>They be not ſo contrary as ye take them. For all Chriſtes meaninge
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12768:37"/>
(as it apereth by his owne woords) is of ſpirituall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng by feyth, and not of carnall eating with the teth. And that doth Frith defend and nothynge els, as it ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the .44. lefe of his boke where his wordꝭ be theſe.
<q>
                        <p>If Chriſte had (ſayth he) ſo ment, that his owne bodie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſhould haue continued in the ſacrament, whiche is the meate of the ſoule thorow feyth, and not of the body by eatynge of it, and maie as well be eaten thorow feyth, although it remayne in heauen, as if it were here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our mouthes, if he had (I ſaie) ſo ment, then wold he neuer haue geuen vs ſuche ſcriptures as he did. for I ſay that this groſſe imaginacion may not ſtande with the proceſſe of the ſcripture, whiche is receiued, as it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere by certeine textes. Firſt where our ſauiour ſaith, The fleſſhe profiteth nothyng. The waight of thoſe words doth compell vs to vnderſtande our matter ſpiritually.</p>
                        <p>For by this ſhorte ſentence, we are no leſſe plucked backe from the carnall eatyng, then was Nichodemus, that he ſhould not once dreame of the carnall regeneracion, when Chriſte ſaide vnto him. That what ſo euer was of the fleſhe, was fleſhe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And alſo againe, in the .47. leafe, Frith hath accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the ſame euen theſe woordes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is impoſſible (ſaith he) the ſcriptures ſtandyng as they dooe) that the naturall body of Chriſte, ſhoulde be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente to our teeth in the ſacramente. And as for our faith it neadeth not to haue hym preſent in the bread. For I maie as well eate him and drynke him thorow faith. That is to ſay, beleue in him, as though he were as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the ſacrament, as he was hangynge on the Croſſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this ye ſee, Fryth dothe expreſſe his mynde ſo playnly that no man can doubt of his meanynge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Whiche in effect reſteth but in two pointes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one is. That chriſtes very bodie fleſhe and blood hath no verie beeynge nor reall preſence in the
<pb facs="tcp:12768:38"/>
ſacrament. And the other is, that what ſo euer Chriſte ſpake as towchynge the eatynge therof, muſt nedes be vnderſtande, onely ſpirituall. And theſe two hath he proued by the woordes of Chriſte, and alſo by S. Auſten to.</p>

But thou haſt herde profe enough to the contrary, if that wolde ſerue. And therfore what ſo euer he hath brought for his profe hytherto, hath other made directly agaynſt him, or els vtterly nothynge for him.

                  <p>Yes ſyr, for he hath proued, that it muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande ſpiritually.

And therefore, where there maie be no carnall vnderſtandynge, there can be no fleſſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynynge. Wherefore thus hath Fryth his purpoſe thorowly, that is to ſay, that the fleſhe profiteth not to be eaten, and that, by reaſon of the ſpirituall vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, wherof he is moſt aſſured, both by chriſts woordes (as I ſayde) and Saynt Auſtens alſo.</p>

Chriſte anſwerynge ſayd, <q>Dothe this offende you, that I ſayde, I geue you my fleſſhe to eate, and my bloodde to drynke? This offendeth you in deede. Therefore what if ye ſee the ſonne of man aſcendynge thyther where he was before? What is this? By this he eaſed ſome, whom he knew. By this he opened wherwith they were offended. Wherwith vtterly, if they woulde haue vnderſtande it. For they thought him to deuyde and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12768:39"/>
diſtribute his body. But he ſayde, he wolde aſcende into heauen euen whole. When ye ſhall ſee the ſonne of man aſcendinge where he was before, ye ſhall certaynlie ſee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then, that he diſtributeth not his body, in that maner that you thinke.

                  <p>That is falſe. For their faute was not therin, but it was in their miſvnderſtanding of the maner of it, as here Saynt Auſten in playne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des doeth well declare, they thought him to deuyde, and diſtribute his body peece mele. And that miſvnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, doeth Chriſtes queſtion touche directly, ſayinge. <q>What yf ye ſee the ſonne of man, aſcendynge where he was before?</q>

                  <p>So that their faute (for whiche they are here reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
<pb facs="tcp:12768:40"/>
was for that they gaue no farther credence to Chriſt, in the maner of geuyng his fleſhe to eate, then theyr owne imagination, and blinde vnderſtandinge did leade them vnto. And not for that, they thought hys meanynge to be of hys owne very fleſhe in deede. For whiche thinking of his owne very fleſhe, they bare here, no ſmake of any blame at all, as they ſhould haue done, if it had bene a faute ſo to thinke. Wherefore, this thou mayſt ſee, how very nothinge, this place maketh for Frithe, notwithſtandinge all the great truſt that he had therin.</p>

And for what pupoſe are we that we are, but that we might haue euerlaſting life, whiche thou haſt promyſed with thy fleſh Therfore what is, it profiteth nothing, the fleſhe profiteth nothinge, but as they vnderſtode it? for they vnderſtode fleſhe ſo, as it is rent, or torne in a dead carkas, or as it is ſoulde in the ſhambles, and not as it is quickened with the ſpirite. Therfore ſo it is ſayde, the fleſhe profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge, as it is ſayde ſcience puffeth vp. Now therfore ought we to hate ſcience? God forbyd. And what is, ſcience puffeth vp: alone without charitee. Therfore he ioyneth to it. But yet charitee doeth edifie.

Albe it, it dothe muche profit to be ſlayne for our redemption, and eaten thorough fayth. Whiche thinge we may do, althoughe his naturall fleſhe be not in the Sacrament. For I may as wel beleue in hym, thoughe he be in heauen, as if he were in earthe, and in the Sacrament, and before myne eyes. And that Chriſte ſpake theſe wordes of his owne body, it is playne, by Saynt Auſtens wordes, writing vpon the ſame place. And therefore he ſayeth, that they muſt be vnderſtande ſpyrytually, and addeth, if thou vnderſtande them ſpyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually they are ſpirite and life.

                  <p>Well ſyr, it is to late for him, to dooe that nowe. And therefore ſith ye holde it ſo neceſſary to be done, I pray you for the fruictful furderance of our talke herein, declare you whether the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it be onely mere ſpirituall or not, and what the ſpirituall vnderſtandyng of it is.</p>

                  <p>Then thou muſt firſt conſider this, that although ſome, yet all and euery ſpirituall vnderſtandynge, doth not exclude, and forbyd the vnderſtandynge of all maner of fleſſhe, as it doth, when it is but onely and mere ſpirituall, as ſome tyme it is, and ſome tyme not. For if thou take ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnderſtandynge ſo, that is to ſaie, to be alway of one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and mere ſpirituall thinges, thou ſhalt not take anie body or fleſhe, within the compas of any ſpirituall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandynge at all. Wherefore if thou take it ſo, that there may be no ſpirituall vnderſtandyng of any fleſhe, thou takeſt it then, euen directly againſt the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint Paule, wrytynge to the Corinthians of the generall reſurrection, and deſcribinge the difference of the ſtate of the body before and after. where he ſaythe, <q>It is ſowne a naturall body,<note place="margin">1. cor. 15</note> and it ſhall ryſe a ſpirituall

body. There is a naturall body. And there is a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all body.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And a little after he ſaith alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That is not firſt, whiche is ſpirituall, but that, whiche is naturall. And then that whiche is ſpirituall.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here thou maieſt ſee by the holy apoſtle (if thou truſt him) that ſome bodye is, and mo ſhalbe, ſpirituall at length. And a ſpirituall body can not be, trewly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, but at the leaſt in ſome reſpect ſpyrytu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Except thou wilt ſay, it maie be otherwyſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande then it is, which is no perfyte good, and trew, vnderſtandyng in dede. Therefore, this doth not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as Frith wolde haue it, that where is a ſpirituall vnderſtandynge, there is no fleſhe. But this doothe well folowe, that where there is ſpirituall fleſhe, there the vnderſtandynge muſt needes be ſpirituall, not therin deniyng the veritee of the fleſhe, but declaring the ſtate and condicion therof. Yet this ſpirituall vnderſtanding, is not al onely and mere ſpirituall, becauſe it is not dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and only of a ſpirite, but of a certaine perfite and very fleſhe, whiche is ſpirituall, and not a ſpirite, but ſpirituall, for that it is aduaunced ſo nere the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirite, whereunto it is knit, and therby made ſpirituall, as of the contrarie parte, the minde of ſome man is made carnall and fleſhly, not becauſe it is fleſhe-but becauſe it is ſo addict vnto the fleſhe, that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſubiect vnto the vitious deſires or inclinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And therfore called (as it is in dede) fleſhely. For of ſuch a man, we ſaie, he is a man of a fleſhly mynde, yet his minde is not fleſhe for all that. Wherfore as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of that man is fleſhly and no fleſhe, ſo is the fleſhe of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12768:44"/>
the other, ſpirituall and no ſpirite. And for that it is ſpirituall, it muſt be ſpiritually vnderſtande. And that can it not trewly be without the ſpirite, by whiche it is made ſpirituall. And therfore the woordes whiche are ſpoken of that fleſhe, are called ſpyrite and lyfe, that is to ſay, ſpiritually to be vnderſtande. For without that ſpyryte the fleſhe profyteth nothyng. Wherwith, they were trewly anſwered, whiche toke it otherwyſe, that is to ſay, without the ſpyryte. As it apereth by the words of Saint Auſten recited before.</p>

For what meaneth he by this, that we ought not to vnderſtande the fleſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſhe, but that we ought to vnderſtande it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome other thing, whiche is here ment by the fleſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and not the fleſhe it ſelfe?</p>

haue thought the ſo fooliſhe, as to take it ſo. for this as is though it were all one to ſaie, we ought not to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande the fleſhe after the fleſhe, and to ſaie, we ought not therein to vnderſtande any fleſhe at all, when the ſaiyng forbyddeth vs not, the vnderſtanding of the fleſhe it ſelfe, but the vnderſtandynge of it, after the common courſe, and naturall diſpoſicion thereof. It forbyddeth vs to vnderſtande it, as nature here daiely doth vſe it, and at length ſhall leſe it, but not as the ſpirite ſhall at length againe obteine it. The ſpirite of man it ſelfe, is nowe in this lyfe muche after the fleſhe here, but the fleſhe in the next lyfe, ſhalbe after the ſpirite there. After the fleſhe here, hath no place, nor being there. And that ought we to conſider here. For the fleſhe is one thinge, and after the fleſhe is an other. Wherfore although in the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they go here both together, yet in this matter, our vnderſtandinge muſt plucke them a ſonder, or els, thou ſhalte vnderſtande fleſhe, after the fleſhe, whiche is death, as thou haſt harde before, and more playnely doth appere, by the manifeſt woordes of thapoſtle againe, in an other place, where he ſaith.</p>

                  <p>That is after Frithes learning. For his wit was ſo yoked with the commen courſe of nature, that his vnderſtandinge coulde reache no farther. And yet in his tyme I dare ſay he herde of this difference of thinges, that ſome were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and ſome ſupernaturall. Wherfore, I deny not, but that the bleſſed body and very fleſhe of our Sauyour Chriſte, was once naturall, but not ſynce the tyme of hys reſurrection. For what is naturall, but what ſo euer is vnder the yoke and lawes of nature, as our bodies
<pb facs="tcp:12768:48"/>
are, and our fleſh is? And what thinges may we call ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall if that be not one of them, whiche hath bene once naturall, and now hath ouercome the power and ſtrength of nature, and hath gotten cleane out of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and bondage therof? wherefore, yf thou ſay, that there is no ſuche thinge, then thou muſt needs graunte, that the body, and fleſh of our Sauiour Chriſt hath euen now, neede of eyer and brethe, meate, drinke, ſlepe and ſuche other, as without whiche, no naturall body of man doeth,<note place="margin">Ex. 34.3. re. 19.</note> or can be able, to lyue and indure. Except it be by myracle for a ſeaſon, as in parte, it was wyth Moyſes and Helyas by the ſpace of .40. dayes. Therefore if the body of Chriſt haue now, neede of thoſe thinges, then it is paſſible, and may ſuffer. If it be paſſible and may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, then it is mortall, and may dye. And that I am ſuer thou wilt not graunt. Wherfore if it can not dye, it is not mortall, if it be not mortall, it can not ſuffer. If it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer, it hath no neede of thoſe thinges, or any other like. If it hathe no neede of any of thoſe thinges, what hathe nature to do with it, when thoſe be thynges, which of neceſſite nature requereth? Therfore if nature haue nothing to do with it, how can it be natural? That, is not naturall, whiche the courſe of nature hath nothinge to do with all. Therfore why doth Frithe ſo often call it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but becauſe his vnderſtanding of it, was ſo carnal that he coulde ſee no ſparke of the ſtate of it, whiche is ſpiritual? He did not know, that natural and carnal, are no meete, nor conuenient termes, to be put to the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the holy fleſhe of Chryſte, as they are not indede If a man ſhould go to the very proper ſignification of the wordes. Becauſe therein they make no difference
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12768:48"/>
betwene the ſtate of that fleſhe and ours. For ours is naturall and carnall. And therefore to the declaring of hys fleſh, there ſhould be put in the place of naturall, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural. And in the place of carnal, ſpiritual, as now the verites of the thinge, doth moſt worthyly and dewly require. For if it were alway vſed to be ſpoken of ſo, it wolde perchance eaſe ſome weake myndes, of many car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall and fleſhly phantaſies, that runneth yet in their hed des aboute this matter, as there did none other in Fri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thes hedde, ſo longe as he lyued. For as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth in dyuerſe places of hys booke, he tooke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be one of hys pryncipall groundes, to proue his purpoſe by, in thys caſe. And therfore he that wyll go aboute to improue and diſalowe that by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whiche is ſupernaturall, ſhall proue hym ſelfe (I may ſaye to thee) euen as Frythe did, farre worſe then a naturall foole. Wherefore herein leaue thy dreamynge of what ſo euer is naturall and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and tourne it to that, whyche is ſpirituall and ſupernaturall an other whyle. Or els thou ſhall neuer haue, trew, perfit, and conſtante faythe in this matter, whyle thou lyueſt. For ſo longe as thy cogytation herein, runneth or reſteth vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of naturall fleſhe, thou ſhalt neuer be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied, wyth any trewth, that thou ſhalt gette and come by that waye. Therefore remember and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the holy Apoſtle in that he ſayeth (as I tolde thee before.)</p>

                  <p>That is not ſo. For the feelynge of payne, doth not euen properly belonge and apperteyne vnto lyfe, but vnto death. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the ſelynge of pleaſure, doth not belonge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, but vnto lyfe. It is proper to death, to come by paine. And proper to life, to acquere pleaſure. for the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge, which perfect and very lyfe hath, is of none other but of pleaſure. And the feling that very death hath, is of none other, but of paine. But this is ſumwhat ſtrainge, becauſe in this world, there is none of them both. That is to ſaie, nother perfect life, nor yet (if I may ſo call it) perfect death nother. For the lyfe that we haue here now is but as it were a courſe vnto deth, or a mixture of both together. wherein death in concluſion preuaileth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an ende of both. that is to ſaie, of life and it ſelfe to. For they both be here tranſitorie and temporall, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde, permanent and eternall, not mixed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together, or the one folowynge the other, as they do here.

                  <p>Thou that takeſt one thynge for an other. For did I ſaie that they ſhall remaine deade? when I ſayd none otherwyſe but that they ſhall remaine in death. Ded and in death, are two thinges. For he that is dead, is paſt death &amp; without all

maner of felyng. But ſo is not he, that is in death. For he is but at the poynt of dyinge, which abydynge ſo, is farre worſe, then dead in deede. For he feleth ſumwhat but what is that? In dede no pleaſure, but onely paine and that extreme. Wherfore that, or ſo much as we ſee of this matter, by dayly experience here, geueth to vs good occaſion of ſome conſideracion, how it ſhalbe there. For although it be finiſhed here in a ſhort time, yet it ſhalbe there continuall for euer. Wherefore, ſay not, that thoſe whiche ſhall remaine in perpetuall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion and miſerie, ſhalbe therefore immortall.

And therfore as thoſe maie, and be trewly called immortall, ſo the other might, if the woorde were in vſe, be called inuitall.</p>
                  <p>For thoſe two woordes geueth this muche to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, that, as the one ſort, nother doth nor can die.</p>
                  <p>So the other, nother doth nor properly can lyue. For they be contraries.</p>

                  <p>Then that death can not greue them, if they haue no lyfe. For (as I ſayd) without lyfe they can not fele.</p>

                  <p>That is not ſo. For what is feelynge, but the ſenſibilitee of well or wo? That is to ſaie, of pleaſure or payne, And therfore whereto tendeth, or belongeth the ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litee of payne, but vnto death, as I tolde the before?

God forbyd. If they haue not the ſenſibilitee of pleaſure, they haue not that, whiche apperteyneth and belongeth properly vnto lyfe. If they haue not that whiche apperteyneth and belongeth vnto lyfe, how can we trewly ſaie, that they dooe lyue or haue lyfe?</p>

                  <p>why ſyr, lyfe is one thynge, and pleaſure is an other, and payne is a thyrde.

                  <p>For how ſhould we trewly iudge lyfe in thoſe, which we know, it were better for them, that they had neuer bene borne: as of one of them in eſpeciall, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell doth ſay.</p>

                  <p>Ye but the ſcripture doth not ſo call it, becauſe it maie, but becauſe it is ſo. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how canſt thou trewly call them immortall, when they are in a death eternall? they might rather be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mortall, then immortall. How be it properly none of them both. For mortall is that. whiche ſhall haue a fynall death. And immortall is that, whiche ſhall haue none at all, but a perpetuall and a pleaſant life. for neuer die, is onely in heuen. And euer die, is only in hel, Wherfore ſith euer die, and neuer die, be two direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, this woorde immortall can neuer be trewly nor properly ſayd of them bothe: for it doth exclude and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forbyd the vnderſtandyng of all death, which hath in hell, no leſſe then a perpetuall continuance for euer.</p>
                  <p>Therfore ſith it maie thus appere, that although thoſe damned bodies ſhall haue their beyng eternall, and yet are not in deede immortall, becauſe they ſhall remaine in the ſecond death which is perpetuall, it muſt nedes folow, that there is no ſuche impediment as thou doſt obiect againſt the going together of impaſſibilitee and immortalitee, but that they maie, as they are, and muſt nedes be, alway inſeperable. Wherefore although by this occaſion, thou haſte cauſed me ſomewhat to dygreſſe from my purpoſe, yet to returne therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to agayne, I ſay as I ſayde, that as paſſibilitee and corruptibilitee doth apperteyne and belonge to the ſtate of mortalitee, ſo doth ther contraries, that is to ſay, impaſſibilitee and incorruptibilitee appertayne and belonge to the ſtate of immortalitee. And for

a generall rule, there is nothynge that is or maie be ſo vnderſtande of Chriſtes fleſhe, and his bodie nowe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, as it is and maie be now of other mennes fleſhe and their bodies, or might haue bene of his, when it was mortall.</p>

For yf it were his glorious pleaſure to ſtande here now betwene vs bothe, thynkeſt thou that we ſhoulde ſee theſe thinges in hym, as in like caſe, we ſhoulde ſee them in other, and aſke them no leaue? or that his very beyng betwene vs, ſhould let thy ſeyng of me, or my ſeynge of thee, as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans direct being betwene vs ſhould do, whether we or he wolde or not, except it were his holy pleaſure ſo to do?

                  <q>He that eateth my fleſhe and drinketh my bloud, bydeth in me and I in hym.</q>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem, etiamſi tantae rei Sacramentum, ad iuditium ſibi manducat &amp; bibit.</q>

                     <q>He that eateth my fleſhe and drynketh my bloud, abideth in me, and I in him. This is therfore the eatinge of that

meate, and drinikng of that blood, to abyde in chriſte, and to haue him abydynge in vs. And therfore he that abideth not in Chriſte, and in whom Chriſte abideth not, without doubt he eateth not his fleſhe nor drynketh his blood, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he eate and drinke the ſacramente of ſo great a thynge vnto his damnacion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And vpon this, Fryth him ſelfe hath theſe woordes.
<q>This one place (ſaith he) is ſufficient to proue my purpoſe though he ſaide not one woord more. For here he dooth plainely determyne, that he which abideth not in Chriſte, That is to ſaie, he that is wicked or vnfaithfull, doth not eate his fleaſhe nor drynke his blood, although he eate and drynke the ſacrament of ſo great a thynge.

                  <p>Doth not the firſt place ſay (as Frith hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) that, to eate Chriſtes fleſhe, and drynke his blood, is to abide in him, and he in vs? and by that, he that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydeth not in Chriſte, nor Chriſte in him, eateth not his fleſh nor drinketh his blood, although he eate and drinke the ſacrament thereof. Now this beinge plaine enough, yet to confirme the ſame, doth not the ſeconde place ſay alſo, let not him ſay or thynke, that he eateth my body or drynke my blood, which abideth not in me, and in whom I abyde not? Therfore they abyde not in Chriſte, which are none of his membres. And they are none of his membres, which maketh them ſelues the membres of an harlot. And yet cleere it is, that ſuch wicked perſons, doth often times eate and drynke the ſacrament. Wherfore, if other the ſacrament it ſelfe, were Chryſtes verie body and blood, or his very body and blood were verely in it, it ſhulde and wolde nedes folow, that ſuche wicked lyuers and vnfaythfull perſons, as neuer abyde in Chriſte, nor he in them, whiche dooe daiely eate the ſacrament, ſhoulde therin eate his very bodye, and drynke his blood. And that doth Saint Auſten in bothe places vtterly deny.</p>

                  <p>I graunt it to be both plainely ſpoken, and alſo trewly. But yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plainely nor trewly nother, as Frith doth take it.</p>
                  <p>For he taketh it not to be ſpoken, but of the very reall eatynge of it, whiche in deede is vtterly falſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt that, whiche I tolde the, of Saint Auſtens own ſaiynge before. where he ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Chriſte for our health, hath geuen vs the ſame fleſhe to eate, wherin he walked here in earth, and the ſame fleſhe, that he tooke of the virgin Mary.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And where did he (as I ſaid before) geue vs that fleſhe to eate, but in the holy ſacrament? And therefore who ſo euer dooth eate the ſacrament, muſt nedes alſo ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, eate that fleſhe, or els that ſaiynge of Saint Auſten can not be trew. Wherefore this is directlye againſte Frithes vnderſtandyng of theſe two later places: which thou haſte recited. Whereby we maie well perceiue, that Saint Auſten ment not in them, as Frith doth take him. For if he did, he ſhoulde be in this one place, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agaynſt him ſelfe in the other two places. Whiche in ſo weighty a matter, god forbyd to be thought of S. Auſten: whoſe moſte excellent witte, learning and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hath reigned and floriſhed ſo longe in ſuche an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable eſtimacion, as it hath moſt worthely done. For herein, if he had ſo ment as Frith doth take him, then in him there ſhould haue bene verified this notable ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge of the Apoſtle.</p>

                  <p>Which were enough to deface all his doyng herein, and him ſelfe to. Wherfore it can not be auoyded, but this is enough, whereby thou maieſt be ſure, that frith dooth falſely vnderſtande theſe two places of Saint Auſtens, as he doth all the reſt before.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12768:62"/>
or not, will it not, nor maie it not, be rightlie anſwered and ſayde, that he eateth nothynge? When he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not that therein, whiche eatynge is chieflie or onely ordeyned for? In ſo muche that if one will ſaye, he dooth eate, wyll not an other ſay, what eatynge call ye that, whiche dooth more hurte then good? ye rather no good at all, but muche hurt, when the eater is neuer the better for it, but the worſe: For is that eatynge worthy, or meete to be called eatynge, which is not onely without all the commoditee and profite of eating, but alſo doth purchaſe far more hurte and hinderaunce, then not eatynge. Therefore althoughe in reſpecte of the thynge eaten the ſycke man dooth eate the verie ſame meate, whiche the hole manne dooth eate, yet becauſe he dooth not eate it, with that inwarde effecte and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte of it, that the hole man dooth eate it with all, it maie well be ſayde and ſtande with reaſon, that he eateth not, becauſe that whiche he dooth, is but in vayne. For althoughe eatynge bee commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and vnderſtande of the meate and outwarde maner of receyuynge thereof, yet it maie as well and better be vnderſtande of the verie inwarde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modytee and profyte thereof, for whiche profyte on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the outwarde eatynge is prepared and ordeyned, as it is plaine, when without, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the other doth nothing (as I ſayd) but greatly hurt and hinder, although the faute and cauſe therof, be not in the meat taken, but onely in the ſtate of the taker. Wherfore, if a man wolde ſaie, (as ryght well he might) that the ſicke man eateth
<pb facs="tcp:12768:63"/>
not, meaninge in reſpect of the commoditee and profite, that eatynge is ordeyned for, yet of that faiynge it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, but that he dooth eate of the verie ſame meate, that the hole man dooth eate, for all that.</p>
                  <p>For the name of eatynge dooth include the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, not only of the outwarde maner of eatynge, but alſo and moſt cheefly, of the inward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditee and fruict<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full profite therof, which is the very dew ende, wherunto the other is not ordeined but only to ſerue. And therfore of eating, that ſame dew ende, doth moſt worthely beare the name, as it doth ſomtime, and euen ſpecially now in this caſe, where it is, of no more mente, but euen of that alone. So that betwene theſe two reſpectes, that is to ſaie, of the outwarde eatynge, without profite, and of the inwarde eating, wherin conſiſteth all the profite therof, there is both eating and not eating of one thing, and that both at once. The one by it ſelfe alone, euyll and hurtfull: and the other, good and effectuall. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore likewiſe in our caſe, of this effectuall eatynge it is, that Saint Auſten dooth here ſpeake of. For doth he not in theſe two foreſayde places, ſpeake onely of theſe eaters. which abyde not in Chriſte, nor Chriſte in them?</p>

                  <p>Although it be harde to tell the why, for thynſuffitie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of our engliſhe tongue yet for the beſt declaration therof, that I can make, thou ſhalt vnderſtande, that for this latyn worde <hi>Corpus,</hi> we haue this englyſhe worde, bodye. And for this latyn worde <hi>Corporale</hi> (which commeth of <hi>Corpus</hi>) becauſe we haue no proper Engliſhe worde for that, we borrow therof this worde corporall, whiche geueth any thynge to be vnderſtande, partayninge to a body, according to the order of nature, as accidentall qualites doeth. And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more lykewyſe, for this latyn worde <hi>Caro,</hi> we
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12768:64"/>
haue thys Engliſhe worde, fleſh. But for this latin worde <hi>carnale</hi> (whiche commeth of <hi>caro</hi>) becauſe we haue no Engliſhe worde for that nother, ſo proper as is able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen aptly and fully to counteruayle the ſignification therof, we therfore borrow of it, this worde carnall, as we do of <hi>corporale,</hi> corporall. Which wordes, both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and carnall, althoughe they be no Engliſhe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des properlie, yet by vſe, they are growne into ſuche ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quayntaunce wyth many, (although not learned in the latin tongue) that they know, or haue a great geſſe, what they meane and ſignifie. And that in thys caſe, is what ſo euer (as I ſayd) partayneth to a body or fleſhe naturally. Whiche ſome doeth Engliſhe wyth theſe wordes, bodylie and fleſhlie, althoughe thoſe be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Engliſhe wordes, not of <hi>corporale</hi> and <hi>carnale,</hi> but of <hi>corporaliter</hi> and <hi>carnaliter.</hi> whyche doeth ſome what differ from <hi>corporale</hi> and <hi>carnale.</hi> Therefore when we eate the bleſſed body of chriſt in the holy ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, we may no more ſay, that we eate it corporally or bodyly (and yet eate it verily). Then, when we eate therein (as we do in deede) hys verie fleſhe, we maye ſay therof, that we eate it carnallie or fleſhly. For ſo we eate it, as we ought to vnderſtand it. And we ought not to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it carnally, nor fleſhly. For if we do, then we vnderſtand it after the fleſh, which the doctrine of the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie apoſtle dothe vtterly forbid, as I haue declared vnto thee al redy. And therefore as the fleſhe, and after the fleſhe, is two thinges. So the body, and after the bodie is to thinges likewiſe. And as the vnderſtandinge of the fleſhe after the fleſhe, is none other but to vnderſtande it carnallye or fleſhelie, So the vnderſtanding of the
<pb facs="tcp:12768:65"/>
body after the body, is none other, but to vnderſtande it corporally or bodyly. Wherfore, as it is proued bothe by Saynt Auſten and alſo by Saynt Paule before, that we may not vnderſtande Chriſtes holy fleſhe after the fleſh, that is to ſay, not carnally nor fleſhly, ſo we may not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande his bleſſed body, after the body nother, that is to ſay, not corporally nor bodyly. For after one rule, they muſt be vnderſtande bothe of them, whiche rule the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie apoſtle doeth geue vs, where he ſaythe (as before is alledged.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. cor. 5,</note>
                     <q>Although we haue knowne chryſte after the fleſhe, yet we do not ſo now.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therfore if we may not know Chriſte now, after the fleſhe, we may not now, vnderſtand him after the fleſh. For we can not knowe him one way, and vnderſtande him an other way. Therefore if we may not vnderſtand him after the fleſhe, then we may not vnderſtande hym after the body. For that is fleſhe. Wherfore as it is none other to vnderſtande him after the fleſhe, but to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande him carnally or fleſhly, ſo it is none other (as I ſayde before) to vnderſtande him after the body, but to vnderſtand him corporally or bodely. And for that cauſe, as we are by the apoſtle, forbyd the vnderſtandinge of him after the one, ſo we are likewiſe in the ſame, forbyd the vnderſtanding of him after the other. And therefore, how woldeſt thou haue me graunte a corporall eatinge of Chriſtes body, or to be eaten corporally, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may not vnderſtande it corporally? for we may not eate it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one ſorte, and vnderſtande it after an other, leaſt we make a diſcrepance or a variete in the thinge, whiche in the verite of it ſelfe, is none other in our eatinge, then
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12768:65"/>
in our vnderſtandinge, nor in our vnderſtandinge, then in our eatinge of it, but all one. For although a body can not be by nature corporally or bodyly, except it be very<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, yet, by poſſibilite, it may be verely, althoughe it be not corporally or bodely, but as Chriſtes body in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament is. For verely, riſeth of the ſubſtaunce. And corporally or bodely riſeth of the naturall qualites ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto annexed. Whiche in hys bleſſed body are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally chaynged. And therefore it is ſufficient for vs to beleue, that (as the trewth is) we eate his body in the Sacrament verely, althoughe we eate it not corporally or bodylie. That is to ſay, not after a corporall or a bodylie maner, becauſe to be eaten of vs, it nether doeth nor yet needeth, to behaue it ſelfe after that ſorte.</p>

corporall, by reaſon of a ſupernartual connection of that ſubſtance, and ſuche ſupernaturall quantitee and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litees together, as are beyonde al therperience and reche of any mortall mans wit, reaſon, or vnderſtandyng, I holde ſo well with that to, that I will here none of you all, what ſo euer ye wolde feyne or ſay to the contrarie.

                  <p>If they do not ſo mean, why do they put thoſe wordes naturall and corporall to it, whiche dooth none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſygnifie: and not rather forbyd them to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when the ſignificacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, is to their meaning ſo contrary?</p>

                  <p>I ſhall tell the why. Fyrſte, becauſe there be no proper woordes for the thinges that they meane by them, except they ſhould call naturall ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and corporall ſupercorporall. Wherof allthough ſupernaturall, hath ſome vſe monge them that be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet is it farre, both from the vſe and alſo the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandynge of them, that be vnlearned. But as for this woorde ſupercorporall, playne it is, that that was neuer in vſe among the vnlearned, nor yet among the learned nother, becauſe there is not founde any ſuche
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12768:68"/>
woord of that compoſicion.</p>

                  <speaker>HERE.</speaker>
                  <p>Then were they beſt, to bringe both thoſe woordes into an vſe, whereby they might expreſſe directly what they meane, and not there, to vſe thoſe other woordes, whiche dooth ſignify the contrary or inſufficientlie.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
                  <p>No not ſo. for where they put this woord naturall, if they ſhoulde put ſupernaturall, and where they put corporall, if they ſhoulde put ſupercorporall, althoughe moſte of ſuch as be learned, coulde well awaie with all, yet the greate multitude of the vnlearned, ſhould by that, be rather prouoked to the miſtruſt and doubt of the verytee of the thynge, then to the fyrme credence and faſt beleefe therof, if ſuche ſtraynge woordes, were ioyned vnto it, as they for lacke of knowledge were not able to vnderſtande, nor coulde awaie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. For thoſe words ſupernaturall and ſupercorporall, coulde not be brought amonge them into ſuch a familiar vſe, as might leade them any nere the vnderſtandynge or beleeuynge of the veritee of the thyng, then the other words doth, nor ſo nere nother, they beyng vnlearned as they are. Wherfore it were without wiſdome, all reaſon, and diſcreacion, to ioygne ſuche woordes vnto that (whiche of neceſſitee they ought to beleue) as might rather brynge them in dout, and the thynge out of credence, then to confyrme them in their faith as the trewth thereof doth require.

ſignifie the ſtate or maner of the thinge, but moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly to confirme and ratifie the veritee therof.

                  <p>Wherefore beſide all this, if theſe woordes naturall and corporall, were in this caſe put cleane away, and not vſed of good and catholyke men, to be ioyned vnto it, as they are are, how lyke is it, that ſome of you, wolde ſone reyſe vp againe, this olde very peſtilent hereſye of the Manicheis, whiche ſaid that Chriſte had but a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall bodie, and no very body in deede.

And therfore one of the chiefe cauſes why catholike me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do vſe to put thoſe words vnto it, is to preuent, &amp; ſuppreſſe that curſed hereſie, from riſynge any more agayne. And an other cauſe is (as I ſaide before) to confyrme and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhe the faith of the multitude, in the veritee of the thinge, And not to declare therby the maner of beynge and qualitees therof (whiche farre paſſeth our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) nor to ſhow any ſuche naturalitee or corporalite, to be in it, as we haue in our bodies, ſubiect to the order and courſe of nature, by reaſon wherof, we are now

when he doeth euen there make mencion of Chriſtes fleſhe? wherefore therin, thou ſayeſt not well, For he ſpeaketh it bothe of Chriſte, for ſo muche as partayneth to the newnes of him in fleſhe, and alſo of them, that trewlie folow him, for ſo muche as pertayneth to the newneſſe of them in ſpirit. That is to ſay, in ſpirite now, and in fleſhe then, when they ſhal riſe agayne and be made all new, not only in ſpirit, but alſo in fleſhe, Where as now they are all new, not in fleſhe but onelie in ſpirit. And therfore the minde of the apoſtle is there, to declare, that as Chriſte is now all new in fleſhe, for ſo muche as partaineth to the mortal and corruptible ſtate of the quantite and qualites thereof, ſo muſt thoſe that trewly folow him, be now all new in ſpirite, that they might here after at the latter day, be likewiſe all new in fleſhe, as he is now.</p>
                  <p>

Cap. 3.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherfore if thou ſay that Chriſtes holy fleſh, hath in it now, ſuche quantite, as it had before his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Thou ſayeſt none other therin, but that it is olde. And therefore if thou ſay that it is olde, then thou denieſt it playne to be new. And if thou denie it to be new, then thou arte therin directly agaynſt the holy Apoſtle, whiche doeth partelie therof ſay, as before is alledged. <q>The olde thinges are gone and paſt, beholde all are made new.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore what thinges are made new in Chriſtes fleſhe, but the corruptible quantite and qualites therof?
<pb facs="tcp:12768:72"/>
for when he ſayeth.</p>
                  <q>Althoughe we haue knowne chriſt after the fleſhe, yet we do not ſo now.</q>
                  <p>He doeth not therein denie him to haue fleſhe, but to be knowen after the fleſhe. Therefore what other thinge is it, not to know him after the fleſhe, but not to knowe him after the former courſe and olde ſtate of the fleſhe, as it was before his reſurrection, whyche is now alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, chaynged, and made new, farre after an other ſorte. And therefore when the quantite and qualites of hys bleſſed fleſhe, in the time of the paſſibilite, and morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite thereof, were for all that, euen then obedient and ſubiecte vnto hys holy will, farre beyonde and contrarie to the common courſe of nature, as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto thee before, And when they are (farther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more) euen now in the tyme of hys glorification, made new, and chaynged ſo farre into ſuche an other ſtate, as paſſeth the vnderſtandinge of any mortall mannes witte, why dremyſt thou (not wythſtandynge all thys) vpon anie ſuche naturalite and corporalite to be in it, as is in ours, or was in hys, before his reſurrection, when (the verye trewth to ſay) that ſame naturalite, is now turned into ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalite, and that corporalite, into ſupercorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, yf I might ſo call it?

By reaſon wherof, Frithe had in them ſome hope, where as in this, he had none at all. For he percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge this place to ſpeake preciſely, and expreſſely of one eating that is ſpeciall, (whiche geueth an other to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that is general) thought, that if he ſhould make his allegation thereof, it wolde geue an occaſion, of a great interruption of all his purpoſe. And therefore he toke the other two places, (which (as he thought) ſemed to deny the very eatinge that is generall) to ſerue hys turne farre better then this, whiche doeth expreſſe the ſpeciall. Wherin he clerely deceyued him ſelf, as it may well appere by this, that Saynt Auſten doeth euen here, the verie ſame that he doeth there, ſpeake onely, (as I ſayde) of one ſorte of eaters in ſpeciall, and not of all ingenerall. Wherfore the ſame eatinge that S. Auſten
<pb facs="tcp:12768:75"/>
doeth meane there, muſt nedes be vnderſtande of thys eatinge, whiche he doeth expreſſe here. For indeede they be all one, as the ſpeciall ſtate and ſorte of the eaters is, of whome he ſpeaketh in all three places.</p>

                     <q>They that abyde not in Chriſte, nor Chriſte in them, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not his fleſhe nor drinketh his blood, although they eate and drynke the ſacrament of ſo great a thynge.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe he expreſſeth not there, euen certainely what maner of eatyng it is that he meaneth (wherefore ſome, are therof in doubt) we may and iuſtly do, way that place by this, where he ſaith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>He that abideth not in Chriſte, and in whom Chriſte aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, without doubt he eateth not his fleſh ſpiritually, nor drinketh his blood.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this place therfore, we waie the other, becauſe he
<pb facs="tcp:12768:76"/>
excludyng all doubt in this, doth plainely expreſſe what maner of eatyng it is, that he doth meane in the other, wherein he dooth but leaue it to men of good wyll to be vnderſtande, who neuer faileth to take it ryght.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when that maner of eatynge, whyche he dooth meane, is made very certaine in the one place and not ſo in the other. That is to ſay, plainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the one place, and not expreſſed in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, why dyd Fryth alledge him in that place, where it is not expreſſed (ſith in that maner of eatynge ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the matter) and wolde not alledge him in the other place, where it is expreſſed, and put cleane out of queſtion? what other why (as I ſayde before) can there be found in his ſo doinge, but onely falſhed? For who wòulde take a mannes tale to witneſſe, where he ſpeaketh but obſcurely or incerteinly, and vtterly refuſe it there, where he ſpeaketh it full, hole, and plainly? a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man els, but onely Frithe, and ſuch as he was? for the plaine place he wilt well, he could nother ouerthrow, nor yet wrynge it to anye apparence of his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But the obſcure and ambiguous place, he thought he might wreſt, whiche waie he liſte, and ſo to make many beleue (as he did in deede) that it ſufficientlye ſerued his turne.</p>

Wherefore, thus maieſt thou ſee, Why Frith alledged that place of Saint Auſten and not this, ſo craftylie as he dyd. Whiche was no more but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12768:76"/>
becauſe, when he ſaw, there was made therein, no ſpeciall mencion by name of the reall eatynge, whiche is moſte common and generall, nor yet of the ſpyrytuall eatynge, whiche is more ſinguler and ſpecyall, but of eatynge ſymplie, without anie dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte or proper diſtinction, he thought he myght vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande of them bothe, whiche he lyſt, or els take it, as thoughe there had bene none other maner of eatynge thereof, but euen verie one alone. And thereuppon he did take that place to be no leſſe, then enoughe, and very ſufficient to proue his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>As I graunt it had beene in deede, if it had beene after that ſorte to be vnderſtande, as he tooke it.</p>
                  <p>But he looked ſo muche vpon this poynte, that he founde there no mencion made of anie dyſtynction of eatynges (whereby he thought he myght take (as I ſayde) whyche he lyſte or one for all) that he forgat, what mencion Saynt Auſten made there, of the diſtynctyon (although not of eatynges, yet for all that) of eaters, whiche was enoughe, to ſhow what maner of eatynge he mente. For as his manifeſt ſpeakynge was there, of a peculiar ſorte of eaters, ſo his very meanynge, muſte needes be vnderſtande of a peculiar maner a eatynge.</p>
                  <p>For it is agaynſt all reaſon and trewthe, to denye that to ſome, whiche is common to all, or to graunte that to all, which perteyneth but to ſome. And therfore, thou maiſt well know, that Saint Auſten wolde not do ſo. For he denyed not there, but onely that eatynge, whiche apperteyneth vnto ſome, and not vnto all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:12768:77"/>That is to ſay, only to them that be good, and not vnto them that he nought. Of whom there, he dooth make mecion, and of none other. For the libertee real of eating perteyneth both to good and bad. But the ſpirituall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng perteyneth to none but onely to them that be good.</p>

                  <p>Now what canſt thou wiſhe more plainely ſpoken, for the reall eatynge and drynkynge of Chriſtes moſt precious fleſhe and blood in the holy ſacramente, then when he ſayth (as here thou ſeeſt) we eate it not onely in the ſacrament? that ſame not onely in the ſacramente, dooth moſte cleerely declare it to be therin euen verely eaten. for he wolde not haue ſaid,
<pb facs="tcp:12768:78"/>
not onely in the ſacrament, but not in the ſacrament. For not in the ſacrament, and not onely in the ſacrament, are two thinges. Not in the ſacrament, denyeth it to bee eaten therein, but not onely in the ſacrament, confeſſeth it to bee eaten therein, and alſo other wiſe to. Wherefore this very reall eatinge of Chriſtes bleſſed fleſh and blood in the holy ſacrament, muſt nedes be common and generall, when (as here S. Auſten ſaith) many doth it, which be nought, whoſe eating therof, thou maieſt well know commeth not to the perticipacion or partaking of the ſpirite that quickneth, when thoſe be they, that abyde not in Chriſte, nor Chriſte in them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the participacion or partakynge of the ſpirite therin, is and muſt needes be, the ſpirituall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, whiche is not generall, but ſpeciall and proper onely to thoſe, that abyde in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them. as the noughty and euill ſorte dooth not. And yet they in the ſacrament (as Saint Auſten doth here plainly ſay) do eate his fleſhe, and that muſt nedes be really, becauſe it is to playne, that it can not be ſpiritually. Wherfore, here thou haſt now of Saint Auſten plainely expreſſed, and diſtinctlie touched, both the very reall eating, which is common to good and had, and alſo the ſpirituall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng, whiche perteyneth to none, but onely to them that be good.</p>

<q>Abraham (he ſaith) did eate his body and drynke his blood thorow faith.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the firſt leafe he ſaith alſo</p>

owne fleſhe and bloud in deede, but only of the fayth and beleuing in him, as it appereth in the .17. lefe of his boke where he ſayth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Who ſo euer dwelleth in Chriſte, (that is to ſay) beleueth that he is ſent of god to ſaue vs from our ſinnes) doeth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie eate and drinke his body and bloud, althoughe he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer receyue the ſacrament.

                  </p>

                     <q>As for, our faythe (he ſayth) it nedeth not to haue him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the breade.

                  <p>What, in ſo many places, and ſo diuerſly, as our Sauiour Chriſte him ſelfe, his holy apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtles, and al the other holy fathers of the Catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che, doeth ſpeake of it, in thoſe playne wordes of eatinge and drinkinge? And when none of them all, doeth ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, nor teache it? as in witneſſe whereof, it dothe in the wordes of S. Auſten, laſt recited before, very clerely appere, if thou remember them well. When therein he ſayeth, that thoſe doeth eate the ſame fleſhe and drinke the ſame bloud, of whome the holy Apoſtle doeth ſaye, they eate it and drinke it, to theyr dampnation. And playne it is that thoſe, whiche eate it and drinke it to theyr dampnation, doeth nother eate it, not drinke it ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually.

<pb facs="tcp:12768:80"/>
But to theyr ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore how ſo euer Fri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the doeth take it, ſithe it is cleare by Saynt Auſten, that thoſe, which doth eate it &amp; drink it to their dampnation, doth eate the ſame fleſh and drinke the ſame bloud, and yet not ſpiritually, it muſt therefore needes folow, that they do eate it &amp; drinke it euen in very deede really. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou wylt ſay, they eate it not at all, whiche were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly agaynſt Saynt Auſten and Saynt Paule bothe.</p>
                  <p>Farthermore, thou ſhalt vnderſtande, that in Saynt Auſtens dayes, there were many, that came and dyd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in the name of Chriſte, whiche were called <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumini,</hi> that is to ſay, herers or learners. And ſo called becauſe they were not baptiſed, for that they beleued not ſome certayn myſteries in ſome of the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. And therfore where the goſpell doeth ſay, that when Chriſt was at Ieruſalem in the tyme of Eaſter, many did beleue in the name of hym, for the myracles they ſaw him do,<note place="margin">Iohn. 2.</note> but Ieſus did not commit hym ſelfe vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Saynt Auſten vpon the ſame place doth ſay, that all thoſe be ſuche, whiche are called <hi>cathecumini,</hi> that is to ſay, herers or learners. For his owne wordes thereof in latin be theſe.</p>

                     <q>Cathecumini are al of the ſame ſort. For they beleue in the name of chriſt. But Ieſus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth not him ſelf vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Let your charite marke and vnderſtande. If we ſhall ſay to the cathecumini, doeſt thou beleue in Chryſte? he wyll anſwer and ſay, I beleue, and bleſſeth him ſelf. Now he beareth the croſſe of Chryſt in hys forehead. And is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of the croſſe of hys lorde. Beholde, he beleueth in hys name.

                  <p>To beleue in Chriſte? is it that thinkeſt thou, whiche Saynt Auſten doeth here meane, that (as he ſayeth) this Cathecuminus doeth not know, when he hym ſelfe ſayth of him, that he beleueth in chriſte? Thou mayſt perceyue it can not be ſo. For yf S. Auſten had ment here none other eatinge and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge of it but that, he wolde not haue noted him to be ignorant of his queſtion, when he him ſelfe reporteth
<pb facs="tcp:12768:81"/>
him to beleue in the name of Chriſte. For that were as muche as he requireth, if he had ment nothinge els.</p>
                  <p>Therfore if thou perceyue it not alredy, let vs looke far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what S. Auſten doeth meane, by hys not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge. Anie thinge els, but his not beleuinge? And what meaneth Saynt Auſten by his not beleuing, but that he beleueth not accordinge to his aſkyng? And what is it to beleue accordinge to his aſkinge, but to beleue the very eatinge and drinkinge of Chriſtes fleſhe and bloud? for that is the verie playne queſtion, whiche he doeth aſke him. Wherfore that muſt needes be the thinge which the Cathecuminus knoweth not. And that becauſe, he be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leueth it not. And therfore it is hys lacke of faithe in the reall eatinge and drinkinge of Chriſtes holy fleſhe and bloud, that Saynt Auſten doeth here finde faute wyth him for. And not for anie other eatinge and drinkinge therof, which as Frithe ſayeth is nothinge els but onely faythe and beleue in Chriſt. Whiche fayth (as Saynt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten ſayeth) this Cathecuminus hath, and yet chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth not him ſelfe vnto hym. Therefore when Saynt Auſten doeth aſke him the queſtion of eatinge and dryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of the fleſhe and bloud of the ſonne of man, it is an other eatinge and drinking that he doeth meane and ſpeake of, then this Cathecuminus doeth knowe or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, or els he wolde not réprehende hym therein as he doeth. It is an other alſo, then Frith doeth beleue, when he ſayeth a man may vſe it, althoughe he neuer receyue the Sacrament. And therfore what other is it, but euen only the very reall eatinge and drinking of it in the holy Sacrament?</p>

                  <p>For the ſpiritual eating, commeth not to paſſe, but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the whole trewth of beleuing. And the hoole trewth of beleuinge, conſiſteth not in holding ſome partes of the fayth, and denyinge ſome other, but in holdinge them whole, euen altogether. Therefore Saynt auſten
<pb facs="tcp:12768:82"/>
doeth here (as in many other places moe) farther mean then he doeth expreſſe. For where he doeth here (as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the fayth) no farther ſay, but beleue, yet he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth theſe wordes, wholy, and trewly, to be vnderſtande with all. For he meaneth no ſuche beleue, as is mixed or corrupted with any falſhed, or with the lacke of any parte of it. Therefore beſyde thys, he meaneth farther then ſo to. For he meaneth not that ſame beleefe nother, althoughe it be neuer ſo whole and trew whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is infected with euyll and wycked maners.

For withoute that maner of beleuynge (whiche is but accordinge to Saynt Auſtens meaninge) doubtles there can be no ſpirituall eatinge at all. And in that maner of bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge, there is and muſt needes be contayned, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye beleefe of the reall eatinge. For the ſpyrytuall eatinge was not ordeyned for the reall eatynge, but the reall eatynge for the ſpirituall eatynge.

                  <p>Nay Saint Paule dooth not ſay, that the one is any more damnable then the other. For he ſpeaketh but of the one alone. And yet therin, his ſaiynge dooth not make it damnable nother. For it dooth but declare it ſo to bee And therefore I aſke of the, why the other ſhoulde not be ſo to? For if I be vnworthy to eate it, I am (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion) vnwoorthy to looke vpon it. For bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the acte of eatynge, and the acte of lookynge or behouldynge, doubtleſſe there is no difference, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny woorthyneſſe or vnwoorthyneſſe, more in the one, then in the other. Wherefore, if there be none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, why it is damnable to eate it vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyly, but becauſe it is a fygure, token or ſigne of Chriſtes boddy and blood repreſentynge his death, then it muſt needes be as damnable to looke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it, or beholde it vnwoorthyly, becauſe figures, tokens, and ſygnes perteyne rather, and more commonlie to the ſence of the ſight, then to anye eatynge or drynkynge other. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:12768:85"/>
vnwoorthy ſeyng or beholdyng of it, can be no leſſe faute, then is the vnwoorthy eatynge and drynkynge of it, if there be no more in it, then thou ſpeakeſt of. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let vs go farther and conſider this, that if it be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge els, but a figure, token, or ſygne of Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood repreſentynge his death, why is the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of damnacion declared vpon the vnworthy eatyng and drynkynge of that, more then vpon the vnwoorthy lookinge and beholdyng of the Crucifix or the roode? For that is a fygure, token, or ſigne of Chriſtes bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood repreſentynge his death to. whiche it doth much more aptly, muche more apparantly, much more lyuely, and therefore muche more profitablie, then the ſacramente doeth, if there bee no more in the ſacrament, then thou ſaiſt there is. For that the roode doth, it doth it moſt ſenſiblie. But that the ſacrament doth, it doth it ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t intelligibly.

                  <speaker>HERE.</speaker>
                  <p>The ſacrament hath in it, the ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſte. And the roode, but the ordinaunce of man. For Chriſte did inſtitute and ordeine the one, and man the other.</p>

                  <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
                  <p>Then thou muſte needes graunte that therein, the ordinaunce of man, is better then the ordinaunce of Chriſte. For euery figure, token, or ſigne, is alway ordeyned to ſignifie.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12768:85"/>
that it ſignifieth, then the ſacrament dooth, wherefore the roode muſte needes bee a better ſigne then the ſacramente is. Therefore if the roode bee (as it ſeemeth by Frith) a better ſigne then the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, And the better ſigne muſt nedes procede of the better ordinance, (as the better effect, of the better cauſe) it foloweth plaine, that the ordinance of man in the roode is better then the ordinance of Chriſte in the ſacrament.</p>

                  <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
                  <p>That is becauſe thou art not able to auoide it, as thou art not in dede, except thou graunt a better thing to be in the ſacrament, then any figure, token, or ſigne other. And a better there is none, but onely the verye thinge, that is thereby ſignified, which is the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of Chriſte. For what can be directly bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a ſigne in that kinde of thinges, but onely that, whiche it dooth ſignifie? becauſe there is no meane betweene them, wherof any compariſon is to be made, but onely of the one to the other, that is to ſaye, betweene them two. Therefore other thou muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des graunt the bleſſed body and blood of Chriſte to bee verely and really in the ſacrament, (whereby the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is made more and better, then is anye other fygure, token, or ſigne) or els thou muſt needes graunt the roode to be a better figure token or ſigne then the ſacrament is. And ſo the ordinaunce of man to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as I ſayd) in the one, then the ordinaunce of Chriſte in the other. Wherefore by this, (whiche thou dareſt not graunt) thou maiſt, if thou haue any grace, well perceiue the very cauſe why the ſacramente dooth in the Iudgement of all trew chriſten people, ſo farre paſſe

For although the roode be a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſygne and very expedient for vs to behoulde, yet it is not ordeyned but onely to refreſhe our memorie, fayth and deuocion.

Why dyd he leaue out that, and wolde not bringe it to light? he thought perchaunce that Saynt Ambroſe did not well to put it in. Or els he
<pb facs="tcp:12768:88"/>
thought to make an exchaynge with hym, and for that latyn worde, to gyue him in recompence, theſe three or foure Englyſhe woordes. That is to ſay, meaninge of the Sacramente. For what Latyn worde hathe Saynt Ambroſe here, that may be trewlie turned in to thys Engliſhe worde meaninge? Or into this worde Sacrament? If he haue here none ſuche, (as he hath not in deede) what foloweth, but that Frithe of purpoſe did put them in, to deceyue and make the ſymple Engliſhe reader beleue it to be, the minde of Saynt Ambroſe when it is but his owne falſe Hereticall practiſe, and nothinge els? As it may well appere by thys, that vnder the colour of a tranſlatour, he playeth here the falſe expoſiter. And why? but as I ſayde to ſeduce the reader. For where as Saynt Ambroſe doeth ioyne theſe wordes <hi>(huius rei)</hi> and thys worde <hi>(Memores)</hi> together, whiche are to ſay, myndefull of thys thynge, Frithe putteth away this worde, <hi>memores,</hi> and ioyneth to <hi>huius rei,</hi> theſe wordes, <hi>in edendo &amp; potando.</hi>

For this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whiche thou doeſt receiue, is made by the worde of Chriſt. For if the woorde of Helias was ſo ſtronge, that it brought doune fyre from heauen, ſhall not the woorde of Chriſte be ſo ſtronge, that it maie chaynge kyndes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementes? Thou haſte redde of the woorkes of the whole worlde, that he ſpake the woord, and they were made, he commaunded, and they were create.</p>
                     <p>Therefore can not the woord of Chriſte, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make that of nothinge, which was not, chainge thoſe thinges that are, into that which they were not? For it is not leſſe, to geue new natures to thinges, then it is to chaynge them.</p>

                  <p>And Saint ambroſe doth ſay.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo after him, there remaineth no ſubſtannce nor nature of bread and wyne at all. But after Gelaſius there remaineth both. Wherfore theſe two doctours be directly one againſt another.</p>

                  <p>Then is Frith not onely therein againſt the, but alſo againſt him ſelfe to. For thou knoweſt (as I tolde the before) that he doth in theſe woordes aſke this queſtion.</p>
                  <p>

Frith ſcaped not ſo, but was quickly taken for an heretyke, as he was moſte woorthy. Therefore if they had diſſented in this great matter one from an other (as Frith doth ſay, they did not) there is no doubt, but one of them both, had bene an heretyke in dede, and coulde not haue ſcaped away withall, thus longe in the Churche of Chriſte, without the worthy infamie and note therof.</p>

                  <p>Of their agrement I haue no doubt. But whether they be the very words of Gelaſius which Frith doth here alledge of him or no, I haue ſome doubt of that, becauſe he doth not ſhow, nor note in what place of Gelaſius woorkes, we maie fynde them. But let vs graunt him the moſt he can aſke, that they be the verye wordes of Gelaſius in deede. And therefore let me ſee what he can gette by that?</p>

                  <p>No more but euen as the very woordes of Gelaſius doth declare, whiche are playne, that</p>

                     <q>It dooth not ceaſe to be the ſubſtance or nature of bread and wyne, but they continew in the propertee of their owne nature.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore what doubt can there be, in the meaninge of

theſe ſo plaine wordes?</p>

                  <p>Some perchaunce in this, that he ſaith, it ceaſeth not to be the ſubſtance or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bread and wyne. He ſaith not the ſubſtance and nature, but the ſubſtaunce or nature, As doubtynge whiche of them both he myght beſt ſay. And therfore it is incertaine to Frith, whiche of them both he ment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>HERE.</speaker>
                  <p>That is not ſo. For there is no doubt, but Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius ment as well the one as the other, and referreth to vs, the libertee of vnderſtanding or taking of whiche we lyſt, becauſe although they be two wordes, yet they are both of one ſignification.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
                  <p>They are ſome tyme confounded (thou maiſt ſay) and taken one for an other, But yet not bothe of one proper ſignifycacyen for all that. For ſubſtaunce perteyneth properly to the pryncipall beynge of a body, makyng it to be the ſame that it is. And nature, althoughe it bee ſome tyme taken more generally or largely for the whole thinge, yet commonly it perteyneth but to the accidentall qualitees, and propertees thereof, declarynge it to bee rather ſuche as it is, then what it is. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Fryth ſaye, that Gelaſius ment both ſubſtance and nature, that I maie well denie, becauſe his woordes be diſiunctiuelie ſpoken, of the one, or the other.</p>

                  <speaker>HER.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet maie we then chooſe, and take which of them we will.</p>

                  <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay not ſo. For thereof Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius maketh a reſtraynt him ſelfe, if thou marke it well. For when he dooth ſay, They continew in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertee of their nature, he ſayth not, in the propertee of their ſubſtaunce. Whiche had bene as much to ſaye, as in the propertee of their chiefe and principall beynge,
<pb facs="tcp:12768:95"/>
For of the ſubſtaunce euery thynge that is a body, (as breadde and alſo wyne is) hath his nominacion. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith not in the propertee of their ſubſtaunce.</p>
                  <p>But in the propertee of their nature, as of a leſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge then of ſubſtaunce. And yet euen therein, this is alſo to be noted to, that he ſayth not in their nature, but in the propertee of their nature. For nature and the propertee of nature, is not without a difference, as it is well proued by this, that the one procedeth and is ſayde of the other. For the propertee of nature, is but the operacion of it accordynge to the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Whereof nature is ſome tyme letted by one occaſion or other. And yet then, althoughe it be ſo put or let from the proper operacion thereof, it is neuertheleſſe nature ſtyll for all that. And therefore Gelaſius, to amende or qualyfye, his woordes of ſubſtaunce or nature, and to auoyde all ſynyſter vnderſtandynge therof, doth adde vnto them and ſaye, They continew in the propertee of their nature. As he mighte ſaie, I do not meane the verye ſubſtaunce or nature it ſelfe, but the naturall quantitees, qualitees, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees thereof. Wherefore, if he had ment (as Frith dooth take him to meane) the very ſubſtaunce or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe of breadde and wyne ſtyll to remayne in deede, it had beene ſuperfluous and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but rather a very folly to tell vs, (as he dooth) that they continew in the propertee of their nature.</p>
                  <p>For who doeth not know, that all ſubſtanciall and naturall thinges, for the tyme of their beyng, do conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in the propertee of theyr nature? Therefore, Gelaſius was to wyſe, and to well learned, to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12768:95"/>
teache vs that, for a ſpeciall or a neceſſary leſſon, whych euery man knoweth alredy.</p>

                  <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
                  <p>Ye but euery man doeth not knowe that they ſo do, wythout their owne proper ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>And that is the cauſe, why Gelaſius doeth ſo ſay therof as he doeth. For els he ſhould ſpeake it wythout cauſe or any neede at all. And that he wolde not do. For yf he had thought or ment, that the very ſubſtance or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe, of breade and wyne, had therin contynued ſtyll, he wolde not haue ſayde they contynew in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertee of theyr nature, whiche euery man knoweth, but he wolde haue ſayde they contynew in the verytee of theyr ſubſtance, becauſe the contrary therof, is wel and trewly beleued. For therin lyeth all the doubt or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion if anie be. In ſo muche, that when it is hearde, that the ſubſtance or nature of a thynge doeth ceaſe to be, it is thought, by and by, that the propertee thereof doeth ceaſe wythall, becauſe in the common courſe of thinges, it doeth ſo in deed. This ſame thought therfore, did Gelaſius intende to helpe, when he ſayth, they conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in the propertie of their nature. As who ſaye, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe theyr proper ſubſtance and nature be chaynged yet they continew in the propertee of theyr nature for al that, and in nothing els, as the trewth is, they do not in deede. Agayne of the other ſyde, when it is hearde, that the propertee of nature in any thynge, doeth holde and contynew, it is thought ſtreyght way, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce and nature of the thynge, doeth alſo contynew likewiſe. Wherefore that ſame thought, dyd Saynt Ambroſe purpoſe to helpe, when and where he doeth
<pb facs="tcp:12768:96"/>
ſay, that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thorow benediction the nature is chaynged. And thorow the conſecration, ther <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> made of the breade, the fleſhe of Chriſte. And thorow the operation of Chriſtes wordes, there is made of the wyne and water, the bloud whyche redemed the people. And as our Lorde Ieſus Chryſte is the very ſonne of God, ſo it is very fleſhe (as he ſayth him ſelfe) whiche we receaue.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here thou mayſt playnlie perceyue, according to the agrement of theſe two doctours, how the one defendeth the other. For who ſo euer wolde take and gather of S. Ambroſe, that there doeth not remayne the naturall propertee of breade and wyne, becauſe he ſpeaketh ſo playne of the alteration and chaynge of the ſubſtance or nature therof, Gelaſius doeth directly for hym anſwer and ſay, they contynew in the popertee of theyr nature. That is to ſay, the propertee of theyr nature doeth contynew ſtyll, althoughe the ſubſtance or nature it ſelfe be chaynged. And who ſo euer wolde, for this ſayinge, take and gather of Gelaſius (as Fryth doth) that there remayneth the very ſubſtance or nature of breade and wyne ſtyll, becauſe he ſpeaketh ſo playne, of the continewance of the naturall propertee thereof, Saynt Ambroſe doeth in that behalfe, directlie anſwer and ſay, that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thorow benediction the nature is chaynged. And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration there is made of the breade, the fleſhe of Chriſt, and ſo foorth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherfore, by thys it doeth moſte clerely appere, that Frithe was not deceaued in that he ſayeth, theſe fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fathers dyſſented not one from an other, but well and trewlie agreed together. But how therefore,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12768:96"/>
doeth he agree with him ſelfe, in this that he ſo ſayeth, and yet aloweth not ſo muche the ſayinge of the one, as he dooeth vtterlye deny the ſayinge of the other? when dyrectelie agaynſt Saynt Ambroſe he doeth ſay, there remayneth the ſubſtaunce and nature of bread and wyne. Who can be more agaynſt hym, then he is herein agaynſt hym ſelfe? He holdeth wyth the ſaying of Gelaſius, but not with the ſaying of Saynt Ambroſe. And yet doeth holde, that they diſſent not one from an other. Haſte thou hearde of any man, that euer framed hys thynges together after this ſorte?</p>

                  <p>That is to ſay, wyth none of them boeth. For it is two thinges for hym, to holde with them, and to holde wyth his owne falſe vnderſtandinge of them, as he, thou, and manie other doeth. For yf he ſought in them anie thinge els but that, he wolde not (as he did) pyke out onlie ſuche places, as be to the ſimple reader darke and obſcure, but wolde haue ſet foorthe as well ſuche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, as are cleare and out of all queſtion, and not omitte or rather hyed them (as I tolde thee before) euen purpoſly to deceue.</p>

                  <p>Why doeſt thou aſke of me that queſtion, ſithe indede, he tooke it not ſo? for when the worde hath dyuerſe and manie meaninges, how coulde Frith be ſure to take the meaning according to the worde, before he had made it certayne, in whyche of thoſe meanynges the worde is put? For ſubſtance, is a worde of ſuche a ſorte, as by that, is mente ſome tyme one thynge and ſome tyme an other. In ſo muche, that ſome tyme it is taken for wordlie goodes, by reaſon whereof, we ſay of a ryche man, that he is a man of greate ſubſtance. Some tyme, when we beholde a goodly new buyldinge, we ſay that it is ſubſtancially done. There, ſubſtaunce is applied partlie to the ſtrengthe of the thynge to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynew, and partely to the connynge of the artificer.</p>
                  <p>Alſo it is ſome tyme taken for a certayne quantytee of ſtuffe, and ſome qualytee of workemanſhyp.</p>
                  <p>As when a man commeth to a Drapers ſhoppe, to hye hym a Cloke or a gowne clothe, and hathe an endee of the peace turned oute vnto hym to looke vpon, he deſyreth at lengthe to ſee the other ende of it, and when he hathe felte that in hys hande,
<pb facs="tcp:12768:99"/>
ye marry ſayeth he, here is an other maner of ſubſtance in thys ende, then is in the other, cut me therefore that I ſhall haue, oute of this ende. Therefore what meaneth he, by that other maner of ſubſtance, but a more quantitee of ſtuffe, and ſome qualite of better makynge in that ende, then in the other. For the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſubſtance of bothe the endes, and alſo of the whole clothe, after the Logition, is all one. But not ſo after the common vſe of ſpeakynge. Agayne it is alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſometyme, for the pythe or pryncipall parte of a tale. As when we heare a man longe aboute the vtteringe thereof, we byd hym go quicklie to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the matter. Subſtance is not there, taken after the logition nother, but after the common ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. Beſyde thys, it is ſome tyme taken for nature it ſelfe, as nature is alſo taken for it, and that as though there were no difference betwene them. And ſo doeth Gelaſius put it here, when he ſayeth.</p>
                  <q>It ceaſeth not to be the ſubſtance or nature of breade and wyne.</q>
                  <p>Meaninge indeede none of them bothe after the logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But yet in that he doeth ſay, ſubſtance or nature, he putteth no difference betwene them, but (as thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deſt before) take whiche we liſt, it is all one to hym.
For yf they had not beene to hym as bothe one in thys caſe, he wolde not haue put as he did, the one or the other. As who ſaye I care not whiche ye take, but he wolde haue put the one and the other, (as two diſtincte) or the one and not the other, (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in had beene no queſtion) or els nether of them bothe. Therefore ſythe it was all one to hym, to take of them,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12768:99"/>
whiche we liſte, it foloweth well, that he did not put the one, but for the other. And whiche for other, that was, his owne order of woordes doth well declare. Which is not, nature or ſubſtaunce, but ſubſtaunce or nature. He putteth ſubſtaunce before, for that which he putteth after, as an expoſicion thereof. That is to ſay, nature. Therfore he ſaith ſubſtaunce or nature, as who ſay by ſubſtaunce I meane nothynge els but nature. For if he had put nature for ſubſtaunce, as he doth ſubſtaunce for nature, he wolde not haue ioyned vnto them theſe woordes, ſaiyng, they continew in the propertee of their nature, but he wold haue ſaid, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew in the proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te of ther ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. How be it, he wold not ſay ſo, becauſe it had bene directly agaynſt his purpoſe. Wherfore euen as he dooth put ſubſtaunce for nature, ſo in very deede, he doth put nature for the propertee of nature. And therfore as a playne expoſicion of his mynde therein he doth ſay, they continew in the propertee of their nature. As who ſay therein is all the beynge they haue. For if he had thought them to haue any other, or more beynge then that, it had bene but a vayne ſaiynge of him, to ſay that they continew in the propertie of their nature, when it had bene farre better, more certaine, and playner, to ſay they continue in their very ſubſtaunce, or very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe, which towcheth ther whole beynge, where as the propertee of their nature, toucheth but a parte of it. For the proper nature of bread and wyne it ſelfe, and the propertee of their nature, is two thinges. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gelaſius ſaith not, that they continew in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature, but in the propertee of their nature, which is leſſe. And ſo muche of bread and wyne, we graunte
<pb facs="tcp:12768:100"/>
to remaine in the holy ſacrament, as well after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecracion as before. And yet not afterwarde, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or nature of bread and wyne for all that, excepte thou take nature, for the onely accidentall quantitees, qualitees, and propertees therof, as it is oft tymes vſed to be taken. Ye and ſomtime for the condicions and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of men, both good and badde. As when we ſee a man of a cuſtomable gentle behauiour, we ſay, he is a man of a gentle nature. Againe when we ſee a man of the contrary ſorte, and alway intractable, we ſay he is a a man of a ſtraynge nature, or a man of an euill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And as ſome will ſay, I neuer ſaw man of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And yet all men are but of one nature, as nature is ſome way taken. Therfore when ſubſtaunce and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both, may and daily are, ſo diuerſly vſed and taken, as they are in dede, what can Frith (for all his craakes) get of gelaſius, by thoſe words? he ſhould firſt haue tried and made it certaine, how or in what ſence gelaſius dyd put them and what he meaneth by them. And then ſo to allege them with their dew expoſicion accordingly. But that, becauſe he neuer vſed to do with S. auſt. nor S. am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, he thought it to late to begyn it with Gelaſius·
For he did better like the firſt ſound of thoſe words after his owne minde, then he did the very meanyng of them, after gelaſius mynde. Wherfore this maiſt thou ſee how very nothing Gelaſius maketh for him, although they were the very woordes of Gelaſius in deede. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what if they bee not his woordes? how then?</p>

                  <p>Then for a farther triall thereof, I wolde wiſhe the to take ſo muche payne (which were not great) as to reade ouer that notable and worthy booke, intituled, (the aſſercion and defence of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the aulter) made by maiſter doctour Smith of Oxforde a man well known to be of great and famouſe learnyng. Wherin amonge other his good and perfecte ſolutions, to a great ſorte of Frithes hereticall obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thou ſhalt fynde one ſolution concernyng this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the .148. leafe of the ſaid booke, where part of the woordes be theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>For an anſwere here vnto (meanyng Frithes allegacion of Gelaſius) ye ſhall vnderſtand (ſaith he) that this ſaiyng aſcrybed vnto Gelaſius, beynge of this ſorte as it is, is neyther founde in anie of the woorkes reputed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the trew and vndoubted woorkes of Gelaſius, nor yet it is ſo redde in the ſayd booke, intituled, <hi>Antidotum contra hereſes,</hi> as here in this obiection it is deduced, like as it ſhall manifeſtly appere vnto the reader therof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrynge them both together. And vndoubtedly amonges learned catholyke men, it is conſtantly beleued, that this ſaiyng of Gelaſius, as it is here deduced, is falſly aſcry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto gelaſius, and counterfet by the lutherians, who (for the maintenance of their falſe errour and naughtie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion or hereſy, beyng that with the very trew body and blood of Chriſte, there remaineth materiall breadde and materiall wine) haue ſo contriued the matter, that where in all Gelaſius woorkes, there can not be founde any one ſaiynge after this ſort, they haue yet iobbed it in, in an other booke. Ye and to auoyde ſuſpicion of falſhed, and to get them the better credite, they haue put it in the ſayde booke, hauynge an honeſte name, beynge intytuled a tryacle or remedy agaynſte hereſies, thynkynge that in ſuche a booke, hauynge ſuche a title no man will
<pb facs="tcp:12768:101"/>
thinke that any hereſies are planted at all, to be maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in anye wyſe, But that in ſuche a booke all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritees and catholike aſſertions are ſet forth to bee allowed. And that this is very lyke te be as I do ſay, it appereth in maner notoriouſly of it ſelfe, as well for that the ſayde ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge, as here it is deduced, is not (as I ſayde) amonges the other ſaiynges of Gelaſius in his knowne and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued woorkes, as alſo for that no writer (in the ſayd Gelaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us tyme) dyd eyther holde this opinion, ſo aſcribed to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius, nor yet any thynge ſpeaketh in or for the confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion therof, which vndoubtedly they woulde haue done, in caſe the thynge had bene ſo in deede, as it is deduced and purpoſed for trew, ſemblably as they did the lyke, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte all other errour and hereſies, whiche then dyd ſprynge and were ſowne abrode, eſpecially beyng of ſuch importaunce and weyght as this is of. Moreouer this thyng by the way (good reader) maie be noted to the great confuſion and ſhame of theſe falſifyers and corrupters of bookes (as Fryth is and other alſo of that ſorte) that the ſaiynge of Gelaſius is ſo here reherſed, that a plaine man wolde thinke that Gelaſius had ſo ſayde, as Fryth dooth here brynge him in, and lookyng vpon the boke intituled <hi>ANTIDOTVM,</hi> out of whiche, the ſaiynge of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius is extracted, there ſhall ye fynde farre otherwyſe. Ye and moreouer, the thynge whiche ye ſhall fynde there, in the foreſayde booke, it is ſo corrupted, that ye can not (as it is there) make any ſentence of it. &amp;c.</q>

                  <p>Now theſe wordes of this great learned mannes ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge foorth, with the reſte that folowe in the ſame place, if thou woldeſt thorowly reade, peruſe, and well way them with indifferent iudgement, thou ſhouldeſt eaſyly perceyue, whether there be ſo muche as anye lykelyhood that thoſe pretended woordes of Gelaſius be Gelaſius woordes in deede, or no. Therfore if they be not what doth Fryth get by them? Of the other ſide, if they were his woordes as Fryth doth ſay they be, yet
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12768:101"/>
well and trewly, waied, conſidered and with reaſon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, thou ſhouldeſt fynde (as it doth now already appere) that they make not onely nothynge for him, but alſo rather, euen cleane agaynſt him. Wherfore, ſith (as I told the at the fyrſt) that all frithes purpoſe in the olde holy doctours, was no more but only to get ſome colour of, or by ſuch certein ſaiynges of theirs, as he could &amp; did pyke out, to make it (as it were by them) ſeme that his vnderſtandynge of thoſe places of ſcripture, whiche he doth meddle with all, could not be but trew, pretending that they were to bee taken in the ſame onely ſenſe that he did put them for. And againe ſith it is now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the chiefe of all thoſe places of the holy fathers, whiche he did ſo pyke out, and moſte truſted vpon, he did but falſely vnderſtande after his own blinde phanſy, and not after their mindes, but far otherwyſe and clean contrary to their meanynges, as it hath moſt plainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, euen by the teſtimony of their owne ſaiynges, which I haue trewly recited vnto the, what folowth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of but this? if his vnderſtanding of thoſe places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be trew, thers is falſe. if theirs be trew, his is falſe. And whiche ſhall we take? for both, we can not they be ſo contrary. Therefore becauſe their vnderſtandyng thereof, is well knowne to be ſo trew, that euen he him ſelfe nother did nor durſte deny it, and his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng ſo falſe, that all the colour and craft he could ſet apon it, is not able to defend nor hide it, who is ſo blind, weywarde, and wylfull, as, notwithſtandynge al this, will yet truſt or beleue him? any other but ſuche, as paſſeth not muche, whether they go to god or the diuel? wherefore, if the dew conſideracion hereof, be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe
