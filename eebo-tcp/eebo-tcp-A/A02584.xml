            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

charity led me
into an error;
Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe
well
knowes how
apt I am to be
overtaken with theſe better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
of an over kinde credulitie. I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3877:4"/>
had thought that any daſh of my
pen, in a ſudden, and eaſie adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement,
might have ſerved to
have quitted that ignorant ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,
which was caſt upon my
miſ-taken aſſertion, of the true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of the Romane Church.
The iſſue proves all otherwiſe:
I finde, to my griefe, that the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding
tenacitie of ſome
zealous ſpirits hath made it a
quarrell. It cannot but trouble
me to ſee that the poſition, which
is ſo familiarly current with the
beſt reformed Divines; &amp; which
hath beene ſo oft and long ſince
publiſhed by mee without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
yea, not without the
approbation and applauſe of the
whole repreſentative body of the
Clergie of this kingdome, ſhould
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3877:4"/>
now be quarrelled, and drawne
into the deteſtation of thoſe that
know it not; As one therefore
that ſhould thinke it coroſive
enough, that any occaſion ſhould
be taken by ought of mine, to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
but one thred of that ſeamleſs
coat, I doe earneſtly deſire, by a
more full explication, to give
cleare ſatisfaction to all Readers;
and by this ſeaſonable reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to ſtop the flood-gates of
contention; I know it will not be
unpleaſing to your Lordſhip, that
through your honourable and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
hands, theſe welcome papers
ſhould be tranſmitted to many;
Wherein I ſhall firſt beſeech, yea
adjure al Chriſtians, under whoſe
eies they ſhall fall, by the dreadfull
name of that GOD, who ſhall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3877:5"/>
judge both the quicke, and the
dead, to lay aſide all unjuſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices;
and to allow the words of
Truth, and Peace; I dare confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
ſay, Let us be underſtood,
and we are agreed.</p>
            <p>The ſearcher of all harts knows
how far it was from my thoughts
to ſpeak ought in favour of the
Roman Synagogue: If I have not
ſufficiently branded that Stru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet, I
juſtly ſuffer. <hi>Luthers</hi> broad word is
by me already both ſafely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Ob.</note>
&amp; ſufficiently vindicated. But,
doe you not ſay, It is a true viſible
Church? Doe you not yeeld ſome
kinde of communion with theſe
clients of Antichriſt? What is, if
this be not, favour? Marke well,
Chriſtian Reader, and the Lord
give thee underſtanding in all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3877:5"/>
things:<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> To beginne with the
latter; No man can ſay but the
Church of Rome holds ſome
Truths; thoſe truths are Gods,
and in his right, ours, why ſhould
not wee challenge our owne,
whereſoever we finde it? If a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Devill ſhall ſay of Chriſt, <hi>Thou
art the Sonne of the living God,</hi> wee
will ſnatch this truth out of his
mouth, as uſurped; and in ſpight
of him, proclaime it for our own.
Indeed; there is no communion
betwixt light and darkneſſe, but
there is communion betwixt
light and light; Now all truth is
light, and therefore ſymbolizeth
with it ſelfe. With that light,
therefore, whoſe glimmering yet
remaines in their darkneſſe, our
clearer light will, and muſt hold
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3877:6"/>
communion; If they profeſſe
three Perſons in one Godhead;
two natures in one perſon of
Chriſt; ſhall we detrect to joine
with them in this Chriſtian veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
We abhorre to have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
in their idolatrous or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
practices, theſe are their
owne, not ours. If we durſt have
taken their part in theſe, this
breach had not beene; Now who
can but ſay that wee muſt hate
their evill, and allow their good?
It is no countenance to their errors
that we imbrace our owne truths;
It is no diſparagement to our
truths, that they have blended
them with their errors: Here can
be no difference, then, if this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
bee not miſ-taken; no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3877:6"/>
man will ſay that we may ſever
from their common truths; No
man will ſay that we may joyne
with them in their hatefull er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p>For the former; Hee that ſaith
a theefe is truly a man, doth hee
therein fauour that theefe? He that
ſaith, a diſeaſed, dropſied, dying
bodie, is a true (though corrupt)
body, doth he favour that diſeaſe,
or that living carcaſſe? It is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
no more that I ſay of the
Church of Rome: Trueneſſe of
being, and outward viſibility, are
no praiſe to her; Yea, theſe are ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations
to her falſhood: The
advantage that is both ſought and
found in this aſſertion is onely
ours; as we ſhall ſee in the ſequell,
without any danger of their gain.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3877:7"/>
I ſay, then, that ſhe is a true church,
but, I ſay withall, ſhee is a falſe
Church: True in exiſtence, but
falſe in beleefe: Let not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monymie
of a word breed jarres,
where the ſenſe is accorded: If
we doe not yeeld her the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Church, why do we call
her the Church of Rome? What
ſpeake we of? or where is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our queſtion? who ſees
not that there is a morall trueneſs,
and a naturall? He that is moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the falſeſt man, is, in nature, as
truly a man, as the honeſteſt; and
therefore in this regard as true a
man: In the ſame ſenſe therefore
that wee ſay the Devill is a true
(though falſe) ſpirit; that a cheater
it a true (though falſe) man, wee
may &amp; muſt ſay, that the Church
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3877:7"/>
of Rome is a true (though falſe)
Church; Certainely, there hath
beene a true errour, and miſ-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the ſenſe that is guiltie of
this quarrell. As for the viſibility,
there can be no queſtion: Would
God, that Church did not too
much fill our eie, yea the world;
There is nothing wherein it doth
more pride it ſelfe, than in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
conſpicuitie, ſcorning, in
this regard, the obſcure paucitie
of their oppoſers.</p>
            <p>But you ſay,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> What is this but
to play with ambiguities; That
the Church of Rome is it ſelfe,
that is, a Church; that it is viſible;
that it is truly exiſtent, there can
be no doubt; but is it ſtill a part
of the truly exiſtent, viſible church
of Chriſt?<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> Surely, no otherwiſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3877:8"/>
than an hereticall and Apoſtaticall
Church is, and may be: Reader,
whoſoever thou art, for Gods
ſake, for thy ſoules ſake, marke
where thou treadeſt; Elſe thou
ſhalt bee ſure to fall either into an
open gulfe of uncharitableneſſe,
or into a dangerous precipice of
errour. There is no feare, nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſay, that the Church of
Rome, under a Chriſtian face,
hath an Antichriſtian heart; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
that foundation by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
inferences, which by open
profeſſion in avoweth: That face,
that profeſſion, thoſe avowed
principles are enough to give it
claime to a true outward viſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of a Chriſtian Church; whiles
thoſe damnable inferences are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to feoffe it in the true ſtyle
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3877:8"/>
of hereſie, and Antichriſtianiſme;
Now, this hereſie, this Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſme
makes Rome juſtly odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and execrable to God, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and Men; but cannot utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſchurch it, whiles thoſe main
principles maintaine a weake life
in that crazie, and corrupted
bodie.</p>
            <p>But is not this language diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that whereto our eares
and eies have beene inured, from
the mouthes, and pens of ſome
reverend Divines and profeſſors
of our Church? Know, Reader,
that the ſtreame of the famous
Doctors, both at home, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
hath runne ſtrongly my
way: I ſhould have feared, and
hated to goe alone; what reaſon
is there then to ſingle out one man
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3877:9"/>
in a throng? Some few worthie
Authors have ſpoken otherwiſe,
in the warmth of their zealous
contention; yet ſo, as that even to
them durſt I appeale for my Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
for if their ſound differ from
me, their ſenſe agrees with me:
that, which as I touched in my
Advertiſement, ſo I am now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to make cleare by the inſtance
of learned <hi>Zanchius;</hi> whoſe preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
teſtimonies compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſhall plainly teach us, how
eaſie a reconcilement may bee
made betwixt theſe two, ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-contrarie,
opinions: That wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Author, in his profeſſion of
Chriſtian Religion, which hee

yeare of his age, having defined
the Church of Chriſt in generall,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3877:9"/>
and paſſed thorow the properties
of it, at laſt, deſcending to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſion
of the Church militant,
comes to inquire, how particular
Churches may be knowne to be
the true churches of Chriſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he determines thus. <hi>Illas igitur,
&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe Churches therefore
doe wee acknowledge for the
true Churches of Chriſt; in which
firſt of all, the pure doctrine of the
Goſpell is preached, heard, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and ſo onely admitted, that
there is neither place, nor eare gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the contrarie: For both
theſe are the juſt propertie of the
flocke or ſheepe of Chriſt; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
both to heare the voice of their
owne Paſtor, and to reject the
voice of ſtrangers. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 4. In
which, ſecondly, the Sacraments
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3877:10"/>
inſtituted by Chriſt, are lawfully,
and (as much as may bee) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Chriſts inſtitution, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred,
and received; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in which the Sacraments
deviſed by men are not admitted,
and allowed; In which laſtly, the
diſcipline of Chriſt hath the due
place; that is, where both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely,
and privately, charitable
care is had, both by admonitions,
corrections, and at laſt (if need be)
by excommunications, that the
Commandements of God be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kept, and that all perſons live
ſoberly, iuſtly, and piouſly, to the
glory of God, and edification of
their neighbour. Thus hee;
wherein, who ſees not how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
he aymes, both at the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of our Churches, and the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3877:10"/>
caſheering of the Roman, which
is palpably guiltie of the violation
of theſe wholſome rules? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
it muſt needes be ſaid, if we
bring the Roman Church to this
touch, ſhe is caſt for a meer coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit;
ſhee is as farre from truth,
as truth is from falſhood: Now
by this time you goe away with
an opinion that learned <hi>Zanchie</hi>
is my profeſſed adverſarie, and
hath directly condemned my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
of the trueneſſe, and viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the Roman Church: Have
but patience, I beſeech you, to read
what the ſame excellent Author
writes, in his golden Preface to
that noble worke, <hi>De natura Dei;</hi>
where this queſtion is clearly, &amp;
punctuall decided: There you
ſhall finde, that having paſſed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3877:11"/>
through the wofull and gloomie
offuſcations of the Church of
God, in all former ages, he, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the darkneſſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Babylon; concludes thus:
<hi>Deinde non potuit Satan, &amp;c.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
Satan could not, in the verie
Roman Church, doe what he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
as hee had done in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne;
to bring all things to ſuch
paſſe, as that it ſhould no more
have the forme of a Chriſtian
Church; For, in ſpight of Satan,
that Church retained ſtill the chief
foundations of the faith, although
weakned with the doctrines of
men; it retained the publique prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word of God, thogh
in many places miſ-underſtood,
and miſ-conſtrued; the invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the name of Chriſt, though
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3877:11"/>
joyned alſo with the invocation
of dead men; the adminiſtration
of Baptiſme, inſtituted by Chriſt
himſelfe, howſoever defiled with
the addition of many ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
So as, together with the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole
of the covenant, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
it ſelfe remained ſtill in her;
I meane in all the Churches of the
Weſt, no otherwiſe than it did in
the Church of Iſrael, even after
that all things were in part profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and other impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and Idolatrous Kings, upon
the defection made by them from
the Church, and Tribe of <hi>Iuda;</hi>
For, neither doe I aſſent to them
which would have the Church
of Rome to have no leſſe ceaſed
to be the Church of Chriſt, than
thoſe Eaſterne Churches, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3877:12"/>
afterwards turned Mahumetan;
what Church was ever more
corrupt than the Church of the
ten Tribes, yet we learne from the
Scriptures, that it was ſtill the
Church of God? And how doth
S. <hi>Paul</hi> call that Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Antichriſt (hee ſaith) ſhall ſit,
the Temple of God? neither is it
any Baptiſme at all, that is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
out of the Church of Chriſt.
The wife that is an Adultereſſe,
doth not ceaſe to be a wife, unleſſe
being deſpoiled of her mariage-ring,
ſhe be manifeſtly divorced:
The Church of Rome, therefore,
is yet the Church of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but
what manner of Church? Surely
ſo corrupted and depraved, and
with ſo great tyrannie oppreſſed,
that you can neither, with a good
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3877:12"/>
conſcience, partake with them, in
their holy things, nor ſafely dwell
amongſt them. Thus he againe;
Wherein you ſee hee ſpeakes as
home for me, as I could deviſe to
ſpeake for my ſelfe: and as appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely
profeſſeth to oppoſe the
contrarie.</p>
            <p>Looke, now how this learned
Author may be reconciled to his
owne pen; and by the very ſame
way, ſhall my pen bee reconciled
with others: Either he agrees not
with himſelfe, or elſe, in his ſenſe,
I agree with my gainſayers: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more plaine, then that hee
in that former ſpeech, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
claſſicke Authors, that ſpeake
in that Key, meane, by a <hi>True
Church,</hi> a ſound, pure, right belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Church; ſo as their <hi>vera</hi> is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3877:13"/>
rather <hi>verax:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. de nat. Dei.</note> 
               <hi>Zanchie</hi> explicates
the terme, whiles he joines <hi>veram
&amp; puram</hi> together; ſo as in this
conſtruction it is no true Church
that is an unſound one; as if truth
of exiſtence were all one with
truth of doctrine: In this ſenſe,
whoſoever ſhall ſay the Church
of Rome is a true Church, I ſay he
calls evill good, and is no better
than a teacher of lyes. But, if we
meaſure the true being of a viſible
Church, by the direct mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of fundamentall principles,
though by conſequences indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overturned, and by the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the word of God, and his
Sacraments, though not without
ſoule adulteration; what judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Chriſtian can but, with mee,
ſubſcribe to learned <hi>Zanchius,</hi> that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3877:13"/>
the Church of Rome hath yet the
true viſibilitie of a Church of
Chriſt: what ſhould I need to
preſs the latitude, and multiplicity
of ſenſe of the word, <hi>Church;</hi>
there is no one term that I know,
in all uſe of ſpeech, ſo various; If,
in a large ſenſe, it be taken to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the ſociety of all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
Chriſtian Religion, through
the whole world, howſoever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pured,
who can denie this title to
the Roman? If, in a ſtrict ſenſe, it
be taken (as it is by <hi>Zanchius</hi> here,
and all thoſe Divines who refuſe
to give this ſtyle to the Synagogue
of Rome) for the companie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
faithfull men gathered into
one myſticall bodie under one

juſtified by his merits, ſanctified

of expreſſion, which gives ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
to the Adverſarie, offence

let me beſeech thee, in the bowels
of Chriſt, to weigh well this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and then tell me why ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
ſuch advantage ſhould bee
rather given by my words, than
by the ſame words, in the mouth
of <hi>Luther,</hi> of <hi>Calvin,</hi> of <hi>Zanchie, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,

And why more by my words,
now, than twentie yeares agoe, at
which time I publiſhed the ſame
truth, in a more ful and liberall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
Wiſe and charitable
Chriſtians may not be apt to take
offence where none is given. As
for anie Advantage that is hereby
given to the Adverſaries, they
may put it in their eye, and ſee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the worſe. Loe; ſay they,
we are of the true viſible Church;
this is enough for us; why are we
forſaken, why are we preſecuted,
why are we ſolicited to change?
Alas, poore ſoules, doe they not
know, that Hypocrites, leud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
reprobates, are no leſſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the true viſible Church?
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3877:15"/>
what gaine they by this but a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

but to ſay, they are neither Iewes,
nor Turkes, nor Pagans; but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers,
damnablie hereticall in
opinion, ſhamefullie idolatrous
in practice; Let them make their

in this ſtyle, may we never
proſper if we envie them this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
Our care ſhall be, that, beſides

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3877:16"/>
in a fruitleſſe viſibilitie, wee may

            </p>
            <p>Neither may the Reader think,
that I affect to goe by-waies of
ſpeech: no, I had not taken this
path, unleſſe I had found it both
more beaten, and fairer: I am not
ſo unwiſe, to teach the Adverſarie
what diſadvantage I conceive to
be given to our moſt juſt cauſe, by
the other manner of explication.
Let it ſuffice to ſay, that this form
of defence more fully ſtops the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
mouth in thoſe two
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3877:16"/>
maine and envious ſcandals,
which hee caſts upon our holy
Religion, Defection from the
Church, and Innovation; than
which, no ſuggeſtion hath wont
to bee more prevalent with
weake, and ungrounded hearts,
what wee further win by this,
not more charitable, than ſafe
<hi>Tenet,</hi> I had rather it ſhould bee
ſilently conceived by the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
then blazoned by my
free penne; ſhortly, in this ſtate
of the queſtion, our gaine is as
cleare, as the Adverſaries loſſe:
our ancient Truth triumphes
over their upſtart errours, our
charitie over their mercileſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions;
Feare not therefore,
deare brethren, where there is
on roome for danger; Suſpect
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3877:17"/>
not fraud where there is nothing
but plaine, honeſt, ſimplicitie of
intentions; cenſure not where
there is the ſame Truth, clad in a
different, but more eaſie habite
of words; But if any mans fervent
zeale ſhall rather draw him to the
liking of that other, rougher, and
harder way, ſo as in the meane
time he keepe within the bounds
of Chriſtian charitie, I taxe him
not; let everie man abound in
his owne ſenſe; Onely let our
hearts, and tongues, and hands,
conſpire together in peace with
our ſelves, in warre with our
common enemies.</p>
            <p>Thus farre have I (Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable)
in a deſire of peace,
poured out my ſelfe into a plaine
explication, and eaſie accordance:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3877:17"/>
Thoſe whom I ſtrive to ſatisfie,
are onely miſ-takers; whoſe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
if ſome man would have
either laught out, or deſpiſed, yet
I have condeſcended to take off
by a ſerious deprecation, and
juſt defence.</p>
            <p>It is an vnreaſonable motion
to requeſt mindes prepoſſeſſed
with prejudice to heare reaſon;
Whole Volumes are nothing to
ſuch as have contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
onely to take up opinions
upon truſt, and will hold them,
becauſe they know where they
had them: In vaine ſhould I ſpend
my ſelfe in beating upon ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viles;
but for thoſe ingenuous
Chriſtians, which will hold an
eare open for juſtice, and truth, I
have ſaid enough, if ought at all
needed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:3877:18"/>
Alas, my Lord, I ſee and grieve
to ſee it; it is my Rochet that hath
offended, and not I; In another
habit, I, long ſince, publiſhed this,
and more, without diſlike; It is
this colour of innocence that hath
bleared ſome over-tender eyes;
Wherein I know not whether I
ſhould more pittie their errour,
or applaud my owne ſufferings;
although I may not ſay with the
Pſalmiſt, <hi>What hath the righteous
done?</hi> Let mee (I beſeech your
Lordſhip) upon this occaſion,
have leave to give a little vent to
my juſt griefe in this point.</p>
            <p>The other day I fell upon a
Latine Pamphlet, homely for
ſtyle, tedious for length, zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uncharitable for ſtuffe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Author (onely wiſe in this,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3877:18"/>
that he would bee unknowne)
in a grave fierceneſſe flies in the
face of our Engliſh Prelacie; not
ſo much enveighing againſt their
Perſons, (which he could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to reverence) as their verie
places. I bleſt my ſelfe to ſee the
caſe ſo altered: Heretofore, the
Perſon had wont to beare off
manie blowes from the function;
now the verie function wounds
the perſon: In what caſe are we,
when that which ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
reſpect, brands us? What
blacke Art hath raiſed up this
ſpirit of <hi>Aerius</hi> from his pit? Wo
is mee, that zeale ſhould breed
ſuch monſters of conceit: It is
the honour, the Pompe, the
wealthe, the pleaſure (hee ſaith) of
the Epiſcopall Chaire that is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3877:19"/>
of the depravation of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
and if himſelfe were ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layd
with greatneſſe, hee ſhould
ſuſpect his owne fidelitie. Alas,
poore man, at what diſtance doth
hee ſee us? Foggie Ayre uſeth to
repreſent everie object farre big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than it is. Our Sauiour in his
temptation upon the Mount,
had onely the glorie of thoſe
Kingdomes ſhowed to him, by
that ſubtile Spirit, not the cares,
and vexations; Right ſo are our
dignities exhibited to theſe envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
beholders; Little doe theſe
men ſee the toyles, and anxieties
that attend this ſuppoſedly-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
eminence.</p>
            <p>All the revenge that I would
wiſh to this uncharitable Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,
ſhould bee this, that hee
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3877:19"/>
might bee but for a while adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to this ſo glorious ſeate of
mine; that ſo his experience might
taſte the bewitching pleaſures of
this envied greatneſſe; hee ſhould
well finde more danger of being
over-ſpent with worke, than of
languiſhing with eaſe &amp; delicacie.</p>
            <p>For mee I need not appeale to
Heaven: Eyes enow can witneſſe
how few free houres I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
ſince I put on theſe Robes
of ſacred honour. In ſo much as
I could finde in my heart, with
holy <hi>Gregorie,</hi> to complaine of my
change; were it not, that I ſee theſe
publique troubles are ſo many
acceptable ſervices to my God,
whoſe glorie is the end of my
being: Certainly, my Lord, if
none but earthly reſpects ſhould
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3877:20"/>
ſway me, I ſhould heartily wiſh
to change this Pallace (which the
Providence of God, and the
bountie of my gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
hath put mee into) for my
quiet Cell at <hi>Waltham,</hi> where I
had ſo ſweet leaſure to enjoy
God, your Lordſhip, and my ſelfe:
But I have followed the calling of
my God, to whoſe ſervice I am
willingly ſacrificed; and muſt
now, in an holy obedience to his
Divine Majeſtie, with what
cheerefulneſſe I may, ride out all
the ſtormes of envie, which una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
will alight vpon the

greatneſſe; in the meane time,
what ever I may ſeeme to others,
I was never leſſe in my owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions;
and, were it not for

is the vſuall acception
of the Word, True, in our

Beeing vnto all theſe, but thoſe
Due Qualities, or Requiſite
Actions wherby they are made
commendable or Praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
in their ſeuerall kinds. In
this ſenſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is
no more a True Church in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Chriſt, or thoſe due
Qualities, and proper Actions
which Chriſt requires; then an
arrant whore is a True and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Wife vnto her Husband I
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3877:35"/>
durſt vpon mine oath be one of
your Compurgators, that you
neuer intended to adorne that
Strumpet with the Title of a
True Church in this meaning.
But your owne Writings haue
ſo fully cleered you herein;
that Suſpition it ſelfe, cannot
reaoſnably ſuſpect you in this
point. I therefore can ſay no
more concerning your miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
propoſition then this. If in
that treatiſe wherein it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered;
the Antecedents, or
Conſequents were ſuch, as
ſerued fitly to leade the Reader
into that Senſe, which vnder
the word True, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
only Truth of Beeing or
Exiſtencie, and not the Due
Qualities of the thing or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3877:35"/>
you haue beene cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
traduced. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, if that Propoſition
comes in <hi>ex abrupto,</hi> or ſtands
ſolitarie in your diſcourſe, you
cannot maruell though by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the word True according
to the more ordinarie accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
your true meaning was
miſtaken. In briefe, your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
admits a True ſenſe; &amp;
in that ſenſe, is by the beſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in our Reformed Church,
not diſallowed. For The Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Church does principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtand vpon the Gratious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of God, calling men out
of Darkneſſe and Death, vnto
the Participation of ſight and
life in Chriſt Ieſus. So long as
God continues this Calling
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3877:36"/>
vnto any people, though they
(as much as in them lies) Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
this light, and corrupt the
meanes which ſhould bring
them to life and ſaluation in
Chriſt; yet where God Calls
men vnto the Participation of
life in Chriſt, by the word &amp; by
the Sacraments, there is the true
Being of a Chriſtian Church;
let men bee neuer ſo falſe in
their Expoſitions of GODS
Word, or neuer ſo vntruſtie in
mingling their owne Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with Gods Ordinances.
Thus the Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi>
loſt not her Being of a Church,
when ſhee became an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Church. And thus vnder
the gouernment of the Scribes
and Phariſees, who voided the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3877:36"/>
Commandements of God by
their owne Traditions; there
was yet ſtanding a true Church
in which <hi>Zacharias, Elizabeth,</hi>
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
himſelfe was borne, who
were me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of that Church,
and yet participated not in the
corruptions thereof. Thus to
grant that the Roman was, and
is a True Viſible Chriſtian
Church, (though in doctrine a
falſe, and in practice an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Church) is a true aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of greater vſe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
in our Controuerſie
with Papiſts about the Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitie
of the Chriſtian Church,
then is vnderſtood by thoſe
who gainſay it. This in your
Reconciler is ſo wel explicated,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3877:37"/>
as if any ſhall continue in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
you, in regard of that
Propoſition, ſo explained, I
thinke it wil be only thoſe who
are better acquainted with
wrangling, then reaſoning,
and deeper in loue with ſtrife,
then truth: As for the aſperſion
of Arminianiſme, I can teſtifie
that in our Ioint imployment
at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> you were
as farre from it, as my ſelfe. And
I know that no man can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it in the Doctrine of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination,
and Grace, but he
muſt firſt deſert the Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
vpon by the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> nor in the point of
perſeuerance, but he muſt vary
from the common Tenet, and
receiued opinion of our beſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3877:37"/>
approued Doctors in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Church. I am aſſured that
you neither haue deſerted the
one, nor will vary from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And therefore be no more
troubled with other mens
groundleſſe ſuſpitions, then
you would be in like caſe, with
their idle Dreames. Thus I
haue inlarged my ſelfe beyond
my firſt intent. But my loue to
your ſelfe, and the aſſurance of
your conſtant loue vnto the
Truth, inforced me thereunto.

            <p>In the ſecond conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

according to their firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth
to bee led and ruled by
the Word of God. As when
<note n="m" place="margin">Exod 19. 7, 8. Exod. 24. 3, 7.</note> Moſes <hi>laid before the faces of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3877:48"/>

               <hi>Write thou theſe words: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the people,<note n="o" place="margin">Dent. 26. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
this day the Lord to bee thy

and to keepe his Statutes, and his
Commandements, and his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
&amp; to harken vnto his voice:
And the Lord hath auouched thee
this day to be his peculiar people, as
he hath promiſed thee, &amp; that thou
ſhouldeſt keepe all his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
This condition of the
Commandement GOD did
often inclucate into their eares
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3877:49"/>
by his Prophets. As when
hee ſaid to them by <hi>Ieremiah,</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Ier. 7. 23. Ier. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>This thing commanded I them,
ſaying, Obey my voice, and I will
be your God, and yee ſhall bee my

you, that it may bee well vnto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So in the Goſpell, Chriſt
ſaith,<note n="q" place="margin">Iohn 10. 27.</note> 
               <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice,
and I know them, and they follow
me.</hi> But<note n="r" place="margin">Iohn 10. 7.</note> 
               <hi>a ſtranger will they not
follow, but will flie from him: For
they know not the voice of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:</hi>
where he giueth the firſt
marke of the viſibly true and
pure Church, to wit, the pure
preaching, and hearing of
Chriſts voice. As likewiſe Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note n="ſ" place="margin">1. Iohn 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>He that knoweth God
heareth vs: hereby know wee the

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3877:49"/>
errour.</hi> Againe, the Lord ſaith,
<note n="t" place="margin">Iohn 13. 35.</note> 
               <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye
are my Diſciples, if ye haue loue
one to another,</hi> pointing out the
concord and holy agreement
which is among the brethren,
as another marke of the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe
Church: As likewiſe
when hee ſaith,<note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 5. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Let your light
ſo ſhine before men, that they may
ſee your good workes, and glorifie
your Father which is in Heauen,</hi>
hee ſheweth that good workes
are the viſible mark of the true
orthodoxe Church: The true
preaching &amp; reuerent hearing
of the Goſpel, is a viſible mark
of our faith and hope: Our
concord in the Lord, is a marke
of our Charitie: Our good
workes are reall and ſenſible
teſtimonies of our inward
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3877:50"/>
Faith, Hope, and Charitie.
Where wee finde theſe three
ſignes, we know certainly that
there is Chriſts true Church,
and iudge <hi>charitably,</hi> that is
probably, that euery one in
whom wee ſee theſe outward
tokens of Chriſts true and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe
Church, is a true
member of the myſticall body
of the Lord Ieſus. I ſay <hi>charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
becauſe outward markes
may be outwardly counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Hypocrites, as it is ſaid
of Iſrael,<note n="x" place="margin">Pſ. 78. 36. 37.</note> 
               <hi>They did flatter with
their mouth, and they lyed vnto
him with their tongues, for their
heart was not right with him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were they ſtedfaſt in his Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi>
And of many of theſe that
followed our Sauiour,<note n="y" place="margin">Iohn 2. 23. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Many
beleeued in his Name, when they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3877:50"/>
ſaw the miracles which he did: But
Ieſus did not commit himſelfe vnto
them, becauſe he knew all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Iſrael departed from the
Couenant, and by their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
brake, as much as in them
lay, the contract of marriage
betweene them and God, they
ceaſed in that behalfe, to bee

               <hi>Doe not abhorre

               <hi>Thou
art our Father, we are</hi> ALL <hi>thy
people.</hi> For ſo long as God cals
a people to him by his word
and Sacraments, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them with his name: So
long alſo as they conſent to be
called by his name, profeſſing
it outwardly, they remaine his
people, although they anſwere
not his calling, neither in
ſoundneſſe of faith, nor in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
of life. Euen as rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Subiects are ſtill true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
on the Kings behalfe,
who looſeth not his right by

their Rebellion: Nay on their

they ſtill keepe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe

themſelues to any forraine
Prince. Did <hi>Dauid</hi> looſe his
right by the Rebellion of the
people vnder his ſonne <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom!</hi>
And therefore when the
King ſubdueth theſe traitours,
hee carrieth himſelfe towards
them, both in forgiuing and in
puniſhing, as their lawfull and
naturall Prince, and not as a
Conquerour of new Subiects.
So as a ſtrumpet is a true wife,
ſo long as her husband con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
to dwell with her, and
ſhee is named by his name;
And as <hi>Agar</hi> when ſhee fled

               <hi>I flee from the

a true Church, ſo long as God
keeping the right of a King, of

her, giueth her not the bill of
Diuorcement, but conſents
that her Name bee called vpon
her, and ſhee ſtill calleth her

his wife. Thus God calleth the
Iewes <hi>His people,</hi> euen then
when he ſaid they were not his
people, becauſe hee had not
broken the band of marriage
with them, and put them away
by diuorcement. Therefore he
ſaid vnto them,<note n="p" place="margin">Eſa. 50.</note> 
               <hi>Where are the

               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:3877:54"/>
Meaning he had not giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <note n="q" place="margin">Iere. 3. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Thou

to the French tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>I haue the right of an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

called the ten Tribes<note n="r" place="margin">Hoſea 1. 6, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Lo-ruha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,

<hi>asketh counſell at their ſtickes, and

            </p>
            <p>But after that God had ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
them among the <hi>Medes</hi>

and broken his couenant with

               <hi>Plead with your

the Iewes which were Gods
people in the midſt of their id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olatrie,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3877:55"/>
ſince they haue denied
Chriſt to bee the Meſſias, the

the Lord of glory, are no more
Gods people, although they
beg ſtill that name.<note n="u" place="margin">Reuel. 3. 9.</note> 
               <hi>They are,</hi>
ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the Synagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:
They ſay they are Iewes, and

God<note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 11 17.</note> hath broken them off,
and grafted the Gentiles in
their roome, they qualifie
themſelues Gods people as
falſely and iniuriouſly, as a
whoore lawfully diuorced by
her husband, calleth her ſelfe
his wife.</p>
            <p>To applie this to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Church, which hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated
and corrupted the
whole ſeruice of God, and is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3877:55"/>
more adulterous then was at
any time <hi>Iuda</hi> or <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and
therefore is not a true viſible
Church in the ſecond ſence, I
ſay ſhee is one in ſome ſort in
the firſt. In her God doth ſtill
keepe his true word in the Old
and New Teſtament, as the
contract of his marriage with
her. In her is the true Creed,
the true Decalogue, the true
Lords Prayer, which <hi>Luther</hi>
calleth <hi>the kernel of Chriſtianitie:</hi>
In her Chriſt is Preached,
though corruptly. In her the
Trinitie and Incarnation of
Chriſt are beleeued: In her
the Father, the Sonne and the
Holy Ghoſt are prayed vnto,
though in an vnknown tongue
to the moſt part: In her the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
children are Baptiſed in the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3877:56"/>
Name of the Father, of the
Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt.
And no Diuine will denie that
their Baptiſme is a true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby their children
are borne to God, ſeeing wee
doe not rebaptiſe them, where
leauing her, they adioyne
themſelues to vs. Who then
can denie, that ſhee is a true
Church? For out of the Church
there is no Baptiſme, and the
Church alone beareth children
to God. In her ſitteth the man
of ſinne, the ſonne of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who ſitteth<note n="y" place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>in the Temple
of God,</hi> which is the Church.
Its graunted that ſhee is Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
in the ſecond ſence: And
<note n="a" place="margin">Reuel. 18. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Gods people</hi> is commanded to
come out of Babylon. What is
Gods people, but Gods Church
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3877:56"/>
which forſaketh her ſucceſſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as of old the typicall people
came out of the typicall Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
not at once, but at many
ſeuerall times? If then we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
vnto her Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
exhorting her to
come out of Babylon, either
wee vnderſtand not what wee
ſay, or we acknowledge her to
bee Gods people, that is Gods
Church, though idolatrous,
rebellious, and diſobedient:
Neither ſhall ſhee ceaſe to bee
Gods people in this ſence, till
the comming of the bleſſed
day, when the ayre ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with the ſhouting of
the Saints,<note n="b" place="margin">Reuel. 14. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Babylon is fallen,

ſhee made all nations drunke

            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:3877:57"/>
I ſay then, that as <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
was at the ſame time <hi>the holy

was <hi>Bethel and Bethauen,</hi> Gods

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3877:58"/>
ſome on Earth, as the Pope,
ſome in Hell, as <hi>Saint George</hi> an

Butcher of true Chriſtians,
<hi>Saint Dominicke</hi> the firebrand
of the warre againſt the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geois,
Saint Garnet</hi> whom Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne
ſent to his owne place,

Treaſon: Some did

<hi>Saint Christopher, Saint Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
Saint Vrſule, Saint Longin,</hi>
who was a Speare. <hi>Saint Eloi</hi>
who was two couple of ſharpe
nailes, and many more of the
ſame ſtuffe. In a word, the roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Camards of <hi>Bahal</hi>
is ſo lowd in that Church, that
Chriſts voice is ſcant heard in
her, and yet heard both in the

mouth of theſe Babylonian
builders, which vnderſtand

their <hi>Bahal.</hi> And therefore in

            </p>
            <p>This teſtimony is the praiſe

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Aſter <hi>Cholmely,</hi>
I haue peruſed
your learned and
full reply to Maſter <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
anſwere; wherein you
haue in a iudicious eye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
righted your ſelf,
and cleared a iuſt cauſe; ſo,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3877:64"/>
as the Reader would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
where an Aduerſarie
might find ground to raiſe
an oppoſition; But, let me
tell you, Were it a Booke
written by the pen of an
Angeſt from Heauen, in
this ſubiect, I ſhould doubt
whether to wiſh it publique.
How true, how iuſt ſoeuer
the plea be, I find (ſuch is
the ſelfe-loue, and partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of our corrupt nature)
the quarrell is inlarged by
multiplying of words; when
I ſee a fire quenched with
Oyle, I will expect to ſee a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3877:64"/>
controuerſie of this nature,
ſtinted by publike altercati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
New matter ſtill riſes
in the agitation, and giues
hint to a fore-reſolued oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
of a freſh diſquiſition:
So as we may ſooner ſee an
end of the common peace,
then of an vnkindly iarre in
the Church; eſpecially ſuch
a one, as is fomented with a
miſtaken Zeale on the one
ſide, and with a confidence
of knowledge, on the other.
Silence hath ſomtimes quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſuch like miſ-raiſed brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
neuer, interchange of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3877:65"/>
words; This very queſtion
was on foot, ſome fortie
yeares agoe, in the hote
chaſe of great Authors, but,
whether through the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie
of the parties, or ſome
ouer-ruling act of Diuine
Prouidence, it ſoone died,
without noyſe; ſo I wiſh it
may now doe; Rather let
the weaker title goe away
with the laſt word, then the
Church ſhall bee distracted;
For that Poſition of mine,
which occaſioned your vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
you ſee it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
abetted, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3877:65"/>
by ſo reuerend autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
as admits no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I dare ſay; No lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Diuine of our owne
Church, or the foraine, can
but ſubſcribe (in this our
ſenſe) to the iudgement of
theſe Worthies; To draw
forth therefore this cord of
contention to any futher
length, were no leſſe need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
then preiudiciall to
the publike peace; Hee is
not worthy to bee ſatisfied,
that will yet wrangle.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe perſonall
aſperſions that are caſt vpon
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3877:66"/>
you by malice, be perſwaded
to deſpiſe them. Theſe We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne
parts, where your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is deſeruedly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
know your Zeale for
Gods truth no leſſe feruent,
(though better gouerned)
then the most fierie of your
Cenſurers; No man more
hateth Popiſh Superſtition;
only your fault is, that you
doe not more hate errour,
then iniuſtice; and cannot
abide wrong meaſure offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the worst enemie.
Neither bee you troubled
with that idle exprobration
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3877:66"/>
of a Prebendary retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
who would care for a
contumely ſo void of truth?
God knowes that worthleſſe
gift was conferred vpon you,
ere this taske came into ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our thoughts; And
who ſo knowes the entire
reſpects betwixt vs, from
our very cradles, till this
day, may well thinke that
a Prebend of three pounds
by yeare, need not go for a
fee, where there is ſo much,
and ſo ancient cauſe of
deareneſſe: I am ſorrie to
ſee ſuch rancour vnder the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3877:67"/>
cote of Zeale; Surely, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but mere malice can
bee guiltie of this charge;
no leſſe then of that other
enuious challenge of your
decay of graces, of falling
from your firſt loue, from
induſtry to eaſe, from a
weekly, to a Monethly
preaching; When thoſe
that know the ſtate of your
<hi>Tiuerton,</hi> the foure-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
diuiſion of that charge,
and your forced confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to your owne day, by
publique authoritie, both
Spirituall, and Temporall,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3877:67"/>
must needs acquit you, and
cry downe the wrong of an
accuſer; As for the vigour
of Gods good graces in you,
both common, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
all the Countrie are
your ample witneſſes; I that
haue interknowne you from
our childhoods, cannot but
profeſſe to find the entrance
of your age no leſſe aboue
the beſt of your youth in
abilities, then in time; and
ſtill, no leſſe fruitfull in
promiſes; of increaſe, then
in eminent performances.
What need I vrge this?
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3877:68"/>
your Aduerſaries do enough
feele your worth; So as (to
ſpeake ſeriouſly) I cannot
ſufficiently wonder at the
libertie of thoſe men, who
profeſsing a ſtrict conſcience
of their wayes, dare let their
pens, or tongues looſe to ſo
iniurious and vncharitable
detraction, whereof they
know the iuſt auenger is in
Heauen; It ſhould not be
thus betwixt Brethren, no
not with enemies.</p>
            <p>For the mayne buſineſſe;
There wants not confidence
on either ſide; I am appealed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3877:68"/>
to by hoth; an vnmeet Iudge,
conſidering my ſo deepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements.
But, if my vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perage
may ſtand, I award
an eternall ſilence to both
parts; Sit downe in peace,
then, you, and your worthy
ſecond; Whoſe yong ripenes,
and modest and learned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
is worthy of better
intertainment then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
And let your Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Opponents ſay, that
you haue ouer-comne your
ſelues in a reſolued ceſſation
of pens; and them, in a
loue of peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:3877:69"/>
Farewell, from your louing
Friend and ancient Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league.</p>
