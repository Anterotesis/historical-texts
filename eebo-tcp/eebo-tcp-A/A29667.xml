            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The truth is, This Noble Lord (the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this following Discourse) having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved deep in those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Mysteries (at which his first lines glaunce,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.

            <p>That which ravisht his Soule most, and most inforc'd him more to pry, to adore more, Was, the experience of that which <hi>Plato</hi> speaks: <hi>When our Soules</hi> (saith he) <hi>glance first upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light,</hi>

It needs not my Apology; if so, I might truly say, When 'twas first VVrot, 'twas intended but a Letter to

               </p>
               <p>For when the soule by vertue of its Being, is cleare in such a truth, it is said to be an infused habit. When by frequent action, such a truth is connaturall to the soule, it may be stiled an habit acquisite: though indeed all is but light more or lesse glorious, discovering it selfe frequently or rarely, and by divine appointment,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51295:35"/>
at such a conjunction of time, and not any other, not that the soule is infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by its owne action; for what hath the streame which it derives not from the source? What can those workings added to that, from which they receive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
               <p>And therefore I wholly subscribe to the Platonists, who make all <hi>scientia</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>reminiscentia</hi>; for when it appeareth not, it is not; the soule being but an activity, it must be no more than it acteth: and though we seeme by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent actings to helpe the soule, and so to create in it acquisite habits, yet these are but a <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> This is but the way
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51295:35"/>
which God discloseth to our eye, whereas all the actings are onely new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries.</p>
               <p>Our Philosophers affirme thus boldly of the unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, attributing it all to the instinct, or a new influence.</p>
               <p>Why may not, why must not we conclude the same of man, seeing it is a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved truth, that <hi>acti agimus,</hi> and we are in our strength in regard of God no better than the most abject crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>

               <p>But some, it may be, will imagine those Worthies to be endowed with higher gifts of Nature and Art, than S. <hi>Paul:</hi> and then they will give all the glory to <hi>their understanding,</hi> and not to their <hi>affections.</hi>

               <p>If it be so, I confesse I have not fitly chosen my Opposites; But the truth will then appeare in Them, without comparison di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.</p>
               <p>For, if in affection they exceed all, and in abilities are as <hi>Saul,</hi> taller than their brethren by head and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, then is it manifest in them, that eftsoone men of

He saith of himselfe, <hi>I profited in the Iewes religion above many my equalls in my owne nation, being more exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</hi> And after his conversion, he was judged the only man fit to contend with the Philosophers at Athens.

It is he that disputes about meates, long haire, divorces, irregular partings of husband and wife.

is content not onely to bee bound, but to die for Christ.</p>
               <p>Good Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was so tender over his kinsmen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the flesh, that for their sakes he could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be content to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the love of the Lord Jesus Christ. And this is greater love than that which Christ mentioneth; for no man had then shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed greater love than to die; but this holy Saint will goe one step further, he will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an eternall death for his friend.</p>
               <p>Thus, if suffering either for the head, or members, for the Church, or Christ, will discover affection, I suppose hee will merit the Garland.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:51295:51"/>And as a complement and crowne of all, if to live be most for Gods glory, though death be his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, he is resolved to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, making obedience to Christ in life and death, his gaine and triumph.</p>
               <p>I confesse, when he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velleth through those brie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry disputes, he cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play such sparkling vivid affections: But when hee hath gotten but a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove those lime-twigs, how doth he mount on high, and there, upon even wings, disdaine all things below, triumphing in the imbraces of his Saviour, who is to him more choice than the choicest of ten thousand?</p>
               <p>If what I have attempted to prove, be true, as I hope

               <p>And lastly, that all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is but the <hi>Truth,</hi> that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ray of heavenly light which God is pleased

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51295:54"/>
If it be such, how differs it from thought, ratiocination or positions in the minde?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity which is the form of the soul, not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the actions thereof.</note>Whilst then these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, sayings, actions, are the forme of that truth, of that universall first truth, they must be that truth.

               <p>If the forme of this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity be not these reasonable workings, it must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either of a baser allay, or of a higher stamp.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Not of a higher straine.</note>If the latter; then you speak of Angels or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spiritual Being, if there be any which is more noble than the soule. And then
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51295:54"/>
how doth this excellency discover it selfe? Where or what is it? How is it said that Action is the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things?</p>
               <p>If the former;<note place="margin">Nor of a lower.</note> then <hi>first</hi> you descend to some lower degree of existency; for, all Being is but an activity; and according to the glory or basenesse of that activity, doth the Being receive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination.</p>

               <p>But they who approve of the distinction of <hi>actus pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>actus secundus,</hi> think
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51295:55"/>
they salve all by the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of substance and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; So, with them, <hi>actus primus</hi> is the Being, the substance it selfe: and <hi>actus secundus</hi> is the product of that Being or accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that which they make a soule; and thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting this, that <hi>omnis vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus consistit in actione,</hi> they make the soule a meere vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Being.</p>

               <p>What is this their <hi>actus primus?</hi> What is the forme of it? What is with them the forme of a reasonable soule?</p>
               <p>Is not Reason? can there then be a soule, till there be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51295:55"/>
reason? And this Reason is not <hi>potentia ratiocinandi,</hi> but <hi>Ratio.</hi> For, if you distinguish between the act and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the act must ever be first in order, dignity, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>So then, What is the form of this <hi>primus actus?</hi> is not some act? if it be, it must exist; else you will allow it but a bare notionall Being, which lyeth in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension. And if it doth exist, must it not be this which you call <hi>actus secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be not an act, they make it nothing but a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a faculty depending upon something else. And if this be the nature of the first, what can the second Being (which is the effect, and so
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51295:56"/>
lower) be, but a bare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

               <p>But the activity consisting in the action, That and It shall both be proved but one; and so, <hi>actus primus</hi> and <hi>actus secundus</hi> are this same <hi>truth,</hi> this light which I plead for.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. An objection answered, in which the nature of Time and Place are touched.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Et this doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly stumble mens thoughts; wee see various actings of the soule, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Time and Place; there are severall distinct actings; are there then so many severall soules?</p>
               <p>First, I could justly give this answer; When these men can tell me what <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> is, I doe hope I shall finde both time and place to dissolve the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:51295:57"/>Secondly, I shall, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, both by reason and their owne assertions in the like case, prove that <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> are nothing, or alter nothing in this point; and that, these <hi>simile's</hi> will a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle irradiate.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Beauty il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrating time and place.</note>Beauty (if I bring not the exact discription of the learned, yet I shall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber so much as concerneth the point in hand) consists in complexion, in linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in harmony.</p>
               <p>Complexion draweth his Being from colour, from the subject wherein colour is seated, the spirits which give a Being to this colour, &amp;c. and these are differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by many circumstances. Lineaments as they are adorned by, so are they the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51295:57"/>
ornaments of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. And these againe are divers from themselves, and divers from Harmony. And yet, by Harmony, these make up one sweet, one pleasant Being, which we call Beauty.</p>
               <p>A Flame rising from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thornes, is not many, is but one flame. A streame filled with various springs, is not various, is but one streame. So is it in our case.</p>
               <p>Those Circumstances of time and place, differencing these various Beings, are something, or nothing.</p>
               <p>If nothing, the objection is answered.</p>
               <p>If something, they are a piece of the whole, they serve to make up that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51295:58"/>
which we call Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Thus time and place, with all Beings of the like nature, are either nothing, or else they have a share in the Being, and make up the <hi>totum Compositum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Time and Place no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the essence of the soul.</note>The Soule is but one Act distinguished to our noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by severall apparitions; and these intervals, with all variations, either are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or are of the nature of the Soule, and serve to make up that confort, that truth, that life that we now discourse of.</p>
               <p>And that this is so, I hope by this cleere ratiocination to leave you assured.</p>
               <p>Time and Place seeme to me nothing but an extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call modification of a thing. I cannot finde that the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

have made anything at all of them. Let us survey them, as they define them, when they treat of them; as they esteeme them, when they meete them occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>

The first having received from some higher power a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51295:59"/>
wherein in was this hard word, <hi>Invasion,</hi> repaired to his Rabbi for Solution: he, that the question might seeme somewhat obscure, paused a little, that it might not shame him; after he had consulted, in a stroke or two with his grave-learned beard, replyed; the sense of this word is very plaine, it is <hi>Invasion,</hi> it signifieth <hi>Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>; with which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable being fully satisfied, gave him many thankes and departed. <hi>Locus</hi> and <hi>spatium corporis locati,</hi> is little better; what have we in this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the intrinsecall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of place? So that, if I be not wholly blinde, they, whilst they treat of it as Scholars, make it nothing: when they make use of it by
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51295:59"/>
the By, it is the same. As, the Soule, they say, is <hi>tota in toto,</hi> and <hi>tota in qualibet parte</hi>; whilst they spread and diffuse the soule over the whole body, from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity to the other, <hi>Place</hi> maketh no division in the soule; it is but one soule, yet extended quite through the body. Angels are <hi>defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè in loco</hi>; that place which is within the circumference so limited, doth not at all cause them to make two in this angelicall Being.</p>
               <p>I may affirme the same of time,<note place="margin">Time.</note> 
                  <hi>Tempus est mensura mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>; What doe I know of time by this? how can I from hence ghesse time to have so considerable a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as that it shall make two of that whith other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51295:60"/>
would be but one? In the Deity we are sure it can have no such effect. In the Deity wee have creation, preservation, redemption, decree, and execution of that decree. All these to our apprehension are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by time: and yet no man will say, that in God they are two: for God is <hi>purus actus, nulla poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will say, this is <hi>obscurum per obscurius,</hi> and not to unmask and unveile difficulties: Which no <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile</hi> taken from the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity can doe, because That is all mysticall.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, <hi>Si magnis licet componere parva,</hi> wee shall finde the same in our selves, we shall find that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51295:60"/>
Time doth not at all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or any way act. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it is cleare, that Place hath lost all place and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in this argumentation. Why may not I say the same of Time, seeing by all mens confessions they are twins of the same womb? But secondly, I affirme this, (and I hope truly) that if you make Time any thing,<note place="margin">All actions nothing, if time be any thing.</note> you annihilate all the act of the Creation; that is, you will admit of no one perfect action. A thought, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, passeth in a moment; and yet, in this moment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this moment, are many subdivisions of Time. We have in an houre, an halfe, a quarter, a minute, a second, (the 60 part of a minute:) &amp; how many subdivisions will
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51295:61"/>
a scruple admit of? For ought I know, Time and <hi>punctum Physicum</hi> agree in this, that they are <hi>divisibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia in insinitum.</hi> If then you will make so many thoughts in a thought, as you have divisions under a scruple, you will have no perfect thought, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat act. To shun this, you wil confesse that Time doth not divide one act alone: but one Act or thought compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth many Times. Why may not I say, that if Time doth not parcell out one act, it cannot act upon two, when the duality ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth onely from Time? This not being well weighed, hath cast our wits upon strange rocks, hath raised this Question,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:51295:61"/>
                  <hi>How doth God see things?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, how God seeth things.</note> If in their existencies, then all things are co-eternall with God: if in their Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses onely, then all things are not present with God; but you must admit of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, a former and a lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to eye divine; which is blasphemy. This <hi>dilemma</hi> seemeth strong; but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we make Time some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: whereas indeed all things did exist in their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with God <hi>ab omni aeterno.</hi> For, <hi>aeternum &amp; tempus</hi> are all one in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and this successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is but to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.</p>
               <p>Thus, if Time and Place be nothing, I hope the weight of this objection is is taken off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:51295:62"/>But I foresee another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I fully conclude with <hi>Aristotles</hi> Adversaries <hi>Anaxagoras, Democritus, &amp;c</hi> That Contradictions may be <hi>simul &amp; semel</hi> in the same Subject, same Instant, same Notion (not onely in two distinct respects, or notions, as one thing may be <hi>causa &amp; effectum, Pater &amp; Filius, respectu diversi</hi>; but even in the same respect, under one and the same Notion.) For, <hi>Non ens</hi> is nothing; and so, the Being which it hath, may subsist with that which contradicts it. I speake in their termes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:51295:62"/>Now, let us view our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either</p>

               <p>As many; impute Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression to what you please, either to the effects in the body, or the Will, and its workings: all these, so farre as they have Being, are good; for, all Being is good. Where then is the sinne? Certainly, sinne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this, that there is not so full a goodnesse as there should. Sin is onely a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, a Non-Entity: But, a Privation, a Non-Entity may subsist (according to the subsistence it hath) with Being. Such a co-existence of Entity and Non-Entity, was in his faith, who cried, <hi>Lord, I beleeve, help my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</hi>

This Contradiction (of Entity, Non-Entity) must be in the selfe-same Act, (and not in two distinct Acts:) else the Act is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, (having complete En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, goodnesse, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of Non-Entity:) and <hi>so</hi> is onely the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: or else it is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect than <hi>Beelzebub</hi>; for, It is Bad, and no Good, Non-Entity wholly, and no Entity, and <hi>so</hi> no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Thus we see Good and Evill may co-exist in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, in particular Actions; Why then <hi>not so,</hi> if all Acts should bee but one entire Act, undistinguisht by Time or Place? If the members composing the Body, have matter and forme, why then

               <p>In this action, there are two things; There is the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Being, and the seeing it under a confused notion. Or, which is the same,</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have in a word showne how Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty untyeth all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, unites all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in <hi>practicall</hi> things.

               <p>
                  <hi>Tully</hi> saith of <hi>Epicurus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding knowledg into many Sciences.</note> 
                  <hi>Frangit, non dividit</hi>; The breaking of learning into so many Sciences, is but making so many miles, that so the Master may have more hire for his post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51295:74"/>
They forget, that, <hi>vita est brevis,</hi> whilst <hi>ars est longae.</hi> It were much better if all Learning were like the chaine fastned at <hi>Iupiters</hi> Throne, all of a piece: Or the Beame, which from the Sunne by a continuall tract of irradiation toucheth the treasures of the earth.</p>
               <p>To the effecting of this, that learned, that mighty man <hi>Comenius</hi> doth happily and rationally indeavour to reduce <hi>all</hi> into <hi>one.</hi> Why doe wee make Philosophy and Divinity two Sciences? What is True Philosophy but Divinity? and if it be not True, it is not Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from division in knowledg.</note>Doe but see a little in particulars, the fruit of such like divisions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:51295:74"/>In the knowledge of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, we must observe</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Knowledg double, of Beings, &amp; of their Causes.</note> Being is:</p>
               <p>Secondly, What it is.</p>
               <p>There is the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. What a tedious work doth this very division lay upon us?<note place="margin">Knowledg of Beings twofold, of their existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> Alas, the very first, the easiest part of it, will take up all our time; and to ascend to causes before we know that there are effects, is to mount the highest round, before we ascend the first. And therefore that learned wit, Sir <hi>Francis Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> in his naturall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, bringeth onely experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, leaving the search of causes to those, who are content, with <hi>Icarus,</hi> to burne their wings at a fire too hot for them. Indeed, sometimes as an imbellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51295:75"/>
of his discourse, that he may please stirring fancy, he interlaceth some causes, yet gently and modestly propoundeth them, but as for entertainment. If now our humble spirits could be content to see all things, as they are, but one, onely bearing different shapes, we should according to that rule, <hi>Noli altum sapere,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in what we know, and there sit downe. But our spirits are mighty <hi>Nimrods,</hi> hunting after knowledge, venturing all, to eate of the tree of knowledge of good and evill. Which curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ours, is wittily repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Sir <hi>Iohn Davies</hi>;
<q>
                     <l>Why did my Parents send me to the Schooles,</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:51295:75"/>That I with knowledg might enrich my minde:</l>
                     <l>When the desire to know, first made men fooles.</l>
                     <l>And did corrupt the root of all mankinde.</l>
                  </q>
And for this reason we lose with <hi>Esops</hi> Dog, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and get not the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
               <p>Causes we cannot,<note place="margin">Knowledg of existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, but altogether uncertain.</note> neither shall ever finde out: The knowledg of existencies we omit; they are too volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, if we did attempt; and so much doubted of by men, that what to think, we know not. View all Learning, and see how the very Being of things, is questioned in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Philosophy. Amongst the <hi>Quadrupedes,</hi> wee que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the existence of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51295:76"/>
Unicorne: <hi>inter volatilia,</hi> the Phoenix, and the Bird of Paradise: amongst <hi>Fishes,</hi> the Mer-maid. When we seek into <hi>Minerals,</hi> we finde not <hi>Ebur fossile</hi>; the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable vertues of it wee meet with in all Physicians: but the subject of so many excellencies, we doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope for. Of <hi>herbes</hi> and <hi>plants,</hi> Bookes name many which gardens, meadowes, rivers afford not: If they ever were, we may give them to <hi>Pancirolla,</hi> that he may reckon them with <hi>perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um mobile,</hi> the Philosophers stone, <hi>cum multis alijs, inter Inventa perdita:</hi> For every age interreth old things, and is againe fertile of new births.</p>
               <p>If we were mighty men,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51295:76"/>
as <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Knowledg of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures more uncertain than the existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> that all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would come and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselves to our view: yet (which is the second part of this first Question) wee could not give them their names according to their natures. For when we doe know that any Being doth exist, we doe not know what their formes, their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall qualities and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raments are. We altogether are ignorant of herbes and plants; which are hot and cold, in how many degrees they are so. For in these, how many, how eternall are the debates? Some deny the healing vertue to <hi>Dictam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> Some question the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that killing-saving Indian herb, Hen-man-bane, <hi>Tobacco</hi>: whose insolence is

               <p>Thus you see in what a Maze you are Meandred,<note place="margin">In what sense Knowledg of Beings is to be wished.</note> if you admit of any divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

so we keepe our selves still to this principle, that those things are all of one nature, variegated only in our apprehension: and this knowledge I must consent to.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F wee are thus at a stand, in these very beginnings, what shall wee bee, when wee enquire after Causes? <hi>Two</hi> lie open to our view.<note place="margin">Two only causes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, God, and emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God.</note> 
                  <hi>First,</hi> our great and good <hi>God,</hi> the fountaine of all Being, and this the Ancients styled <hi>Fatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manation</hi> from him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aristotles materia prima</hi> brought to light.</note> which is the first created cause of all Being, and this was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle's materia prima,</hi> so far as sensible things extend.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51295:79"/>
Which because it is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all things, and the variations of it make all <hi>formes</hi>; therefore in it selfe, he described it to be neither <hi>quid, quale,</hi> nor <hi>quantum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All other causes are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowne by name, than in the natures of them. They make many, as <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, Finall, Materiall, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall</hi>; with divers subdistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; as instrumental, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary, &amp;c. All these have matter and forme.<note place="margin">Matter &amp; Forme have their matter and forme, both of which meet in the ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> For, there is a matter, and forme of a materiall cause, and forme and matter of formall causes. For in a table of of wood, the materiall cause is not the matter, wood: wood is the subject, upon which this materiall cause bringeth forth that effect,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51295:79"/>
a Table. It may bee the materiall cause shall not be Physicall matter; wee shall by and by finde it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name.</p>
               <p>Of the forme of a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall cause, I shall say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and so for formall causes.</p>
               <p>Faith is said to be the forme of a Christian, and faith hath its forme. The soule is by many deemed (which I understand not) the forme of the reasonable creature, and it hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular individuall forme. And thus both materiall and formall causes have matter and forme.</p>
               <p>Matter againe, is either <hi>Physicall</hi> and substantiall, or metaphoricall and <hi>metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall.</hi> And this is the name
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51295:80"/>
I promised even now.</p>
               <p>Formes are either intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secall, or extrinsecall: the intrinsecall are Logicall, Metaphysicall, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now have you various and severall kinds of forms; but who knoweth the least considerable part of matter or forme? Who will not cleerly lose himselfe in such an inquest? May we not say of these, what one saith wittily of the Soule?</p>

               <p>I doe seeme (if I mistake not) to maintaine this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition by an evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, thus;</p>

               <p>Yet, that Truths may come more cleerely and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily to our apprehension, I shall allow the use of the distinction, so that they improve it only for <hi>memory,</hi> and doe not expectany <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> from it.</p>

               <p>But God considering that we are lower than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (and them hee hath charged with folly;<note place="margin">The inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note>) that we are infirme; that we cannot alwayes keep the bow bent: If we cannot be holy all the weeke, if we cannot be pure at our own Tables; as who
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51295:97"/>
can? yet, if we will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Sabbath, and if wee will come to that feast of marrow and fatnesse with a wedding-garment, and at other times doe our best (though weak) indeavours, he will behold no iniquity in us.</p>
               <p>We shall not be perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed, how farre we ought to mourne for the sinnes of others, the sinnes of the times, or our owne lives. [And these are intangling questions to many sweet spirits.] For, drawing all things to an unity, we shall know that sorrow and joy may meet in the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at once;<note place="margin">Mourning and joy reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> they must be both in the actings of faith. Wee must not sorrow as without hope; We may not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51295:97"/>
lose our Faith in our teares; Our teares must be teares of joy; Wee may think, that we have sinned, and so sigh; but at the same instant, wee must know we have a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and so triumph. And if I were now all gore blood, would I not now goe to the Chirurgians? Truly the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my sin, the sooner ought to be my return, the higher my Faith. But great and inlarged Faith, cannot be without exultation and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificats.</p>
               <p>Thus could we lay aside foolish questions, could we seek into our hearts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Poets advice, <hi>Ne te quaesiveris extra,</hi> and not into the causes, and the Being of causes, things too high for us; We might have
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51295:98"/>
an Heaven here, we might see how Christ is one with GOD, and wee one with Christ; so wee in Christ, one with God.</p>
               <p>If wee cannot reach the perfection of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet let us come as neere it as we can, for the true knowledge of God in Christ, is life everlasting. ⸪</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND now, Sir, I have with what brevity I can, run through, what I never intended to speake of. I had prepared a little in lieu of This, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nature of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> which I now shall reserve for a Discourse upon the fourteenth Chapter of the second to Corinth: But it was with me in this case, as it is with the soule, prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it selfe at the throne of grace. It designes to breath it selfe out in confession, but is suddenly raised up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51295:99"/>
to sweet exultation. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a <hi>Magnificat,</hi> but by some unexpected irresistible power, it is dissolved into teares; which never did, nor ever can happen in a <hi>Forme,</hi> as might appeare by ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the opposit arguments, if opportunity prevailed as well as reason.</p>
            <p>I had nothing in my reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, but, by a word or two, to mediate in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of these lines, a free and a friendly accesse, to Your more serious and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full studies. But (<hi>quo fato nescio</hi>) I have let fall my plummet into waters too deepe, that if you lend not your favourable constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the perusall, I must suffer. I confesse my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in your Gentlenesse is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51295:99"/>
great; I shall therefore, without any further plea, after this long Parenthesis, give you a short accompt of what these papers beare.</p>
            <p>You have here my poore thoughts upon the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourth Chap. of <hi>Matth.</hi> that I was forced to, because I quote it, more than once, in sense differing from our Commentators: yea, I was necessitated to run through the whole Chapter. It will appeare in costly robes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with lofty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious language, sweetned by many a pleasant and cleare Simile, quickned by divers acute and learned Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cismes: <hi>These, none of these are mine:</hi> My Cabinet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shrineth no such Treasure. I confesse, to save the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51295:100"/>
of contending with <hi>Pareus,</hi> and others, I delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Friend of Yours, and Mine, onely the <hi>substra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> of the Discourse, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, from those prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to undertake my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. In lieu of this, he returned me the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 24</note>, imbellished with so much wit and learning, that I durst not call it mine, and so thought to have suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it; and Had done so, but that from the Law of friendship, you may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a share in what is His; and from that reason it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth now, and is presented to Your view, hoping (for his sake, not for mine) to finde grace in your eyes.</p>
            <p>You have also, my Thoughts, upon the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51295:100"/>
of <hi>Revelations,</hi> because therein I have done Two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> According to my Modell, answered your three <hi>Quaeries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               </note> Discovered my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concerning the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenaries.</hi> I finde That point entertained by many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and pious men, under various and different noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> who were of <hi>that opinion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The first too ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> lived immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as <hi>Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Irenaeus,</hi> and so on; in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages, <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine, cum multis alijs:</hi> these men did a little <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranize</hi>; for, with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> they cast all the glory of it, into the outward pomp the Church should then enjoy:
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51295:101"/>
which is but as the body of that other spirituall beauty, wherein the Church of God shall at that time be more than exceedingly resplendent. Yet these men have happily fixed upon the due Season, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting them at the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of the <hi>seventh Vial,</hi> a thousand yeares before the end of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond only Spirituall.</note>Of latter dayes, most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and glorious Lights, as <hi>Calvin, Beza, Iunius, Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius, Broughton, &amp;c.</hi> have wrapt up all the glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>spirituall notion,</hi> rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing both it and other Scriptures, of that sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; whereon even <hi>Our</hi> Soules, but especially <hi>Our children</hi> shall feed as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Marrow and Fatnesse;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51295:101"/>
wherewith we shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed as with Wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined upon the lees. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries</hi> may sometimes (in some sense) be <hi>Errors</hi>; the <hi>others</hi> erred because they have not the <hi>spirituall</hi>; and <hi>these</hi> have mistaken, not observing the <hi>temporall</hi> glory of this thousand yeares.</p>
            <p>These last men are suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a generation of Worthies,<note place="margin">A third sort, in some things too literall.</note> who have come nearer to the Truth; yet (if I mistake not) have missed it; and some of these are <hi>Alstedius,</hi> (who justly meriteth the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram of <hi>Sedulitas</hi>) <hi>Mede,</hi> and some others; who indeed expect a time of glory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing the first men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they made theirs too
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51295:102"/>
carnall. Yet doe they faile themselves, by placing the time after the burning of the world with materiall fire, spoken of in <hi>Peter</hi>; and joyning with it their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, of the resurrection of the Martyrs, which I do not wholly condemne, though therein I am not yet so cleere.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend man Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> against whom I will not now dispute, whose opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, seeing I must oppose it, when I mention it, I will not now name. For hee ought always <hi>à me non sine honore nominari. Pliny</hi> saith <hi>Venerabilis Catonis' e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietas,</hi> and so say I of <hi>Brightman,</hi> The very <hi>Errors</hi> (if errors) of <hi>Brightman</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:51295:102"/>
have their <hi>beauty</hi>: I must confesse, if God hath been pleased to discover light to me, I have borrowed from him. If there be any thing of sweet, I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered it from the strong. And I do seriously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test I have not with <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> the Souldier; underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Cardan,</hi> that his ruines may be my rise.</p>
            <p>No, no, I honour his very Urne, and do beleeve that one day I shall see the Jews very zealous in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to him some stately <hi>Mausoleum,</hi> who hath been the first meanes of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the affections of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to pray for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>
            <p>Sir, I have overtired your Gentlenesse, and your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51295:103"/>
therefore now give me leave to refresh your spirits; Let me in a word say here, what I prove more amply elsewhere; the days are at hand; We shall see the Laying of the <hi>first stone,</hi> if not the rearing of the structure to some good height.</p>
            <p>I know there is a Great Reader, who, though hee hath <hi>Lynx</hi> his eyes, yet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing overmuch the Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agenary Spectacles of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Antiquity, loseth to himselfe, and, by his justly-merited authority, robbeth others of, this sweet truth, of the Church her appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching glory, which is in my apprehension, as <hi>blood</hi> to the veines, as <hi>life</hi> to the blood, as <hi>spirit</hi> to the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51295:103"/>
life, as <hi>all</hi> to the Spirit. But certainly, while he thinketh the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> to be yet unburied, hee doth bury two witnesses, which are as able to bring Christ to his Espousals, as the two post-knights were to naile him to the Crosse.</p>
            <p>I know there is another worthy, who hath for many yeares stayed Christs saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spouse with flagons of Generous and Good Wine, who adjourneth our happinesse by expecting the sad downfull of the two <hi>Witnesses.</hi> But (as I have, I hope, cleerely proved elsewhere) That is past. <hi>Macte ergo gaudio,</hi> Tune up your ten-stringed instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Let us heare that pleasant melody of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51295:104"/>
Hymen; <hi>O Hymenaee!</hi> Let Your sweet spirit sing, and We will dance: For certainly ere long, all teares shall be wiped away from our eyes, and perfect frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Love</hi> will cast out <hi>Feare.</hi>
