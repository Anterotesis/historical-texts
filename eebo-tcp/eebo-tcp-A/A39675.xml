         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The study and knowledge of the <hi>Soul</hi> was therefore always reckoned a rich and necessary improvement of time. All Ages have mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified these two words, <hi>know thy self,</hi> as an <hi>Oracle</hi> descending from Heaven.</p>
            <p>No knowledge, saith <hi>Bernard,</hi> is better than that whereby we know our selves: leave other matters therefore, and search thy self; run

through thy self; make a stand in thy self; let thy thoughts, as it were, circulate, begin and end in thy self. Strain not thy thoughts in vain about other things, thy self being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
            <p>The study and knowledge of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> must still be allow'd to be most excellent and necessary: But yet the Worth of Necessity of <hi>Christ,</hi> is unknown to Men, till the value, wants, and dangers of their own <hi>Souls</hi> be first discovered to them.</p>
            <p>The disaffectedness and aversation of men to the study of their own Souls, is the more to be admired; not only because of the weight and necessity of it, but the alluring pleasure and sweetness that is found therein. What <note n="*" place="margin">

of, and designations for a better life than that it now lives in the Body, and that we shall not cease to <hi>bee,</hi> when we cease to <hi>breathe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly, my Friends, Discourses of the Soul and its immortality; of <hi>Heaven</hi> and of <hi>Hell,</hi> the next and only receptacles of unbodied Spirits, were never more seasonable and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary than in this Atheistical age of the World, wherein all serious piety and thoughts of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality are ridicul'd, and hissed out of the company of many: As if those old condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Hereticks</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> who asserted the corruptibility and mortality of the Soul as well as Body, had been again revived in our days.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Atheism</hi> of some, so the <hi>tepidity</hi> and unconcerned carelessness of the most needs and calls for such potent Remedies as Discourses of this kind do plentifully afford. I dare appeal to your charitable Judgments, whether the Conversations and Discourses of the <hi>Many,</hi> do indeed look like a serious <hi>pursuit</hi> of Heaven, and a <hi>flight</hi> from Hell?</p>
            <p>Long have my thoughts bended towards this great and excellent <hi>Subject,</hi> and many earnest desires I have had, (as I believe all thinking persons must needs have) to know

what I shall be when I breathe not. But when I had engaged my Meditations about it, two great rubs opposed the farther progress of my thoughts therein: Namely,

            <p>And yet I know mens labours prosper not according to the art and elegancy of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure, but according to the divine blessing which pleaseth to accompany them. <hi>Ruffinus</hi>

            </p>
            <p>O that my weak endeavours might prosper under the like influence of the Spirit upon the hearts of them that shall read this inartificial, but well-meant Discourse.</p>
            <p>I am little concerned about the Contempts and Censures of fastidious Readers. I have resolved to say nothing that exceeds Sobriety, nor to provoke any man, except my dissent from his unproved Dictates must be his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</p>
            <p>Perhaps there are some doubts and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties relating to this Subject, which will never be fully solved till we come to Heaven. For Man by the Fall being less than himself, doth not understand himself, nor will ever perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly do so, until he be fully restored to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; which will not be whilst he dwells in a
<pb facs="tcp:63760:5"/>
Body of sin and death. And yet it is to me past doubt, that this as well as other Subjects might have been much more cleared than it is, if instead of the proud Contendings of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly Wits for Victory, all had humbly and peaceably applied themselves to the impartial search of truth.</p>
            <p>Truth like an Orient Pearl in the bottom of a River would have discovered it self by its native lustre and radiancy, had not the feet of Heathen <hi>Philosophers,</hi> cunning <hi>Atheists,</hi> and daring School <hi>Divines</hi> disturbed and foul'd the stream.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as the difficulties of the Subject are many, so many have been the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and Avocations I have met with whilst it was under my hand: Which I mention for no other end but to procure a more favourable Censure from you, if it appear less exact than you expected to find it. Such as it is I do with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and affection, tender it to your hands, humbly requesting the blessing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may accompany it to your hearts. If you will but allow your selves to think close to the matter before you, I doubt not but
<pb facs="tcp:63760:6"/>
you may find somewhat in it apt both to inform your minds, and quicken your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. I know you have a multiplicity of business under your hands, but yet I hope your great concern makes all others daily to give place, and that how clamorous and importunate soever the Affairs of this World be, you both can and do find time to sit alone and bethink your selves of a much more important business you have to do.</p>
            <p>My Friends, we are Borderers upon Eternity; we live upon the Confines of the Spiritual and Immaterial World. We must shortly be associated with bodyless Beings, and shall have (after a few days are past) no more concerns for Meat, Drink, and Sleep, buying and selling, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations and Relations, than the Angels of God now have. Beside, we live here in a State of Tryal. Man (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls him) is <hi>Utriusque Mundi nexus,</hi> one in whom both Worlds do meet, his Body participates of the lower, his Soul of the upper World. Hence it is he finds such tugging and pulling, this way, and that way; upward, and downward; both Worlds
<pb facs="tcp:63760:6"/>
as it were contending for this invaluable prize, the precious Soul. All Christs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are instituted, and his Officers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for no other use or end, but the Salvation of Souls: Books are valuable according to their Conducibility to this end. How rich a Reward of my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours shall I account it, if this Treatise of the Soul, may but promote the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and Salvation of any Readers Soul!</p>
            <p>To your hands I first tender it. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes your Property, not only as a Debt of Justice, the fulfilling of a Promise made you long since upon your joynt and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desires for the publication of it; but as an acknowledgment of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Favours I have received from you, to one of you I stand obliged in the Bond of Relation, and under the sense of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kindnesses, beyond whatever such a degree of Relation can be supposed to exact.</p>
            <p>You have here a succinct account of the Nature, Faculties, and Original of the Soul of Man, as also of its infusion into the
<pb facs="tcp:63760:7"/>
Body by God, without intitling himself to the guilt and sin resulting from that their Union.</p>
            <p>You will also find the breath of your Nostrils to be the <hi>Nexus, Tie,</hi> or <hi>Bond,</hi> which holds your Souls and Bodies in a personal Union; and that whilst the due Crasis and Temperament of the Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and Breath continues; your Souls hang as by a weak and slender thread, over the state of a vast Eternity in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or in Hell: Which will inform you both of the value of your breath, and the best way of improving it, whilst you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it.</p>
            <p>The Immortality of the Soul is here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, proved, and vindicated from the most considerable Objections, so that it will evidently appear to you, by this Discourse, you do not cease to <hi>be,</hi> when you cease to <hi>breathe</hi>: And seeing they will over-live all Temporal Enjoyments, they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily perish, as to all their Joys, Comforts, and Hopes, (which is all the Death that can be incident to an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<pb facs="tcp:63760:7"/>
Spirit) if they be not in the proper sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son secured and provided of that never-peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing food of Souls, God in Christ, their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever.</p>
            <p>Here you will find the Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of that strong inclination which you all feel them to have to your Bodies, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity (notwithstanding that) of their divorce and separation from their beloved Bodies; and that it would manifestly be to their prejudice if it should be otherwise. And to overcome the unreasonable Aversations of Believers, and bring them to a more becoming chearful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Laws of death, whensoever the Writ of Ejection shall be served upon them: You will here find a representation of that blessed life, comely order, and most delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful employment of the incorporeal People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the City of God; wherein, beside those sweet Meditations which are proper to feast your hungry <hi>affections</hi>; you will meet with divers unusual, though not vain or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>useful Questions stated and resolved; which will be a grateful entertainment to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive and <hi>searching minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis possible they may be censured by some as undeterminable and unprofitable <hi>Curiosities</hi>; but as I hate a presumptious intrusion into <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed
<pb facs="tcp:63760:8"/>
Secrets,</hi> so I think it a weakness to be discouraged in the search of truth so far as it is fit to trace it, by such damping and causeless Censures. Nor am I sensible I have in any thing transgressed the bounds of Christian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, to gratifie the Palate of a nice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Reader.</p>
            <p>I have also here set before the Reader an <hi>Idea</hi> or representation of the state and case of damned Souls, that if it be the Will of God, a seasonable discovery of Hell may be the means of some mens recovery out of the danger of it, and closed up the whole with a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the invaluable preciousness of Souls, and the several dangerous snares and artifices of <hi>Satan</hi> their professed Enemy to destroy and cast them away for ever.</p>
            <p>This is the design and general scope of the whole, and of the principal parts of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, and Oh that God would grant me my hearts desire on your behalf in the perusal of it! Even that it may prove a sanctified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument in his hand both to prepare you for, and bring you in love with the unbodied life to make you look with pleasure into your Graves, and die by consent of <hi>Will,</hi> as well as necessity of <hi>Nature.</hi> I remember Dr. <hi>Staughton</hi> in a Sermon preached before <hi>King Iames,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
<pb facs="tcp:63760:8"/>
a strange Story of a little Child in a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack fast asleep upon its Mothers lap as she sate upon a piece of the Wrack amidst the Waves; the Child being awaked with the noise, asked the Mother what those things were, she told it they were drowning Waves to swallow them up, the Child with a pretty smiling Countenance, beg'd a stroke from its <hi>Mother</hi> to beat away those naughty <hi>Waves,</hi> and chid them as if they had been its <hi>Play-mates.</hi> Death will shortly Shipwrack your Bodies, your Souls will sit upon your lips, ready to expire, as they upon the Wrack ready to go down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Would it not be a comfortable and most becoming frame of mind to sit there with as little dread as this little One did among the terrible Waves. Surely if our Faith had but first united us with Christ, and then loosed our hearts off from this inchanting and ensnaring World, we might make a fair step towards this most desireable temper: but unbelief and earthly mindedness make us loth to venture.</p>
            <p>I blush to think what bold adventures those men made, who upon the Contemplation of the Properties of a despicable stone first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured quite out of sight of Land under its conduct and direction, and securely trusted both their Lives and Estates to it, when all the
<pb facs="tcp:63760:9"/>
eyes of Heaven were vail'd from them, amid'st the dark Waters, and thick Clouds of the Sky; when I either start, or at least give an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling shrug, when I think of adventuring out of sight of this World under the more sure and steady direction and conduct of Faith and the Promises. To cure these evils in my own and the Readers heart, these things are written, and in much respect and love tendered to your hands, as a Testimony of my Gratitude, and deep sense of the many Obligations you have put me under. That the Blessings of the Spirit may accompany these Discourses to your Souls, afford you some assistance in your last and difficult work of putting them off at death with a becoming chearfulness, saying in that hour, Can I not see God till this Flesh be laid aside in the Grave: Must I die before I can live like my self? Then die my Body and go to thy dust, that I may be with Christ. With this design, and with these hearty Wishes, dear and honoured Cousin, and worthy Friends, I put these Discourses into your hands, and remain</p>

               <hi>Sentiments</hi> and impressions of the World to come, and the ability of <hi>reflection and self-intuition</hi>; are peculiar, invaluable, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifts.

            <p>But these heavenly gifts are neglected and abused all the World over. Degenerate Souls are every where fallen into so deep an Oblivion of their excellent Original, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Immortal nature; and alliance to the Father of Spirits: That (to use the upbraiding expression of a great <note place="margin">

            <p>So powerfully do the Cares and Pleasures of this World charm all (except a small remnant of regenerate Souls) that nothing but some smart stroke of Calamity, or the terrible Messengers of death can startle them: (and even these are not always able to do it) and when they do, all the effect is but a transient glance at another, and an unwilling shrug to leave this World; and so to sleep again: And thus the Impressions and Sentiments of the World to come,

            <p>And for its self-reflecting and considering <hi>Power,</hi> it seems in many to be a power received in vain.

What serious heart doth not melt into Compassion over the deluded Multitude, who are mockt with Dreams, and perpetually busied about Trifles? Who are, (after so many frustrated attempts both of their own, and all past Ages) eagerly pursuing the fleeing shadows, who torture and rack their brains, to find out the Natures and Qualities of Birds, Beasts, and Plants; indeed any thing rather than their own Souls, which are certainly the most excellent Creatures that inhabit this World. They know the true value and worth of other things, but are not able to estimate the dignity of that high-born Spirit which is within them. A Spirit which (without the addition of any more natural Faculties or Powers; if those it hath be but sanctified and devoted to God) is capable of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Perfections and Fruitions, even compleat Conformity to God, and the satisfying Visions of God throughout eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

            <p>As for me, it hath been my sin, and is now the matter of my Sorrow; that whilst <hi>Myriads</hi> of Souls (of no higher Original than mine) are some of them beholding the highest Majesty in Heaven, and others giving all diligence to make

sure their Salvation on earth; I was carried away so many years in the course of this World, (like a drop with the Current of the Tide) wholly forgetting my best self, my invaluable Soul; whilst I prodigally wasted the stores of my time and thoughts upon Vanities, that long since pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed away as the waters which are remembred no more. <note n="*" place="margin">Nec enim pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det Sancto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> It shall be no shame to me to confess this folly, since the matter of my Confession shall go to the glory of my God. I studied to know many other things, but I knew not my self. It was with me as with a Servant to whom the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster commits two things, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Child,</hi> and the <hi>Child's Clothes</hi>; the Servant is very careful of the Clothes, washes and brushes, starches and steels them, and keeps them safe and clean: but the Child is forgotten and lost. My Body which is but the Garment of my Soul, I kept and nourished with excessive care, but my Soul was long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and had been lost for ever as others daily are, had not God rouz'd it by the Convictions of his Spirit out of that deep Oblivion and deadly slumber.</p>
            <p>When the God that formed it, out of free grace to the work of his own hands, had thus recovered it to a sense of its own worth and danger; my next work was to get it united with <hi>Christ,</hi> and thereby secured from wrath to come. Which I found to be a work of difficulty to <hi>effect,</hi> (if it be yet effected) and a work of time to <hi>clear,</hi> though but to the degree of good hope through grace.</p>
            <p>And since the hopes and evidences of Salvation began to spring up in my Soul, and settle the state thereof, I found these three great words, <hi>viz. Christ, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> to have a far different, and more awful sound in my ear than ever they used to have. I looked on them from that time, as things of greatest certainty, and most awful Solemnity. These things have lain with some weight upon my thoughts, and I have felt at certain seasons, a strong inclination to sequester my self from all other Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb facs="tcp:63760:11"/>
and spend my last days, and most fixed Meditations upon these three great and weighty Subjects.</p>
            <p>I know the subject matter of my Studies and Enquiries (be it never so weighty) doth not therefore make my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and Discourses upon it great and weighty: Nor am I such a vain <hi>Opiniona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or</hi> as to imagine my Discourses every way suitable to the dignity of such Subjects; No, no, the more I think and study about them, the more I discern the indistinctness, darkness, crudity, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of my own conceptions, and expressions of such great and transcendent things as those: But, <hi>In magnis volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse sat est,</hi> I resolved to do what I could; and accordingly some years past I finished and published in two parts the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> and by the acceptation and success the Lord gave that, He hath encouraged me to go on in this Second part of my work, how unequal soever my Shoulders are to the burden of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nature, Original, Immortality,</hi> and <hi>Capacity,</hi> of mine own Soul, for the present lodged in, and related to this vile Body, destinated to Corruption; Together with its <hi>Existence, Imployment, Perfection, Converse with God,</hi> and other <hi>Spirits,</hi> both of its own, and of a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Rank and Order; when it shall, (as I know it shortly must) <hi>put off this its Tabernacle:</hi> These things have a long time been the matters of my limited desires to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, so far as I could see the Pillar of fire (God in his Word) enlightening my way to the knowledge of them. Yea, such is the value I have for them, that I have given them the next place in my esteem, to the knowledge of Iesus Christ, and my interest in him.</p>
            <p>God hath formed me (as he hath other men) a <hi>prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Creature.</hi> I feel my self yet uncentred, and short of that state of rest and satisfaction to which my Soul in its Natural and Spiritual Capacity hath a Designation.

abode, and the expence of my time, and many Infirmities tell me I am not far from it: By all which I am strongly prompted to look forward, and acquaint my self as much as I can, with my next place, state, and imployment. I look with a greedy and inquisitive eye that way.</p>
            <p>Yet would I not be guilty of an unwarrantable Curiosity, in searching into unrevealed things; how willing soever I am to put up my head by faith into the World above, and to know the things which Iesus Christ hath purchased and prepared for me, and all the rest that are waiting for his appearance and Kingdom.

               </note> The helps <hi>Philosophy</hi> affords in some parts of this Discourse, are too great to be <hi>despised,</hi> and too small to <hi>be admired.</hi> I confess I read the Definitions of the Soul given by the Ancient <hi>Philosophers,</hi> with a Compassionate smile. When <hi>Thales</hi> calls it a <hi>Nature without Repose.</hi> Asclepiades, <hi>an Exercitation of sense.</hi> Hesiod, <hi>a thing composed of Earth and Water.</hi> Parmenides, <hi>a thing composed of Earth and Fire. Galen</hi> saith it is <hi>heat.</hi> Hippocrates, <hi>a Spirit diffused throughout the Body.</hi> Plato, <hi>a Self-moving Substance. Aristotle</hi> calls it, <hi>Entelechia, that by which the Body is moved.</hi> If my Opinion should be asked, which of all these <hi>Definitions</hi> I like best? I should give the same Answer which <hi>Theocritus</hi> gave to an ill <hi>Poet,</hi> repeating many of his Verses, and asking which he liked best, <hi>Those</hi> (said he) <hi>which you have omitted.</hi> Or if they must have the
<pb facs="tcp:63760:12"/>
               <hi>Garland</hi> as the prize they have shot for, let them have it upon the same reason that was once given to him that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways shot wide, <hi>Difficilius est toties non attingere,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was the greatest difficulty to aim so often at the Mark, and never come near it. One Word of God gives me more light than a thousand such laborious trifles. As <hi>Caesar</hi> was best able to write his own <hi>Commentaries,</hi> so God only can give the best account of this his own Creature, on which he hath impressed his own Image.</p>
            <p>Modern <hi>Philosophers</hi> assisted by the Divine Oracles, must needs come closer to the Mark, and give us a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account of the nature of the Soul. Yet I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured not to cloud this Subject with their Controversies, or abstruse Notions; remembring what a smart, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served check <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives those, <hi>Qui Platonicum &amp; Aristotelicum Christianismum procudunt Christianis.</hi> Words are but the Servants of Matter. I value them as <hi>Merchants</hi> do their Ships, not by the gilded <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Stern;</hi> the neatness of their Mould; or curious <hi>Flags</hi> and <hi>Streamers;</hi> but by the soundness of their Bottoms, large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Capacity, and richness of their Cargoe and loading. The quality of this Subject necessitates in many places the use of <hi>Scholastick terms,</hi> which will be obscure to the Vulgar Reader; but apt and proper words must not be rejected for their obscurity, except plainer words could be found that fit the Subject as well, and are as fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive of the matter. The unnecessary I have avoided, and the rest explained as I could.</p>
            <p>The principal fruits I especially aim at, both to my own and the Readers Soul, are, that whilst we contemplate the freedom, pleasure, and satisfaction of that Spiritual, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal People who dwell in the Region of light and joy; and are hereby forming to our selves a true Scriptural <hi>Idea</hi> of the blessed state of those disembodied Spirits with whom we are to serve and converse, in the Temple-worship in
<pb facs="tcp:63760:12"/>
Heaven; and come more explicitely and distinctly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Constitution, Order, and Delightful imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those our everlasting Associates: We may answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably feel the fond and inordinate love of this Animal life subacted and wrought down; the frightful Vizard of death drop off, and a more pleasing Aspect appear; that no up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Soul that shall read these Discourses may henceforth be convuls'd at the name of death, but chearfully aspire, and with a pleasant expectation wait for the blessed season of its transportation to that blessed Assembly. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our ignorance of the life of Heaven, that makes us dote as we do upon the present life. There is a gloom, a thick Mist overspreading the next life, and hiding even from the eyes of Believers, the glory that is there. We send forth our thoughts to penetrate this Cloud, but they return to us without the desired success: We reinforce them with a Sally of new and more vigorous thoughts, but still they come back in confusion and disappointment, as to any perfect account they can bring us from thence, though the oftner and closer we think, the more still we grow up into acquaintance with these excellent things.</p>
            <p>Another benefit I pray for, and expect from these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, is, that by describing the horrid state of those Souls which go the other way, and shewing to the living, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal condition of Souls departed in their unregenerate state, some may be awakened to a seasonable and effectual Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their wretched Condition whilst they yet continue under the means and among the Instruments of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Whatever the fruit of this Discourse shall be to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thers, I have cause to bless God for the advantages it hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy given me. I begin to find more than ever <hi>I</hi> have done, in the separate state of sanctified Souls, all that is capable of attracting an intellectual nature: and if God will but fix my mind upon this state, and cause my pleased thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:63760:13"/>
about it to settle into a frame and steddy temper; I hope I shall daily more and more depreciate and despise this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of existence in a Corporeal Prison; and when the blessed season of my departure is at hand, I shall take a chearful farewel of the greater and lesser Elementary World, to which my Soul hath been confined, and have an abundant Entrance, through the broad gate of Assurance, unto the blessed unbodied Inhabitants of the World to come.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Chaldee</hi> renders it <hi>a Speaking Soul.</hi> And indeed it deserves a remarque, that the ability of Speech is confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on no other Soul but mans.

it into words, by which the notions and sentiments of one Soul, are in a noble, apt, and expeditious manner, conveyed to the understanding of another Soul. And indeed, what should any other creature do with the faculty or power of speech, without a principle of Reason to guide and govern it? It is sufficient to them that they discern each others meaning by dumb signs, much after the manner that we traded at first with the <hi>Indians:</hi> But speech is proper only to the rational or living Soul.

            <p n="2">(2.) We find here the best account that ever was given of the <hi>Origin</hi> of the Soul of man, or whence it came, and from whom it derives its Being.

Why was it infused into this Body? And where must it abide, when Death hath dislodg'd it out of this frail Tabernacle?</hi> There is a natural aversation in Man to such exercises of thoughts as these, although in the whole Universe of Beings in this lower World, a more noble or desirable Creature is not to be found <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>IN this Description we have the two general parts into which I distributed this Discourse; <hi>viz.</hi> its general <hi>Nature,</hi> and Divine <hi>Original.</hi> The Nature of the Soul is expressed to us in these following terms.</p>

They flow from, and as to their very Essence, depend upon praeexistent matter; but the Soul was created out of nothing, and infused into the body after it was formed, and orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized; which evidenceth its substantial Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) This evidenceth the Soul to be a <hi>Substance,</hi> that it can and doth exist and subsist by it self alone, when se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the body by Death. Luk. 23.43. <hi>To day shalt thou</hi> (i. e. thy Soul) <hi>be with me in Paradise</hi>; and <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the Soul.</hi> Were the Soul but an Accident, a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a Result, he that kills the Body must needs kill the Soul too. As he that casts a Snow-ball into the fire, must needs destroy the whiteness with the Snow. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents fail and perish with their Subjects: but seeing it's plain in these and many other Scriptures, the Soul doth not fail with the body; nothing can be more plain and evident, than that it is of a substantial Nature.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came first among the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> they thought the Horse and his Rider to be one Creature; as many ignorant ones think the Soul and Body of Man to be nothing but <hi>Breath</hi> and <hi>Body</hi>: whereas indeed they are two distinct Creatures, as vastly different in their Natures, as the <hi>Rider</hi> and his <hi>Horse,</hi> or the <hi>Bird</hi> and his <hi>Cage.</hi> While the Man is on Horseback, he moves according to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Horse; and whilst the Bird is incaged, he eats and drinks, and sleeps, and hops, and sings in his Cage. But if the Horse fail and dye under his Rider, or the Cage be broken, the Man can go on his own feet, and the Bird en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy himself as well, yea better in the open Fields and Woods,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63760:21"/>
than in the Cage: neither depend as to Being or action, on the Horse or Cage.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Both <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Philosophy</hi> consent in this, that the Soul is the chief, most noble, and principal part of Man, from which the whole Man is, and ought to be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated. So Gen. 46.26. <hi>All the Souls that came with Iacob into Aegypt</hi> (i. e.) all the persons, as the Latines say <hi>tot capita,</hi> so many Heads, or Persons. The Apostle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. seems to exclude the body from the notion of <hi>personality,</hi> when he saith, <hi>We are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord</hi>: that <hi>We,</hi> a term of <hi>personality</hi> is there given to the <hi>Soul</hi> exclusively of the <hi>Body</hi>: for the Body cannot be absent from it self; but <hi>We,</hi> that is, the Souls of Believers, may be both absent from it, and present with Christ.</p>
            <p>To this we may add 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. where the Soul is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Man,</hi> and the <hi>inner Man</hi> too, the body being but the external face or shadow of the Man. And to this <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> agrees. The best <hi>Philosophers</hi> are so far from thinking that the body is the substantial part of Man, and the Soul a thing dependent on it; that contrarily they affirm that the body depends upon the Soul, <note n="*" place="margin">

James 2.26. <hi>The body without the Spirit is dead.</hi> It acts not at all but as it is acted by this invisible spirit. This is so plain that it admits of sensible proof and demonstration. Take meer matter, and compound or divide it, alter it and change it how you will, you can never make it see, feel, hear, or act vitally without a quickning and actuating Soul: Yet we must still remember, that this active, vital principle, the Soul, though it hath this vital Power in it self, it hath it not from it self, but in a constant receptive dependance upon God, the first Cause both of its Being and Power.</p>

            </p>
            <p>All Substances are not gross, material, visible and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble substances, but there are spiritual and immaterial, as well as corporeal substances discernable by Sight or Touch. To deny this were to turn a downright <hi>Sadducee,</hi> and to deny the existence of Angels and Spirits, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.8. The word <hi>Substance</hi> as it is applied to the Soul of Man, puzzles and confounds the dark understandings of some, that know not what to make of an immaterial Substance, whereas in this place it is no more than <note n="*" place="margin">A Substance in this use of the word, is that which depends not in respect of its Being upon any other fellow creature, as Accidents and Qualities do, whose Being is by having their in-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in another fellow creature as their subject; but this Being, <hi>The Soul,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists in it self.</note> 
               <hi>substare accidentibus,</hi> (i. e.) to be a subject in which, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, affections and habits are seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and subjected. This is a spiritual Substance, and is frequently in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture called a Spirit; <hi>into thy hands I commit my spirit,</hi> Luke 23.46. <hi>Lord Iesus receive my spirit,</hi> Acts 7.59. and so frequently all over the Scriptures. And the spirituality of its nature ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears (1.) by its Descent in a peculiar way from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits: (2.) in that it rejoyceth in the essential Properties of a Spirit: (3.) That at Death it returns to that great Spirit who was its Efficient and Former.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It descends in a peculiar way from the Father of Spirits, as hath been shewn in the opening of this Text: God stiles himself its Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. its Former, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.1. 'Tis true, he giveth to all living things <gap reason="foreign">

They flow not immediately from him by Creation,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.24, 27.</note> as this doth. It is said, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth the living Creature after his kind, but God created Man in his own Image:</hi> Which seems plainly to make a specifical difference betwixt the reasonable and all other Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63760:22"/>(2.) It rejoyceth in the essential Properties of a Spirit: for it is an incorporeal Substance, as Spirits are. It hath not <hi>partes extra partes,</hi> extension of parts: nor is it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, as the body is: It hath not Dimensions and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures as matter hath; but is a most pure invisible and (as the acute and judicious Dr. <hi>More</hi> expresseth it) an indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpible Substance. It hath the Principle of Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it self, or rather, it is such a Principle it self, and is not moved as the dull and sluggish matter is <hi>per aliud,</hi> by another. Its efficacy is great, though it be unseen, and not liable to the Test of our touch, as no spiritual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are. A Spirit (saith Christ) hath not Flesh and Bones, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. We both grant and feel that the Soul hath a love and inclination to the body, (which indeed is no more than it is necessary it should have;) yet can we no more inferr its Corporeity from that love to the body, than we can infer the Corporeity of Angels from their affection and benevolent love to men. It is a Spirit of a nature vastly different from the body in which it is <hi>immersed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hows</hi> Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Serm. <hi>p.</hi> 9, 10.</note> There is (saith a learned Author) <hi>no greater mystery in nature, than the union betwixt the Soul and Body. That a Mind and Spirit should be so ty'd and linkt to a clod of Clay, that while that remains in a due temper, it cannot by any art or power free it self! — What so much a-kin are a Mind and a piece of Earth, a Clod, and a Thought: that they should be thus affixed to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, the heavenly pure Bodies do not differ so much from a dunghil, as the Soul and Body differ: they differ but as more pure and less pure matter; but these, as material and immaterial. If we consider wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the Being of a Body, and wherein, that of a Soul, and then compare them, the matter will be clear.</p>
            <p>We cannot come to an apprehension of their Beings, but by considering their primary passions and properties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they make discovery of themselves. The first and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary affection of a body <note n="*" place="margin">Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Essay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 2. §. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 39.</note> (as is rightly observed) is that extension of parts whereof it is compounded, and a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Division, upon which, as upon the fundamental mode,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63760:23"/>
the particular Dimensions (that is, the figures) and the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal motion do depend.</p>
            <p>Again, for the Being of our Souls, if we reflect upon our selves we shall find, that all our knowledge of them resolves into this, that we are Beings conscious to our selves of several kinds of cogitations; that by our outward sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses we apprehend bodily things present, and by our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination we apprehend things absent. And that we oft recover into our apprehension things past and gone, and upon our perception of things, we find our selves variously affected.</p>
            <p>Let these two properties of a Soul and Body be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and upon the first view of a considering mind it will appear, that Divisibility is not Apprehension, or Judgment, or Desire, or Discourse: That to cut a body into several parts, or put it into several shapes, or bring it to several motions, or mix it after several ways, will never bring it to apprehend, or desire. No man can think the combining of Fire, and Air, and Water, and Earth, should make the lump of it to know or comprehend what is done to it, or by it.

And when that deceit was discovered, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged no other grace but outward instruction, or the benefit of external revelation, to discourse and put men in mind of their duty. Being yet driven farther, he acknowledged the grace of Pardon; and before a man could do any thing acceptably, there was a necessity of the remission of sin, and then he might obey God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. But that not sufficing, he acknowledged another grace, <hi>viz.</hi> the example of Christ, which doth both se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our rule, and encourage our practice. And last of all, his followers owned some kind of internal grace, but they made that to consist in some illumination of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or moral perswasion, by probable arguments, to excite the will, and this not absolutely necessary, but only for facilitation, as an Horse to a journey, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a man might go a-foot.

Thus have they been forced to quit and change their ground, but still the pride of nature will not let men see the necessity of divine efficacious influences upon the Will, and the consistency thereof with natural Liberty.</p>

It saith, as the <hi>Centurion did,</hi> I am in authority, and God hath put the many members of the body in subjection to me. I say to one, Move, and it moves; to another, Stop, and it stops; and to a third, Do this, and it doth it. The obsequious members like so many Servants have their eyes waiting on the imperial Commands of the Will, and it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable to behold, with what dispatch and speed they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute its Commands, as if their obedient motions were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concomitant, than subsequent acts to the Wills man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates. Let it but command to have the windows of the body open, or shut, and its done in a moment, in the twink of an eye. And so for the rest of the external sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and members, they pay it most ready Obedience. Yet when I say, the Will hath a <hi>despotical</hi> and absolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over the members, it must be understood with a double limitation. <hi>First,</hi> They are only at its beck for use and service, it can use them whilst well, and rightly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; but it cannot perpetuate them, or restore them when indisposed. If the Soul will the health and life of the body never so intensely and vehemently, it cannot keep off Death one moment the longer from it. And, <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Its Soveraignty no way intrenches upon, not interferes with the Dominion of Providence over the members of the body, and the various motions of them. God hath reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Soveraign <hi>negative voice</hi> to himself, whatever Decrees the Will passes. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> stretches out his hand against the man of God to smite him, but God puts a <hi>remora</hi> in the very instant to the loco-motive faculty, that though he would never so fain, he could not pull in his hand again to him; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.4. The Will commands the service of the tongue, and chargeth it to deliver faithfully such or such words, in which, it may be, the ruine of good men may
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63760:28"/>
be imported, and when it comes to do its office, the tongue faulters, and contrary to the command of the Will, drops some word, that discovers and defeats the design of the Will, according to that in <hi>Iob</hi> 12.20. <hi>He removeth away the speech of the trusty.</hi> This is its Despotical and Soveraign power over the external members of the body.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It hath a <hi>political</hi> power over the faculties and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Soul, not by way of absolute command, but by way of <hi>suasion,</hi> and <hi>insinuation.</hi> Thus it can oft times perswade the understanding and thoughts to lay by this or that subject, and apply themselves to to the study of another. It can bridle, and restrain the Affections and Passions, but yet it hath no absolute command over the inner, as it hath over the outward man: Its weakness and inability to govern the inner man, appears in two things more especially remarkable, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. It cannot with all its power and skill command and fetch off the thoughts from some subjects which are set on, at some times with extraordinary weight upon the Soul. However the thoughts may obsequiously follow its beck at some times, yea, for the most part; yet there are Cases and Seasons, in which its authority and perswasions cannot disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage one thought, as (1.) when God hath to do with the Soul in the work of Conversion. When he convinceth of sin and danger, and sets a mans evils in order before his eyes: These are terrible representations, and fain would the carnal will disengage the thoughts from such sad subjects, and strives by all manner of perswasions and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions so to do; but all to no purpose. Psal. 51. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>My sin is ever before me.</hi> The thoughts are fixt, and there is no removing of them. It may give them a little interruption, but they return with the more impetuous violence. And instead of gaining them off, they at last (or rather, God by them) gains over the Will also. (2.) When <hi>Satan</hi> hath to do with the Soul in the way of <hi>Temptation,</hi> and hellish <hi>Suggestion.</hi> Look as the Carnal will opposed it self to the thoughts in the former case to no purpose; so the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Will opposes it self to them in this case, oft-times with as little effect or success, as he that opposeth his weak
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63760:28"/>
breath to the strong Current of a mighty River. Well were it, if the Sanctified Will were now the master of the Phantasie, and could controul the thoughts of the heart; but like a mad horse, the <hi>Phansie</hi> takes the Bit in its Teeth, and runs whither it pleaseth; the Will cannot govern it.

It cannot quiet and compose a raging Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and reduce it at its pleasure to Rest and Peace. This is the peculiar work of God. He only that stills the stormy Seas, can quiet the distressed and tempestuous Soul. The impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the will in this case is known to all that have been in those deeps of trouble. And this is the misery of the <hi>Devil</hi> and the <hi>damned,</hi> that though they would never so fain, yet they cannot get rid of those tormenting impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made upon them by their own trembling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Consciences. There would not be so many pale, sweating, affrighted Consciences on Earth, and in Hell, if the Will had any command or power over them.

When this is won, the Soul is won to Christ; and if this stand out in rebellion against him, he is barr'd out of the Soul, and can have no saving union with it.

               </note> God hath planted in it, <hi>Fear, Grief, Indignation, Iealousie, Anger,</hi> &amp;c. to grapple with, and break through those intercurrent difficulties, and hazzards. By these weapons in the hand of grace, it conflicts with that which opposes its passage to God, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> expresseth that holy fret and passion of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and what a fume their souls were in, by the gracious motion of the irascible appetite, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. <hi>For behold this self same thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort; what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of your selves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge?</hi> Much like the raging and strugling of Waters, which are interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their course by some <hi>dam,</hi> or <hi>obstacle,</hi> which they strive to bear down, and sweep away before them.</p>
            <p>But the Soul considered in full union with, and fruition of God its supream Happiness, is accordingly furnished with the affections of <hi>Love, Delight,</hi> and <hi>Ioy</hi>; whereby it rests in him, and enjoys its proper blessedness in his presence for ever. Yea, even in this life these affections are in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect degree exercised upon God, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libations and enjoyments it hath of him by faith in its way to Heaven. In a word,</p>
            <p>The true uses and most excellent ends for which these affections and passions are bestowed upon the Soul of man, are to qualifie it, and make it a fit subject to be wrought upon in a moral way of perswasions and allurements in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63760:29"/>
to its union with Christ, (for by the affections, (as Mr. <hi>Fenner</hi> rightly observes) the Soul becomes marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or capable of being espoused to him) and being so, then to assist it in the prosecution of its full enjoyment in Heaven, as we heard but now.</p>
            <p>But alas! how are they corrupted and inverted by sin. The <hi>concupiscible</hi> appetite greedily fastens upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not upon God; and the <hi>irascible</hi> appetite is turned against holiness, not sin. But I must insist no farther on this subject here, it deserves an intire Treatise by it self.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII.<note n="8" place="margin"> And an inclination and love to the Body.</note> The Soul of man hath in the very frame and nature of it an inclination to the body. There is in it a certain <hi>Pondus</hi> or inclination which naturally bends or sways it towards matter, or a body. There are three different Natures found in living Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Brutal.</item>
                  <item>2. The Angelical.</item>
                  <item>3. The Humane.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The Soul of a <hi>Brute</hi> is wholly confined to, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the matter or body with which it is united. It is dependent on it both <hi>in esse, &amp; in operari.</hi> In its being and working; it is but a material form, which rises from, and perisheth with the body. <hi>The Soul of a Brute,</hi>

            <p n="2">(2.) An Angel is a Spirit free from a body, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without an appetite or inclination to be imbodied. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> call the Angels <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Angelus est anima perfecta, &amp; anima est Angelus imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus.</hi> Bell <hi>de Ascen. mentis.</hi>
               </note> An Angel is a perfect Soul, and an Humane Soul an imperfect Angel. Yet Angels have no such rooted disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and abhorrence of a body, but that they have, and can in a ready obedience to their Lords commands, and delight to serve him, assume bodies for a time, to converse with men in them; (<hi>i.e.</hi>) Aerial Bodies in the figure and shape of humane bodies. So we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.2. <hi>three men</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> Angels in humane shape and appearance) stood by <hi>Abraham,</hi> and talked with him; and at Christs Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. <hi>There appeared two men in shining garments.</hi> But they abide in these bodies, as we do in an <hi>Inn</hi> for a night, or short season, they dwell not in them as our souls in those houses of flesh, which we cannot put on and off at pleasure, as they do; but as we walk in our garments, which we can put off without pain.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The humane Soul is neither wholly tyed to the body as the brutal soul is, nor created without inclination to a body, as Angels are; but loves, and inclines to it, though it can both live and act without it, when it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it at death. The proof of this Assertion, and the Reasons why God created it with such an inclination, will in their proper place be more fully spoken to in the following Discourse. All that I shall add is, that in this, as well as in some other respects, our souls are made <hi>a little lower than the Angels,</hi> but when they are uncloathed of the body, and have received it again in a new Edition, a Spiritual body; then they shall be <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Which way the <hi>Doctors</hi> judgment had inclined in this Controversie, had been of no great consideration, to the determination of it. Though it is pity we should lose his consent and company, for the sake of such a beastly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection as this, which haunts his mind: for if there be any such creatures, that seem to have a tincture of reason, it is but a tincture, and a seeming, not a real tincture neither: which many other Brutes have.</p>
            <p>The Dr. is too well acquainted with Philosophy, and a man of too much reason, to allow himself to think, that such a production, as he speaks of, hath two Natures and essential Forms in one body, as of a <hi>Man</hi> and a <hi>Horse.</hi> He knows that every entity hath but one specifical Essence, and can have no more, except he will place one and the same thing under diverse Species in the predicament of substance. And as there cannot be two distinct forms, so neither can there be a mixtion of them in the <hi>Centaure</hi> or monstrous Birth: For <hi>ex duobus entibus per se, non fit unum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Second opinion was, that they were <hi>procreated</hi> by <hi>Angels</hi>; and that which gave the ground (such as it is) to this Opinion, or Fancy, is the similitude or resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance which is found betwixt Angels and the Souls of Men. <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> humane souls to be created together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their bodies, and placed in some glorious and suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mansions, as the Stars, till at last growing weary of Heavenly, and falling in love with Earthly things, for a punishment of that Crime, they were cast into Bodies, as into so many Prisons. <hi>Origen</hi> suckt in this Notion of the praeexistence of Souls. And upon this supposition it was that <hi>Porphyry</hi> tells us in the life of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> that he blushed as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he thought of his being in a Body, as a man that had lived in reputation and honour, blushes when he is lodged in a Prison. The ground on which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> bottomed their Opinion was the great dignity and excellency of the Soul, which inclined them to think they had never been degraded and abased as they are by dwelling in such vile bodies, but for their faults. And that it was for some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sin of theirs, that they slid down into gross matter, and were caught into a vital union with it. Whereas, had they not sinned, they had lived in celestial and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did habitations more suitable to their dignity.</p>
            <p>But this is a pure creature of fancy; for, (1.) no Soul in the world is conscious to it self of such a praeexistence: nor can remember when it was owner of any other habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation than that it now dwells in. (2.) Nor doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture give us the least hint of any such thing. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would catch hold of that expression, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>God
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63760:32"/>
rested the seventh day from all the works which he had made</hi>: And it is true, he did so, the work of Creation was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and sealed up, as to any new <hi>species</hi> or kind of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be created, no other sort of souls will ever be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than that which was at first; But yet God still creates individual Souls (<hi>My father worketh hitherto, and I work</hi>) of the same kind and nature with <hi>Adams</hi> Soul. And (3.) for their detrusion into these bodies as a punishment of their sins in the former state, if we speak of sin in <hi>Individuals</hi> or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons, the Scripture mentions none, either original or actual, defiling any Soul in any other way but by its union with the body. Praeexistence therefore is but a Dream.</p>
            <p>But to me it's clear, that the Soul receives not its being by Traduction or Generation; for that which is generable is also corruptible: but the spiritual immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul (as it hath been proved to be) is not subject to Corruption. Nor is it imaginable how a Soul should be produced out of matter, which is not endued with reason: Or how a bodily Substance can impart that to another, which it hath not in it self. If it be said, the Soul of the child proceeds from the Soul of the Parents: that cannot be; for spiritual Substances are impartible, and nothing can be discinded from them. <note place="margin">

And thus he states it: These two constitutive parts of Man are a <hi>Soul,</hi> and a <hi>Body</hi>: These two parts have two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Originals: The Body as to its material cause is <hi>Dust</hi>; the Soul in its nature is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and as to its Origin, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the <hi>Father of Spirits</hi>: 'tis his own creature in an immediate way. <hi>He gave it</hi>; He gave it the being it hath by Creation, and gave it to us (<hi>i.e.</hi>) to our bodies by Inspiration. Now <hi>qualis Genesis, talis Analysis</hi>: When death dissolves the union which is betwixt them, each part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to that from whence it came, dust to dust, and the Spirit to God that gave it. The Body is expressed by its material cause, dust, the Soul only by its <hi>efficient</hi> cause, as the gift of God, because it had no material cause at all, nor was made out of any praeexistent matter, as the Body was. And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> here speaks of God, as if he had only to do with the Soul, leaving the Body to its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and instrumental causes, with whom he concurrs by a general influence. 'Tis God, not Man alone; or God by Man, that hath given us these bodies: but 'tis not Man but God alone, who hath given us these souls. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore passeth by the Body, and speaks of the Soul as the gift of God, because that part of Man, and that only flows im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God, and at death returns to him that gave it.

are they to each other, and all of them to the point un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand, that the Soul flows from God by immediate Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? You see it hath no principle out of which (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of nature) it did arise, as the body had; and therefore it hath no principle into which (according to the order of nature) it can be returned, as the body hath: but returns to God its efficient cause, if reconciled, to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not only by Creation but Adoption; if unreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as a creature guilty of unnatural Rebellion against the God that formed it, to be judged.</p>

Can they correct their senses, and demonstrate a Star to be far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the whole Earth, which to the eye seems no bigger than the rowel of a Spurr? Do they foreknow the Positions and Combinations of the Planets, and the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Sun and Moon many years before they suffer them? And if they cannot perform these acts of reason, as it is sure they cannot, how much less can they know, fear, love, or delight in God, and long for the enjoyment of him!

And whereas it is so confidently asserted in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, That sin cannot come into the Soul by or from the body, because it being matter, cannot act upon a Spirit: I say, this is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> easily spoken, but difficultly prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Cannot the Body act upon, or influence the Soul? Pray then how comes it to pass, that so many souls become foolish, forgetful, injudicious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by their union with ill disposed Bodies?

            <list>
               <item>(1.) If it be demanded, how it comes to pass that an <hi>Infant</hi> becomes guilty if <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin? The answer is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is a child of <hi>Adam</hi> by natural generation.</item>

               <item>(3.) But how comes he to be inclined to that which is evil? Their answer is, because he wants that original re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude: For whosoever wants original rectitude, naturally inclines to that which is evil.

            <p>And thus I have given some account of the Nature and Original of the Soul of Man, though alas! My dim eyes see but little of its excellency and glory. Yet by what hath been said, it appears the Masterpiece of all God's works of Creation in this lower World.</p>
            <p>But because I suspect the Description I have given of it will be obscure and cloudy to vulgar Readers of a plain and low capacity, by reason of divers <hi>Philosophical</hi> terms which I have been forced to make use of; and reckoning

my self a debtor to the weak and unlearned, as well as others, I will endeavour to strip this Description of the Soul, for their sakes, out of those artificial terms which dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it to them, and present it once more in the most plain and intelligible <hi>Epitome</hi> I am capable to give it in; that so the weaker understanding may be able to form a true notion of the Nature and Original of the Soul in this manner.</p>
            <p>This Soul of mine is a true and real Being:<note place="margin">The Soul a Substance.</note> Not a fancy, a conceit, a very nothing.

My Soul can and will subsist, and remain what it is, when my Body is separated from it; but my Body cannot subsist and remain what it now is, when my Soul is separated from it. So that I find my Soul to be the most substantial and noble part of me, it is not my Body, but my Soul which makes me a man. And if this depart, all the rest of me is but a dead log, a lump of inanimate Clay, a heap of vile dust and corruption. From this independent subsistence it hath in it self, and the dependence its properties and affections have upon it, I truly apprehend and call it a <hi>Substance.</hi>

Let but an <hi>Apoplex</hi> hinder the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my Soul in the Brain, and of how little use are my Eyes, Ears, Hands or Feet to me? My life is originally in my Soul, and secondarily by way of Communication in my Body. So that I find my Soul to be a <hi>vital,</hi> as well as a <hi>spiritual Substance.</hi>

               <note place="margin">An Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Substance</note>And Being both a vital and Spiritual Substance, I must needs conclude it to be an immortal Substance. For in such a pure spiritual nature, as my Soul is, there can be found no seeds or principles of Death. Where there is no composition, there will be no dissolution. My Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed having so many jarring humours, mixed elements, and contrary qualities in it, must needs fail and dye at last. But my Soul was formed for immortality, by the simplicity and spirituality of its nature. No sword can pierce it from without, nor opposition can destroy it from within. Man cannot, and God will not.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">endued with <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Will,</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi>;</note>And being an immortal Spirit, fitted and framed to live for ever, I find that God hath answerably endued and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished it with an <hi>Vnderstanding, Will,</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is capable of being wrought upon, by the spirit in the way of Grace and Sanctification in this world; in order to the enjoyment of God its chief happiness, in the world to come.</p>
            <p>By this its Understanding, I am distinguished from, and advanced above all other creatures in this World. I can apprehend, distinguish, and judge of all other intelligible Beings. By my Understanding I discern truth from false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, good from evil. It shews me what is fit for me to chuse, and what to refuse.</p>
            <p>To this faculty or power of Understanding, my thoughts and conscience do belong: The former, to my <hi>speculative,</hi> the latter to my <hi>practical</hi> Understanding. My thoughts are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63760:37"/>
all formed in my mind or Understanding in innumerable multitudes and variety. By it I can think of things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, or absent; visible, or invisible; of God, or my self; of this, or the world to come.</p>
            <p>To my Understanding also, belongs my <hi>Conscience,</hi> a noble, Divine, and awfull power. By which I summon and judge my self, as at a solemn <hi>Tribunal,</hi> bind and loose, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and acquit my self and actions, but still with an eye and respect to the judgment of God. Hence are my best comforts, and worst terrors.</p>
            <p>This Understanding of mine is the director and guide of my <hi>Will</hi>: That is as the <hi>Counsellor</hi>; This, as the <hi>Prince.</hi> It freely chuseth and refuseth as my Understanding directs and suggests to it. The members of my Body, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of my Soul are under its Dominion. The former are under its absolute command, the latter under its suasions and insinuations, though not absolutely and always with effect and success.</p>
            <p>And both my Understanding and Will, I find to have great influence upon my <hi>Affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Passions and <hi>Affections</hi> of my Soul are of great use and dignity. I find them as manifold as there are conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of good and evil. They are the strong and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motions of my Soul, according to my apprehensions of good and evil. By them my Soul is capable of union with the highest good. By love and delight I am capable of enjoying God, and resting in him as the Centre of my Soul. This noble Understanding, Thoughts, Conscience, <hi>Will,</hi> Passions and Affections, are the principal faculties, acts, and powers of this my high and heaven-born Soul. And being thus richly endowed and furnished,</p>
            <p>I find it could never rise out of matter,<note place="margin">created and infused with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the Body.</note> or come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Body by way of natural generation; the Souls of Brutes that rise that way, are destitute of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Reason, Conscience, and such other excellent facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers, as I find in mine own Soul. They cannot know, or love, or delight in God, or set their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on things spiritual, invisible and eternal, as my Soul is capable to do; it was therefore created and infused im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into this body of mine by the Father of Spirits,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63760:38"/>
and that with a strong inclination, and tender affection to my flesh, without which, it would be remiss and careless in performing its several Duties and Offices to it, during the time of its abode therein.</p>
            <p>Fearfully and wonderfully therefore am I made, and designed for nobler ends and uses, than for a few daies to eat, and drink, and sleep, and talk, and dye. My Soul is of more value than ten thousand Worlds. <hi>What shall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi>

               <p>FRom the substantial Nature of the Soul, which we have proved to be a Being distinct from the Body, and subsisting by it self, we are informed, <hi>That great is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the death of a Man, and the death of all other creatures in the world.</hi> Their souls depend on, and perish with their bodies; but ours neither result from them, nor perish with them. My Body is not a Body, when my Soul hath forsaken it; but my Soul will remain a Soul, when this body is crumbled into dust. Men may live like beasts, a meer sensual life; yea, in some sense, they may dye like beasts, a stupid death: but in this there will be found a vast difference, Death kills both parts of the Beasts, destroyes matter and form; it toucheth only one part of Man, it destroyeth the Body, and only <hi>dislodgeth</hi> the Soul, but cannot <hi>destroy</hi> it.</p>

               <p>How doth this consideration expose and aggravate the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and madness of the sensual world, who herd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with beasts, though they have souls so near of kin to Angels.

Our Tables differ little from the <hi>Crib</hi> at which they feed; or our Houses from the Stalls and Stables in which they lie down to rest, in respect of any Divine worship, or Heavenly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication that is to be heard there.

The Soul of the Child, as well as the Father, the Soul of the <hi>Beggar,</hi> as well as the <hi>King</hi>; Those that had no prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent matter, but received their beings from the same efficient cause, must needs be equal in their original nature and value. The bodies of men which are formed out of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, do greatly differ from one another: some are moulded (as we say) <hi>è meliori luto,</hi> out of better and finer Clay; some are more exact, elegant, vigorous, and beautiful than others:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63760:40"/>
but Souls having no matter of which they consist, are not so differenced.</item>
                     <item>2. Secondly, All souls are created with a capacity of enjoying the infinite and blessed God. They need no other powers, faculties, or capacities than they are by nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with (if these be but sanctified and devoted to God) to make them equally happy and blessed with them that are now before the Throne of God in Heaven, and with unspeakable delight and joy behold his blessed face. We pass through the fields, and take up an Egg which lies under a clod, and see nothing in it but a little squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid matter; yea, but in that Egg is seminally and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially contained such a melodious Lark, as it may be at the same time, we see mounting Heavenward, and sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delicious notes above. So 'tis here. Those poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised souls, that are now lodged in crazy despicable bodies on Earth, have in their Natures a capacity for the same imployments, and enjoyments with those in Heaven. They have no higher Original than these have, and these have the same capacity and hability with them. They are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings improvable by grace, to the highest perfections attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by any Creature. If thou be never so mean, base, and despicable a creature in other respects, yet hast thou a Soul, which hath the same alliance to the Father of Spirits, the same capacity to enjoy him in glory, that the most excellent and renowned Saints <hi>ever</hi> had.</item>
                     <item>3. Thirdly, All Souls are rated and valued in Gods book and account, at one and the same price, and therefore by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are of equal worth and dignity. Under the Law, the Rich and the Poor were to give the same Ransom, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.15. <hi>The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel.</hi> The Redemption of Souls by the Blood of Christ, costs one and the same price. The poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most despised Soul that believes in Jesus, is as much indebted to him, for the Ransom of his Soul, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most illustrious person in the World. <hi>Moses, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. did not cost Christ one farthing more than poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or the meanest among all the Saints did.

                        <hi>The Righteousness of Christ is unto all, and upon all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and there is no difference,</hi> Rom. 3.22.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But yet we must not understand this <hi>Parity</hi> of humane Souls universally, or in all respects. Though being of one <hi>species,</hi> or common nature, they are all equal, and those of them that are purchased by the blood of Christ, are all purchased at one rate; Yet there are divers other respects and considerations, wherein there are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able differences betwixt Soul, and Soul. As (1.) some Souls are much better lodged and accommodated in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies than others are, though none dwell at perfect rest and ease. God hath lodged some Souls in strong, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, comely bodies, others in feeble, crazy, deformed and uncomfortable ones. The Historian saith of <hi>Galba, Anima Galbae male habitat</hi>: The Soul of <hi>Galba</hi> dwelt in an ill Body. And a much better man than <hi>Galba,</hi> was as ill accommodated: <hi>Iohn</hi> wishes in behalf of his beloved <hi>Gaius,</hi> that his body might but prosper as his Soul did; <hi>Epist.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Timothy</hi> had his often infirmities.

(3.) And yet a far greater difference is made betwixt one Soul and another, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit of God.

It pleaseth us to see our own Image stampt upon their bodies; but O! how few pray, even whilst they are in the womb, that their Souls may in due time bear the image of the heavenly, and not animate and use the members of their bodies, as wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of unrighteousness against the God that formed them?</p>

But as soon as such a Soul enters into them, though for never so little a time, it entails Eternity upon them. We also know, that as soon as ever God breathes or infuses their Souls into them, sin presently enters, and death by sin, and that by us, as the next Instruments of conveying it to them: Which should have the efficacy of a mighty Argument with us, to lay our prayers and tears for mercy, in the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that union.</p>
               <p>Think on this particularly, you that are Mothers of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when you find the fruit of the Womb quickned within you; that you then bear a creature within you of more value than all this visible world, a creature, upon whom, from that very moment, an eternity of happiness or misery is entailed, and therefore it concerns you, to travel, as in pain for their souls, before you feel the sorrows and pangs of travel for their bodies. O! what a pity is it, that a part of your selves should eternally perish! That so rare and excellent a creature as that you bear, should be cast away for ever, for want of a new Creation super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to that it hath already! O! let your cries and prayers for them, anticipate your kisses and embraces of them. If you be faithful and successful herein, then happy is the Womb that bears them; if not, happy had it been for them, that the knees had prevented them, and the breasts they have sucked. O! you cannot begin your suits for mercy too early for them, nor continue them too long, though your prayers measure all the time betwixt their Conception and their Death.</p>

               <p>Such a nature as this, is not fitted to live upon gross, material and perishing things as the body doth. The food of every creature is agreeable to its nature, one cannot subsist upon that which another doth: As we see among the several sorts of Animals, what is food to one, is none to another. In the same Plant there is found a root, which is food for <hi>Swine,</hi> a stalk which is food for <hi>Sheep,</hi> a flower which feeds the <hi>Bee,</hi> and a seed on which the <hi>Bird</hi> lives.

It were therefore too brutish, and unworthy of a man that understood the nature of his own Soul, to chear it up with the stores of earthly provisions made for it, as he did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.20. <hi>I will say to my Soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</hi> Alas, the Soul can no more eat, drink, and be merry with carnal things, than the Body can with spiritual and immaterial things: It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feed upon bread that perisheth, it can relish no more in the best and daintiest fare of an earthly growth, than in the White of an Egg: But bring it to a reconciled God in Christ, to the Covenant of Grace, and the sweet promises of the Gospel; set before it the joyes, comforts and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nests of the Spirit; and if it be a sanctified renewed Soul, it can make a rich Feast upon these.

We read of many bodies possessed by him, but he never takes up his quarters in the body of any, but with design to mischief the Soul. No room but the best in the house will satisfie him, no blood so sweet to him him as Soul-blood. If he raise persecution against the bodies of men, it is to destroy their souls; holiness is that he hates, and happiness is the Object of his envy: The Soul being the Subject of both, is therefore pursued by him as his prey.</p>

               <p>UPon the consideration both of its excellent nature, and divine Original, it follows, <hi>That the corruption and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acing of such an excellent creature by sin, deserves to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and greatly bewailed; and the recovery of it by sanctification to be studied, and diligently prosecuted, as the great concern of all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a Beautiful and Blessed creature was the Soul of Man at first, whilst it stood in its integrity? His mind was bright, clear, and apprehensive of the Law and Will of God: His Will chearfully complied therewith, his sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive appetite, and inferiour powers stood in an obedient subordination. God made man upright, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.29. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> straight, and equal; bending to neither extream. The Law of God was fairly engraven upon the table of his heart. Principles of holiness and righteousness were inlayed in the very frame of his mind, fitting him for an exact and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual discharge of his duties, both to God and Man. This was the soundness of his constitution, the healthful temper of his inner man: Whereby it became the very region of light, peace, purity, and pleasure. For think how serene, lightsome, and placid the state of that Soul must be, in which there was no obliquity, not a jarr with the divine will: But joy and peace continually transfused through all its faculties!</p>
               <p>But sin hath defaced its Beauty, raz'd out the divine Image which was its glory, and stampt the very Image of Satan upon it: Turn'd all its noble powers and faculties against the Author and Fountain of its Being. Surely, if all the posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> from the beginning to the end of the world, should do nothing else but weep and sigh for the sin and misery of the fall; it could not be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently deplored: Other sins, like single bullets kill particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons, but <hi>Adams</hi> sin like a Chain-shot mowed down all mankind at once. It murthered himself <hi>actually,</hi> all his posterity, <hi>virtually</hi>; and Christ himself, <hi>occasionally.</hi> O!

what a black train of doleful consequents attend this sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It hath darkned the bright eye of the Souls understanding, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. made its complying and obedient will, stubborn and rebellious, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.40. rendered his tender heart obdurate and senseless, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. filled its serene and peaceful Conscience with guilt and terror, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. The consideration of these things is very humbling, and should cause those that glory in their high and illustrious Descents, to wrap their silver Star in <hi>Cypress,</hi> and cover all their glory with a mourning Vail. But this is but one part of their duty.</p>
               <p>How should this consideration provoke us, to apply our selves with most serious diligence, to recover our lost beauty and dignity, in the way of sanctification! This is the great and most proper use of the Fall, as <hi>Musculus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently speaks; <hi>ut gratiam Christi eo subnixius ambiamus,</hi> to inflame our desires the more vehemently after grace.</p>
               <p>Sanctification restores the Beauty of the Soul, which sin defaced. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10.

O! that God would set the glass of the Law before us, that we may see what defiled souls we have by nature, that we might come by faith to Jesus Christ, who cometh to us by water, and by blood. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.6.</p>

By Christs <hi>coming</hi> in, is meant his uniting that Soul unto himself, that opens to him: And as his <hi>coming in,</hi> denotes uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so his supping with the Soul, and the Soul with him,

denotes his sweet Communion; imperfect here, compleat and full in Heaven.</p>
               <p>O The admirable condescensions of God to poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners! The God that formed you with a word, and can as easily ruine you with a frown; yet waits at the gates of your Souls for admission into them. There be many Souls within the sound of this complaint, that have kept God out of his own right, all their days. They have shut out Jesus Christ, and delivered up their Souls to Satan; if he but knock by a slight Temptation, the door is presently open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but Jesus Christ may wait in vain upon them, from Sabbath to Sabbath; and from Year to Year. But the longest day of his patience hath an end. And there is a refusal of Grace, after which, no more tenders of mercy shall ever be made.</p>
               <p>What say you, Souls, will you at last open the door to Jesus Christ, or will you still exclude him? If you will open to him, he will not come in empty-handed, he will bring a feast with him, such a feast, as you never tasted any thing like it in your lives: But if you will not open to him; then I call Heaven and Earth to witness against you this day, that you have once more barr'd the doors of your Souls against him, whose pleasure and power gave them their very Beings: Against him, who is their Soveraign Lord, and rightful Owner; and consequently, this Act of yours must stop your mouths, and deprive you of all Pleas and Apologies, when you shall knock hereafter at the door of mercy, and God shall for ever shut it up against you, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>There is</hi> (saith a learned Man) <hi>no greater mystery in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than the union betwixt the Soul and Body: That a mind and spirit should be so tyed and linked with a clod of Clay; that while that remains in a due temper, it cannot by any art, or power free it self. It can by an act of the Will move an hand, or a foot, or the whole body; but cannot move from it one inch. If it move hither, or thither, or by a leap upward, do ascend a little, the body still follows; it cannot shake or throw it off. We cannot take our selves out; by any allowable means we cannot, nor by any at all (that are at least within meer humane power) as long as the temperament lasts. While that remains, we cannot go; if that fail, we cannot stay, though there be so many open avenues (could we suppose any material bounds to hem in, or exclude a spirit) we cannot go out, or in at pleasure. A wonderful thing! And I wonder, we no more wonder at our own make and frame in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect —What so much akin are a mind and a piece of earth, a clod and a thought, that they should be thus affixed to one another?</hi>

            <p>The Breath, and Soul of Man are two distinct things. His Breath is not his Soul, nor his Soul his Breath, but the <hi>Nexus</hi> or bond that couples and unites his Soul and body in a personal union.

Our breath is always going, and what is still going, will be gone at last. How small a difference is there betwixt Respiration and Expiration? A breathing, and a breathless lump of clay? Breath cannot continue long, and life cannot stay a moment behind it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.29. <hi>Thou takest away their breath, they dye; and return to their dust.</hi> Life is breath given, and Death is breath taken away.

               <p>The time is at hand, when all these comely and active bodies, shall be so many breathless carkasses, no more capable of any use or service for our Souls, than the seats you sit on, or the dead bodies that lye buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your feet. Your breath is yet in your Nostrils, and all the means and seasons of salvation will expire with it; and then it will be as impossible for the best Minister in the world to help your Souls, as for the ablest <hi>Physician</hi> to recover your Bodies. As Physick comes too late for the one, so counsels and perswasions for the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three</hi> things are worth thinking on in this matter.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. First, that you are not without the hopes and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of Salvation, whilst the breath of life is in your Nostrils. A mercy (how lightly soever you value it) that would ravish with joy those miserable Souls, that have already shot the gulf of Eternity, and turn the shrieks and groans of the Damned into joyful shouts and acclamations of praise. Poor wretch, consider what thou readest; That thy Soul is not yet in Christ, is thy greatest misery, but that yet it may be in Christ, is an unspeakable mercy: though thy Salvation be not yet secured, yet, what a mercy is it, that it is not des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</item>
                  <item>2. Secondly, When this uncertain breath is once expired, the last hope of every unregenerate person is gone for ever. It is as impossible to recover hope, as it is to recover your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63760:53"/>
breath, or recall the day that is past. When the breath is gone, the <hi>Compositum</hi> is dissolved. We cease to be, what now we are, and our life is as water spilt on the ground, which shall not be gathered up till the Resurrection. Our life is carried like a precious liquor in a brittle Glass, which death breaks to pieces. The Spirit is immediately presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, and fixed in its unalterable State. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 9.27. All means of Salvation now cease for ever. No <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors</hi> of peace are sent to the Dead. No more Calls, or Strivings of the Spirit, no more space for Repentance. O! what an inconceivable weight hath God hanged on a puff of breath?</item>
                  <item>3. Thirdly, And since matters stand thus, it is to be admired, what shift men make to quiet themselves in so dangerous a State, as most Souls live in: quiet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned, and yet, but one puff of breath betwixt them and Hell! O the stupefying and besotting nature of sin! O the efficacy and power of spiritual delusions! Are our lives such a throng and hurry of business, that we have no time to go alone and think, where we are, and where we shortly must be? What shall I say? If bodily concerns be so weighty, and the matters of Eternity such trifles; if meat, and drink, and trade, and children, be such great things, and Christ, and Soul, and Heaven, Hell, and the world to come, such little things in your eyes; you will not be long in that opinion, I dare assure you.</item>

               <p>There is no more but a puff of breath, a blast of wind betwixt this world, and that to come. A very short step betwixt time and Eternity. There is a breath, which will be our last breath. Respiration must and will terminate in Expiration.

               <p n="1">1. You that are now so near Salvation, were lately very near unto Damnation: there was but a puff of breath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and Hell. How many nights did you sleep secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the state of nature and unregeneracy? How quietly did you rest upon the brink of Hell, not once imagining the danger you were in? Had any of those sicknesses you then suffered, been suffered by God, like a candle to burn asunder this slender thread of life, which was so near them, you had been as miserable and as hopeless, as those that now are roaring in the lowest Hell. I have heard of one that rid over a dangerous Bridge in the night, who upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63760:54"/>
of the place next day, fell into a swoon, when he was sensible of that danger which the darkness of the night hid from him. O Reader, shall not an escape from Hell affect thee, as much as such an escape would do?</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis no less marvelous to consider where you now are; you that were afar off, are now made nigh, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13. you that were not beloved, are now beloved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 25. You were in the state of death and condemnation; you are now passed from death to life, by your free justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14. Your union with Christ hath set you free from condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. Dye you must, though Christ be in you, but there is no hazzard or hurt in your death. The stopping of your breath, can put no stop to your happiness, it will hasten, not hinder it. If the pale Horse come for you, Heaven, not Hell will now follow him; your sins are pardoned, the covenant of your Salvation sealed, death is disarmed of its fatal sting, and what then should hinder you from a like Triumph even upon your death-bed, with that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>O death, where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And yet you have more room for joy, whilst you consider where you must and shall be shortly. You are now in <hi>Christ,</hi> but in a few days you shall be <hi>with Christ,</hi> as well as in him: 'tis well now, but it will be better ere long. Your sin is now fully <hi>pardoned,</hi> but not fully <hi>purged</hi> out of your Souls. Your <hi>Persons</hi> are freed from guilt, but your <hi>Hearts</hi> are not either freed from filth or grief: But in a little time you shall be absolutely and eternally freed from both your present condition is an Heaven, compared with your former, and your future state will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">II. But on the other side, what meditation can be more startling and amazing to all the unregenerate and Christless world? Ponder it thou poor Christless and unsanctified Soul. Get thee out of the noise and clamour of this world,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63760:54"/>
which makes such a continual din in thine ears, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how thou hangest over the mouth of Hell it self, by the feeble thread which is spun every moment out of thy Nostrils. As soon as that gives way, thou art gone for ever. What shift do you make to quiet your fears, and eat and drink and labour with any pleasure? 'Tis storied of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant, that when <hi>Democles</hi> would have flattered him into a conceit of the perfection of his happiness, as he was an absolute Soveraign Prince, and could do what he pleased with others, as his <hi>Vassals; Dionysius</hi> to confute his fancy, caused him to be placed at a Table richly furnished, and attended with the most curious Musick, but just over his head hanged a sharp and heavy Sword by one single hair; which when <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocles</hi> saw, no meat would go down with him, but he earnestly begged for a discharge from that place. This is the lively emblem of thy condition thou unregenerate man.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>three</hi> things in thy state sadly opposed to the former state last described.</p>
               <list>

                  <item>2. The state you are now in, is worse.</item>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The State you were born in, was a sad state: you were born in sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51 5. and under wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. the womb of nature cast you forth into this world, both defiled and condemned creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The state you are in now, is much worse than that you were born in: for what have you been doing ever since you were born, but treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. For every sand of time which run out of the glass of Gods patience towards you, a drop of wrath hath been running into the Vials of his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against you. O what a treasure of sin and wrath then is laid up in so many years as you have lived in sin? Every sin committed, every mercy abused, every call of God
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63760:55"/>
neglected, and slighted, adds still more and more to this treasure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will be much worse shortly than it is now, except preventing renewing grace step in betwixt you, and that wrath, into which you are hastning so fast. 'Tis sad to be under the <hi>Sentence</hi> of Condemnation, but unspeakably worse, to be under the <hi>Execution</hi> of that sentence. To be a <hi>Christless</hi> man is lamentable, but to be a <hi>hopeless</hi> man is more lamentable.

                  </gap> all the world cannot save or help you. Your last breath, and your last hope expire together. Though you be under Gods damning sentence, yet that sentence through the riches of forbearance is not executed; but assoon as you dye, all that wrath which hang'd over your heads, so many years, in the black clouds of Gods threatnings, will pour down in a furious storm upon you, which will never break up whilst God is God. O think, and think again, and let your thoughts think close to this sad and solemn Subject, there is but a Breath betwixt you and Hell.</p>

               <p>'Twere better you had never breathed at all, than to spend your breath in prophane Oaths, or foolish and idle Chat, whereby at once you wound the Name of God, draw guilt upon your own Souls, and help on the ruine of others. That is a startling Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36. <hi>But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak; they shall give an account thereof in the day of Iudgment.</hi>

The intercourse betwixt the heart and tongue is quick, and the sense of the evil as easily and quickly passeth away. (2) Because the poisonous and malignant influence thereof abides and continues long after: Our words may mischief others, not only a long time after they are spoken, but a long time after the tongue that spake them is turned to dust. How many years may a foolish or filthy word, a prophane scoff, an Atheistical expression stick in the minds of them that heard them, after the Speakers death! A word spoken, is <hi>Physically</hi> transient, and past away with the breath that delivered it: but it's <hi>Morally</hi> permanent; for as to its moral efficacy, no more is required, but its obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive existence in the minds and thoughts of them that once heard it: And upon that very ground <hi>Suarez</hi> argues for a general Judgment, after men have past at death their particular Judgment; because (saith he) long after that, abundance of good and evil will be done in this World by the Dead, in the persons of others that ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>LEt your breath promote the spiritual life of others, as well as maintain the natural life in your selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Though the maintaining of your natural life, be one end why God gave you breath, yet it is not the only, or principal end of it. Your breath must be food to others, as well as life to you. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.21. <hi>The lips of the righteous feed many.</hi> It will be comfortable to resign that breath to God at death, which hath been instrumental to his glory in this life. It was no low <hi>encomium</hi> Christ gave of the Church, when he said, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Thy lips, O my Spouse, drop as the Honeycomb, Honey and Milk are under thy Tongue.</hi> Sweet, wholesome, and pleasant words dropt from her lips. They drop (saith Christ) <hi>as the Honeycomb.</hi> Some drops ever and anon fall actually, and others hang at the same time prepared and ready to fall. Such a prepared and habitual Disposition, should every Christian continually have. Your Words may stick upon mens hearts to their Edification and Salvation, when you are in your Graves. Your Tongues may now sow that precious seed, which may spring-up to the praise of God, though you may not live to reap the comfort of it in this World, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.36, 37. 'tis a rich expence of your breath, to bring but one Soul to God, and yet God hath used the breath of one, as his instrument, to save edifie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Souls of thousands, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 11.30. <hi>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he that winneth Souls is wise.</hi> The good Lord make all his people wise in this.</p>
               <p>Surely, whether we consider the invaluable worth and preciousness of Souls, the benefits you have had from the breath of others your selves, the innate property of grace, whereever it is, to diffuse and communicate it self; how short a time you have to breath, and how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable it will be, when you breath your last, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

If you will not spend your <hi>Breath</hi> for God, How will you spend your <hi>Blood</hi> for him? If you will not <hi>Speak</hi> for him, I doubt you will not <hi>Die</hi> for him.

Well, you are now together, something you must say; the same breath would serve for a Compassionate Admonition, as for a Complacent Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, which will redound to neither of your advantages.

               </p>
               <p>The breath of many Ministers is <hi>judicially</hi> stopt already, their breath serves to little other use than to preserve their own lives; it will be stopt ere long by death, and then those excellent treasures of Gifts and Graces, wherewith they are richly furnished, will be gone out of your reach, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be further useful to your Souls.

               <p>But alas, we rather divert, than draw forth these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies that are in them.

How must it gall an awakened <hi>Iew,</hi> to think what Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course he had with Jesus Christ? <hi>Is it lawful to give Tribute to Caesar? Why do not thy Disciples fast?</hi> O had I nothing else to enquire of the Lord Jesus? Would it not have been more pertinent to have asked, What shall I do to be saved? But he is gone, and I dead in my sins. How many persons have we sent away, that had a word of Wisdom in their hearts? Having only learnt from them what a Clock it is, what Weather, or what News: Forgetting to ask our own hearts, What is all this to us? And to enquite of them things worthy of their Wisdom and Experience. <hi>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a Fool, seeing he hath no heart to it?</hi> Proverbs 17.16. The expence of one Minutes breath in season, may if God concur with it, be to you the ground of breathing forth praises to God to all eternity.</p>

               <p>We lay the Plot and Design of our future earthly felicity in our own thoughts, we mould and contrive a design for a long and pleasant life. The model for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing an Estate is already formed in our thoughts, and we have not patience to defer our pleasure till the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, but presently draw a train of pleasing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents from this <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and our thoughts can stoop to nothing less than sitting down all the remainder of our days, in the very lap of delight and pleasure: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that our breath is all the while in our Nostrils, and may expire the next moment; and if it do, the stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of all our Expectations and Projects come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the same moment: <hi>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his dust; and in that very day his thoughts perish.</hi> Psal. 146.4. The whole frame of his thoughts falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly abroad, by drawing out this one pin, his breath. Tis good with all our earthly designs, to mingle the serious thoughts of the Dominion of Providence, and our own frailty, <hi>Iames</hi> 4.15 <hi>If the Lord will, and we live.</hi>

The best of men must die, as well as the worst, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. 'tis a vanity therefore to rely upon any man. It was the saying of a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> when he heard how Merchants lost great Estates at Sea in a moment, <hi>Non amo foelicitatem è funibus pendentem</hi>; I love not that Happiness (said he) which hangs upon a Rope. But all the happiness of many men, hangs upon a far weaker thing than a Rope, even the perishing breath of a Creature.</p>
               <p>Let not Parents raise their hopes too high, or lean too hard upon their Children, say not of thy Child as <hi>Lamech</hi> did of <hi>Noah, this Son shall comfort us,</hi> Gen. 5.29. The World is full of the Laments and bitter Cries of disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Parents. Let not the Wife depend too much on her Husband, as if her earthly Comforts were secured in him, against all danger. God is often provoked to stop our friends breath, that thereby he may stop our way to sin. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.5.

A gloomy and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal day it was indeed to the poor Saints, when they eat the bread of their Souls, as it were by weight, for he that sate on him, had a pair of ballances in his hand.

And most aptly Christ is represented to <hi>Iohn</hi> in this figure, and Souls of the Martyrs at the foot or basis of this Altar, thereby to inform us (1) that however men look upon the death of those persons, and though they kill their names by slanders, as well as their persons by the Sword; yet in Gods account, they dye as Sacrifices, and their blood is no other than a drink-offering poured out to God, which he highly prizeth, and graciously accepteth. Suitable whereunto <hi>Pauls</hi> expression is, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.17. (2) That the value and acceptation their death and blood shed hath with God, is through Christ, and upon his account; for it is the Altar which sanctifieth the gift. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.19. and (3.) it informs us that these holy Souls, now in a state of Separation from their Bodies, were very near to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in Heaven. They lay as it were at his foot.</p>
            <p>Once more, They are here described to us, by the cause of their sufferings and death in this World, and that was, <hi>For the word of God, and for the Testimony which they held.</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:63760:61"/>
(i. e.) They dyed in defence of the Truths, or will of God revealed in his word, against the Corruptions, Oppositions, and Innovations of Men. As one of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> that held up the Bible at the Stake, saying, This is it that hath brought me hither. They dyed not as Malefactors, but as Witnesses. They gave a threefold Testimony to the truth, a lip Testimony, a life Testimony, and a blood Testimony; whilst the Hypocrite gives but one, and many Christians but two. Thus we have an account of what <hi>Iohn saw.</hi>

That those his Enemies which oppose his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by slaying his Saints, may be made his footstool, which is the same thing Christ waits for in glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here we find Gods gracious Answer to the cry of these Souls, in which he speaks satisfaction to them two ways:

               <p>The point I am to discourse from this Scripture, is the immortality of the Soul, for the better understanding whereof, let it be noted that there is a twofold Immortality.</p>

               <p>In the former Sense, God only hath Immortality, as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. our Souls have it as a gift from him. He that created our Souls out of nothing, can, if he please, reduce them to nothing again; but he hath bestowed Immortality upon them, and produced them in a nature suitable to that his appointment: fitted for an everlasting life. So that, though God by his absolute power can, yet he never will annihilate them, but they shall and must live for ever in endless Blessedness or Misery; Death must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy these mortal Bodies, but it cannot destroy our Souls. And the certainty of this assertion is grounded upon these reasons, and will be cleared by these following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                  <p>Death is the great Divider, but it is of things that are divisible. The more simple, pure and refined any material thing is, by so much the more permanent and durable it is found to be. The nearer it approacheth to the nature of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the farther it is removed from the power of death: but that which is not material, or mixed at all, is wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the stroke and power of death. It is from the contrariant qualities and jarring humours in mixed Bodies, that they come under the Law and power of dissolution.

                  <p>But the Soul of man is a simple, spiritual, immaterial, and unmixed Being, not compounded of matter and form, as other Creatures are, but void of matter, and altogether Spiritual: as may appear in the vast capacity of its under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing faculty, which cannot be straitned by receiving multitudes of Truths into it. It need not empty it self of what it had received before, to make way for more truth; nor doth it find it self clogg'd or burthened by the greatest multitudes or varieties of Truths, but the more it knows, the more it still desires to know. Its capacity and appetite are found to inlarge themselves according to the increase of knowledge. So that to speak as the matter is, if the Knowledge of all Arts, Sciences, and Mysteries of Nature could be gathered into the mind of one man; yet that mind would thirst, and even burn with desire after more knowledge, and find more room for it than it did when it first sipt and relished the sweetness of truth. Knowledge, as Knowledge, never burthens or cloys the mind; but like fire increases and enlarges, as it finds more matter to work upon. Now, this could never be, if the Soul were a material Being.

                     <hi>Argument</hi> II.</head>
                  <p>THE Immortality of the Souls of Men may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Promises of everlasting Blessedness, and the Threatnings of everlasting miseries respectively made in the Scriptures of truth, to the Godly and ungodly, after this Life; which Promises and Threatnings had been altogether vain and delusory, if our Souls perish with our Bodies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, God hath made many everlasting Promises of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness, yea he hath established an everlasting Covenant, betwixt himself and the Souls of the Righteous; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be their God for ever, and to bestow endless Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness upon them in the World to come. Such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is that, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.28. <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whosoever drinketh of the Water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the Water that I shall give him, shall be in him a Well of Water, spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63760:64"/>
up into everlasting life.</hi> And again, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.26. <hi>Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver liveth and believeth in me, shall never dye.</hi> And once more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well doing, seek for Glory and Honour, and Immortality, eternal Life</hi>: with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes more of like nature.</p>
                  <p>Now if these be no vain and delusory Promises, (as to be sure they are not, being the words of the true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God) then those Souls to whom they are made, must live for ever; for if the subject of the Promises must fail, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the performance of the Promises must fail too. For how shall they be made good, when those to whom they are made, are perished?</p>
                  <p>Let it not be objected here, That the Bodies of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are concerned in the promises, as well as their Souls, and yet their Bodies perish, notwithstanding.</p>
                  <p>For we say, though their Bodies dye, yet they shall live again, and enjoy the fruit of the Promises in eternal Glory: And whilest their Bodies lie in the Grave, their Souls are with God, enjoying the covenanted Blessedness in Heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10, 11. and so the Covenant-Bond is not loosed betwixt them and God, by Death, which it must needs be, in case the Soul perished when the Body doth. And upon this Hypothesis that Argument of Christ is built, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. proving the Resurrection from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God made with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob. I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Isaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob. <hi>God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living. q. d.</hi> If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> be perished in Soul as well as in Body, how then is God their God? what is become of the Promise and Covenant-Relation? for if one <hi>Correlate</hi> fail, the <hi>Relation</hi> necessarily fails with it. If God be their God, then certainly they are in being; for God is not the God of the Dead, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) of those that are utterly perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore it must needs be, that though their Bodies be naturally dead, yet their Souls still live; and their Bodies must live again at the Resurrection, by vertue of the same Promise.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. On the contrary, many threatnings of eternal misery af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, are found in the Scriptures of truth, against
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63760:65"/>
ungodly and wicked Persons. Such is that in 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. <hi>The Lord Iesu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> shall be revealed from Heaven in flaming Fire, to render Vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ, who shall be punished with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and the Glory of his Power.</hi> And speaking of the Torments of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Christ</hi> thus expresseth the misery of such wretched Souls in Hell, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44. <hi>Where their Worm dyeth not, and the fire is not quenched.</hi> But how shall the Wicked be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with everlasting Destruction, if their Souls have not an everlasting Duration? Or how can it be said, <hi>That their Worm</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the remorse and anguish of their Consciences) <hi>dieth not,</hi> if their Souls dye? Punishment can endure no longer than its subject endureth. If the being of the Soul cease, its pains and punishments must have an end.</p>
                  <p>You see then, there are everlasting Promises and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to be fulfilled, both upon the Godly and Ungodly. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him, Iohn</hi> 3.36. The Believer shall never see spiritual Death, <hi>viz.</hi> the separation of his Soul from God; and the Unbeliever shall never see life, <hi>viz.</hi> the blessed fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of God; but the Wrath of God shall abide on him. If Wrath must abide on him, he must abide also as the wretched subject thereof, which is another Argument of the Immortality of Souls.</p>

                        <item>1. That the Habits of Grace be everlasting.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>It must needs follow that the Soul, their Subject, is so too, an everlasting and immortal Soul. And how plainly do both these Propositions lie before us in the Scriptures? As for the immortal and interminable nature of saving Grace, it is plain to him that considers, not only what the fore cited Scriptures speak about it, calling it <hi>incorruptible Seed, a Well of Water springing up into everlasting life:</hi> But add to these what is said of these Divine qualities, in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. where they are called the <hi>Divine Nature</hi>: and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.18. <hi>The life of God,</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:63760:67"/>
noting the perpetuity of these Principles in Believers, as well as their resemblance of God in Holiness, who are endowed with them.</p>
                  <p>I know it is a great question among Divines, <hi>An gratia in renatis sit naturà &amp; essentià suà interminabilis?</hi> Whether these Principles of Grace in the Regenerate be everlasting and interminable in their own nature and essence? For my own part I think that God only is naturally, essentially, and absolutely interminable and immortal. But these gracious Habits, planted by him in the Soul, are so by vertue of Gods Appointment, Promise and Covenant. And sure it is that by reason hereof they are interminate, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for my purpose, if they be not essentially intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Though Grace be but a Creature, and therefore hath a <hi>pesse mori,</hi> yet it is a Creature begotten by the Word and Spirit of God, which live and abide for ever, and a Creature within the Promise and Covenant of God, by reason whereof it can never actually dye.</p>
                  <p>And then, as for the inseparableness of these Graces from the Souls in whom they are planted, how clear is this from 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.27. where sanctifying Grace is compared to an Unction, and this Unction is said to abide in them: And 1 <hi>Iohn,</hi> 3.9. 'tis called the Seed of God, which remaineth in the Soul. All our natural and moral Excellencies and Endowments go away when we dye, <hi>Iob</hi> 4.21. <hi>Doth not their Excellency that is in them go away?</hi> Men may out-live their acquired Gifts, but not their supernatural Graces: These stick by the Soul as <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi,</hi> and where it goes, they go too; so that when the Soul is dislodged by Death, all its Graces ascend up with it into Glory: it carries away all its Faith, Love, Delight in God, all its comfortable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, and fruits of Communion with God, along with it to Heaven. For Death is so far from divesting the Soul of its Graces, that it perfects in a Moment all that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in them; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. <hi>When that which is perfect shall come, then that which is in part shall be done away,</hi> as the Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is done away when the Sun is up, and at its Zenith. So then, Grace never dyeth, and this never-dying Grace is inseparable from its Subject; by which it is plain to him that considers, That as Graces, so Souls abide for ever.</p>

                  <p>THE Immortality of the Soul of Man may be evinced from the Dignity of Man above all other Creatures (Angels only excepted) and his Dominion over them all.</p>
                  <p>In this the Scriptures are clear, that Man is the Master-piece of all Gods other work, Psal. 8.5, 6. <hi>For thou hast made him a little lower than the Angels and hast crowned him with glory and honour. Thou hast made him to have Dominion over the works of thy hands, thou hast put all things under his feet.</hi> Other Creatures were made for his service, and he is crowned King over them all. One Man is of more worth than all the inferiour Creatures.</p>
                  <p>But wherein is his Dignity and excellency above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, if not in respect of the capacity and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of his Soul? Sure it can be found no where else, for as to the Body, many of the Creatures excel man in the perfections of Sense, greatness of Strength, agility of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>&amp;c. Nos Aper auditu praecellit, aranea tactu, vultur odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratu, linx visu, simia gustu:</hi> And for beauty, <hi>Solomon in all his Glory was not arrayed like one of the Lilies of the Field.</hi> The <hi>Beasts,</hi> and Fowls enjoy more pleasure, and live dive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of those cares and cumbers which perplex and wear
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63760:68"/>
out the lives of men. It cannot be in respect of bodily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections or pleasures that man excels other Creatures.</p>
                  <p>If you say, he excels them all in respect of that noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of Reason, which is peculiar to man, and his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular excellency above them all.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, this is his glory, but if you deprive the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Soul of Immortality, you despoil it of all, both its glory and comfort, and put the reasonable into a worse condition than the unreasonable and brutish Creatures; for if the Soul may dye with the Body, and man perish as the Beast, happier is the life of the Beast, which is perplexed with no cares nor fears about futurities: our Reason serves to little other purpose, but to be an engine of Torture, a meer <hi>Rack</hi> to our Souls.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, the Priviledge of Man doth not consist in that, as abstracted from Immortality. But in this it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly consists, that he enjoys not only a reasonable, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so rejoyceth in an Immortal Soul, which shall overlive the world, and subsist separate from the Body, and abide for ever, when all other Souls being but material forms, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with that matter on which they depend. This is the proper Dignity of Man above the Beast that perisheth, and to deprive him of Immortality, and leave him his Reason, is but to leave him a more miserable and wretched Creature than any that God hath put under his feet. For Man is a prospecting Creature, and raiseth up to himself vast hopes and fears from the world to come: by these he is restrained from the sensual pleasures which other Creatures freely enjoy, and exercised with ten thousands cares which they are unacquainted with; and to fail at last of all his hopes and expectations of happiness in the world to come, is to fall many degrees lower than the lowest Creature shall fall, even so much lower, as his expectations and hopes had lifted him higher.</p>

No <hi>Motto</hi> better suits it than this, <hi>Non est mortale quod opto.</hi> I seek for that which will not die. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 7. and his great relief against death lies in this, <hi>Non omnis moriar</hi>: That he shall not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally perish.

So that no Elect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be a Reprobate, no Reprobate an Elect person. (5) This number was chosen to Salvation, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.9. No less did God design for them than glory and happiness, and that for ever.

The cunning Artist had so framed it, that by Wheels and other Machins placed within it, it could pronounce words articulately. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> being surprized to hear the Statue speak, was affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, and brake it all to pieces: Upon which <hi>Albertus</hi> told him, he had at one blow destroyed the work of thirty years. Such a blow would the death of the Soul give to the counsels and thoughts not of Man, but of God, not of thirty years, but from everlasting.</p>
                  <p>If the Souls of men perish at death, either God never did appoint any Souls to Salvation, as the Scriptures testifie he did, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.9. or else the foundation of God stands not sure, as his word tells us, it doth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. So then, this supposition overturns the eternal Decrees and Counsels of God, which is the first thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It overthrows the Covenant of Redemption betwixt the Father and the Son, before this World was made. There was a federal transaction betwixt the Father and Son from Eternity, about our Salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13. In that Covenant Christ engaged to redeem the Elect by his bloud. And the Father promised him a reward of those his sufferings, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.12. accordingly he hath poured out his Soul to death for them, finished the work, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.4. and is now in Heaven, expecting the full reward and fruits of his sufferings, which consist not in his own personal glory, which he there enjoys, but in the compleatness and fulness of his mystical Body, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.24.</p>
                  <p>But certainly, if our Souls perish with our Bodies, Christ hath a very bad bargain of it. Nor can that promise be ever made good to him, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.12. <hi>He shall see of the travel of his Soul, and be satisfied.</hi> He hath done his work,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63760:72"/>
but where is his reward? See how this supposition strikes at the justice of God, and wounds his faithfulness, in his Covenant with his Son. He hath as much comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the Travel of his Soul, as a Mother that is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered after many sharp pangs of a Child that dies almost as soon as born.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It overthrows the Doctrines of Christs Incarnation, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, and Intercession in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for us. And these are the main Pillars both of our faith and comfort; take away these, and take away our lives too, for these are the springs of all joy and comfort to the people of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Incarnation</hi> was necessary to capacitate him for his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial work. It was not only a part of it, but such a part, without which he could discharge no other part of it. This was the wonder of men and Angels, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. A God incarnate is the Worlds wonder. No condescension like this, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Death</hi> of Christ hath the nature and respect of a Ransom, or equivalent price laid down to the justice of God for our Redemption, <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. It bought our Souls from under the curse, and purchased for them everlasting Blessedness, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ from the Dead, hath the nature both of a Testimony of his finishing the work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and the Fathers full satisfaction therein, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.10. and of a Principle of our Resurrection to eternal life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ascension</hi> of Christ into Heaven, was in the capacity and relation of a forerunner, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. It was to prepare places for the redeemed, who were to come after him to glory in their several generations, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.2.3.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ in Heaven, is for the security of our purchased inheritance, to us, and to prevent any new breaches which might be made by our Sins, whereby it might be forfeited, and we divested of it again, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.1, 2.</p>
                  <p>All these joyntly make up the foundation of our faith and hope of glory. But if our Souls perish, or be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated at death, our Faith, Hope, and Comforts are all Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63760:72"/>
vain Dreams which do but abuse our fond Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) It was not worth so great a stoop and abasement of the blessed God, as he submitted to, in his Incarnation, wherein he appeared in flesh, yea, in the likeness of sinful flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. and made himself of no reputation, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.7. An act that is, and ever will be admired by men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: I say, it was not worth so great a Miracle as this, to procure for us the vanishing comfort of a few years, and that short-lived comfort, no other than a deluding Dream, or mocking Phantasm; For seeing it consists in hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation from the world to come, as the Scriptures every where speak, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.8. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5. if there be no such enjoyments for us there, (as most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there are not, if our Souls perish) it is but a vanity, a thing of nought, that was the errand upon which the Son of God came from the fathers bosome, to procure for us.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) And for what think you was the blood of God upon the Cross? what was so vast and inconceivable a treasure expended to purchase? What! the flattering and vain hopes of a few years, of which we may say, as it was said of the Roman Consulship, <hi>unius anni volaticum gaudium</hi>: the fugitive joy of a year, yea, not only short-lived and vain hopes in themselves, but such, for the sake whereof we abridge our selves of the pleasures and desires of the flesh, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3. and submit our selves to the greatest sufferings in the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. for the Hope of <hi>Israel</hi> am I bound with this chain <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 28.20. was this the Purchace of his bloud? was this it, for which he sweat, and groaned, and bled, and died? was that precious bloud no more worth than such a trifle as this?</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) To what purpose did Christ rise again from the dead, was it not to be the first-fruits of them that sleep? did he not rise as the common Head of Believers? to give us assurance we shall not perish, and be utterly lost in the grave, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if our Souls perish at Death, there can be no Resurrection, and if none, then Christ dyed, and rose in vain, we are yet in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63760:73"/>
our sins, and all those absurdities are unavoidable, with which the Apostle loads this supposition, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4) And to as little purpose was his Triumphant Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion into Heaven, if we can have no benefit by it. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed end of his Ascension was to prepare a place for us, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.2. But to what purpose are those Mansions in the Heavens prepared, if the Inhabitants for whom they are prepared be utterly lost? And why is he called the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, if there be none to follow him, as surely there are not, if our Souls perish with our Bodies? Those Heavenly Mansions, that City prepared by God, must stand void for ever, if this be so.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) To conclude, in vain is the Intercession of Christ in Heaven for us, if this be so. They that shall never come thither, have no business there to be transacted by their advocate for them. So that the whole Doctrine of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ is utterly subverted by this one supposition.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As it subverts the Doctrine of Redemption by Christ, and all the hopes and comforts we build thereon, so it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroys all the works of the Spirit upon the hearts of Believers, and makes them vanish into nothing.</p>
                  <p>There are divers Acts and Offices of the Spirit of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and upon our Souls: I will only single out <hi>three, viz.</hi> his <hi>sanctifying, sealing,</hi> and <hi>Comforting work</hi>; all, things of great weight with believers.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) His <hi>sanctifying work,</hi> whereby he alters the frames and tempers of our Souls, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. old things are past a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, behold, all things are become new.</p>
                  <p>The declared, and direct end of this work of the Spirit upon our Souls, is to attemper and dispose them for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. For seeing nothing that is unclean can enter into the holy place, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.27. <hi>And without holiness no man shall see the Lord, Heb.</hi> 12.14. It is necessary that all those that have this hope in them, should expect to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of their hopes in the way of purification, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3. And this is the ground upon which the people of God do
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63760:73"/>
mortifie their lusts, and take so much pain with their own hearts, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.8. counting it better (as their Lord tells them) to enter into life halt, or maimed, than having two eyes or hands to be cast into Hell. But to what purpose is all this self-denyal, all these heart-searchings, heart-humblings, cryes and tears upon the account of Sin, and for an heart suited to the will of God, if there be no such life to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with God, after this animal life is finished?</p>
                  <p>If you say there is a present advantage resulting to us in this world,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Object.</hi>
                     </note> from our abstinence and self-denial, we have the truer, and longer enjoyment of our comforts on earth by it. Debauchery and licentiousness do not only flat the appetite, and debase and alloy the comforts of this World, but cut short our lives, by the exorbitances and abuses of them.</p>
                  <p>Though there be a truth in this, worth our noting,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sol.</hi>
                     </note> yet (1) Morality could have done all this without sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was no need for the pouring out of the Spirit, for so low a use and purpose as this. (2) And therefore as the <hi>wisdom</hi> of God would be censured and impeached, in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his spirit for an end, which could as well be attained without it, so the <hi>Veracity</hi> of God must needs be affronted by it, who, as you heard before, hath declared, our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the end of our sanctification.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) His <hi>Sealing, Witnessing</hi> and <hi>Assuring</hi> work: we have a full account in the Scriptures, of these Offices and works of the Spirit, and some spiritual sense and feeling of them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own hearts, which are two good assurances, that there are such things as his bearing witness with our Spirits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. his Sealing us to the day of Redemption, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. his earnests given into our hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. All which acts and works of the Spirit, have a direct and clear aspect upon the life to come, and the happiness of our Souls in the full enjoyment of God to eternity. For it is to that life we are now sealed. And of the full sum of that glory, that these are the pledges and earnests. But if our Souls pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish by death, these witnesses of the spirit are Delusions, and his earnests are given us but in jest.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:63760:74"/>(3) His <hi>Comforting</hi> work is a sweet fruit and effect sensibly felt and tasted by believers in this World. He is from this Office stiled the <hi>Comforter, Iohn</hi> 16.7. <hi>signanter, &amp; eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> He so comforts, as no other doth, or can. And what is the matter of his comforts, but the Blessedness to come, the joys of the coming World? <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.13. <hi>Eye hath not seen,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Upon the account of these unseen things, he enableth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to glory in tribulations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4. to despise present things, whether the smiles or the frowns of the World, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24. and <hi>v.</hi> 26. But if the being of our Souls fail at death, these are but the Phantastick joys of men in a dream, and the experiences of all Gods people are found but so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fond conceits, and gross mistakes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This supposition overthrows the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> which is the consolation of Christians. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture believe, that after death hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced our Souls and Bodies for a time, they shall meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and be re-united, and that the joy at their re-union will be to all that are in Christ, greater than the sorrows they felt at parting. This seems not incredible to us, what ever natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral improbabilities and carnal reasons may be against it, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.8. And that because the Almighty power, which is able to subdue all things to himself, undertakes this task, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                  <p>We believe this very same <hi>numerical Body</hi> shall rise again, <hi>Iob</hi> 21.27. by the return of the same Soul into it which now dwelleth in it, and that we shall be the same persons that now we are. The <hi>remunerative justice</hi> of God requiring it to be so.</p>
                  <p>We believe the Souls of the righteous shall be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accommodated, and have a more comfortable habitation in their Bodies than now they have, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42, 43. see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they shall be made like unto Christ's glorious Body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. And that then we shall live after the manner of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.16. without the necessities of this animal life, These are the things we look for according to promise; and this expectation is our great relief against (1) the fears of
<pb facs="tcp:63760:74"/>
death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. (2) against the death of our Friends and Relations, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.14. (3) against all the pressures and afflictions of this life, <hi>Iob</hi> 19.25, 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>But if the being of our Souls fail at death, all hopes and comforts from the Resurrection fail with it; for it is not I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable, that the body should rise, till it be revived, nor how it should be revived, but by the re-union of the Soul with it: and if it be not the same Soul that now inhabits it, we cannot be the same persons in the Resurrection we are now, and consequently, this supposition subverts not only the Doctrine of the Resurrection, but</p>
                  <p n="6">6 It overthrows also the faith of the <hi>Iudgment to come.</hi> For if the Soul perish, the Body cannot rise, or if it rise by a new created Soul, the person raised is another, and not the same that lived and dyed in this World, and consequently, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and punishments to be bestowed and awarded to all men in that day, cannot be just and equal: for we believe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, that (1) The actions which men perform in this life, are not transient, but are filed to their account in the world to come, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7. <hi>here we sow, and there we reap</hi>; Actions done in this World are two ways consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, <hi>viz. Physically,</hi> or <hi>Morally</hi>; in the first consideration they are transient, in the last, permanent and everlasting. A word is spoken, or an Act done, in a moment, but though it be past and gone, and perhaps by us quite forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, God registers it in his Book, in order to the day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) We believe that God hath appointed a day in which all men shall appear before his judgment seat, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all they have done in the Body, whether it be good or evil. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) And that in order hereunto, the very same persons shall be restored by the Resurrection, and appear before God, the very same Bodies and Souls, which did good or evil in this World: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? Justice requires that the rewards and punishments be then distributed to the same persons that did good or evil in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63760:75"/>
this World: which strongly infers the immortality of the Soul, and that it certainly overlives the Body, and must come back from the respective places of their abode, to be again united to them, in order to their great account.</p>
                  <p>By all which you see the clearest proof of the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and how the contrary supposition overthrows our Faith, Duties, and Comforts. Yet all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, how apt are we to suspect this Doctrine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main still dis-satisfyed and doubting about it, when all is said? which comes to pass partly from (1) the subtilty of Satan, who knows he can never perswade men to live the life of Beasts, till he first perswade them to think they shall dye as the Beasts do, (and <hi>partly</hi> from the influence of Sense and Reason upon us, whereby we do too much suffer our selves to be swayed, and imposed upon in matters of greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Religion.

                  <p>But the Soul depends upon matter in all its operations,<note place="margin">

                     </note> but certainly false. There are acts performed by the Soul, even whilst it is in the Body, wherein it makes no use at all of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Such are the acts of Self-intuition, and Self-reflection: and what will you say of its Acts in Raptures and Ecstasies, such as that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. and <hi>Iohn, Revel.</hi> 21.10. what use did their Souls make of the bodily senses or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Spirits then?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And though in its ordinary actions in this life, it doth use the Body, as its Tool or Instrument in working, doth it thence follow, that it can neither subsist or act separate from them in the other World? Whilst a man is on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back in his Journey, he useth the help and service of his Horse, and is moved according to the motion of his Horse, but doth it thence follow, he cannot stand or walk alone, when dismounted at his Journeys end? We know Angels both live, and act, without the ministry of Bodies, and our Souls are Spiritual <hi>Substances</hi> as well as they.</p>

All the means in the World cannot fetch it back into the Body again. She speaks not of the Resurrection, or what shall be done in the World to come, by the Almighty power of God, but of what is impossible to be done in this World by all the skill and power of Man.</p>
                  <p>And for the expression of <hi>Heman,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respect and relate to those services their Souls were now imployed about for the praise of God, with respect to the conversion or edification of others, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 30.8, 9. or at most, to that mediate service and worship, which they give God, in and by their attendance upon his ordinances in this World, and not of that immediate Service and praise, that is performed and given him in Heaven, by the Spirits of just men made perfect, such was the sweetness they had found in these Ordinances and Duties, that they express themselves as loth to leave them.</p>
                  <p>The same answer solves also the Objections grounded upon other mistaken Scriptures, as that <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.39. where man is called a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. It is only expressive of the frailty and vanity of the present ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life we live in this World, to which we shall return no more after death; it denies not life to departed Souls, but the end of this animal life at death, the life we live in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, is of a different nature.</p>

One of the Fathers being invited to dine with a Lady, and waiting some hours till she was drest, and fit to come down, when he saw her, he fell a weeping, and being demanded why he wept, O saith he, I am troubled that you should spend so many hours this morning in pinning and trimming your Body, when I have not spent half the time in Praying, Repenting, and caring for my own Soul. Two things a Master commits to his Servants care, (saith one) the Child, and the Childs cloaths: it will be but a poor excuse for the Servant to say, at his Masters return, Sir, here are all the Childs cloaths neat and clean, but the child is lost. Much so will be the account that many will give to God of their Souls and Bodies at the great day. Lord, here is my Body,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63760:80"/>
I was very careful for it, I neglected nothing that belonged to its content and well-fare; but for my Soul, that is lost, and cast away for ever, I took little care or thought about it. 'Tis remarkable what the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12. We owe nothing to the flesh, we are not in its debt, we have given it all, more than all that belongs to it; but we owe many an hour, many a care, many a deep thought to our Souls, which we have defrauded it of, for the vile Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies sake. You have robb'd your Souls, to pay your flesh. This is madness.</p>

            <p>HAving given some account of the Nature and Immortality of the Soul, we next come to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course its Love and Inclination to the Body, with which it is united, from this Text. The scope of the Apostle is, to press Christians to the exact Discharge of those Relative Duties they owe to each other; particularly, he here urgeth the mutual Duties of Husbands and Wives, <hi>v.</hi> 22. Wives, to an Obedient Subjection; Husbands, to a tender Love of their Wives. This Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he enforceth from the intimate Union which by the Ordinance of God is betwixt them, they being now one Flesh, and this Union he illustrates by comparing it with

            </p>
            <p>And from both these, as excellent Examples and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, he with great strength of Argument urgeth the Duty of Love, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>So ought Men to love their Wives as their own Bodies; he that loveth his Wife, loveth himself.</hi> Self-love is naturally implanted in all Men, and it is the Rule by which we measure out and dispense our Love to others.— <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi>

And if the Soul be at any time weary of, and willing to part, not with a single Member only, but with the whole Body, and loaths its Union with it any longer, yet it hates and loaths it not simply, in and for it self, but because it is so filled with Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases all over, and loads the Soul daily with so much Grief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that how well soever the Soul loves it in it self, yet upon such sad Terms and Conditions, it would not be tied to it. This was <hi>Iob</hi>'s Case, <hi>Iob</hi> 10.1. <hi>My Soul is weary of my Life</hi>; yet not simply of his Life, but such a Life in Pain and Trouble. Except it be in such Respects and Cases, <hi>No Man,</hi> saith he, <hi>ever yet hated his own Flesh</hi>; i. e. No Man in his right Mind, and in the Exercise of his Reason and Sense; for we must except Distracted and Delirious Men, who know not what they do, as also Men under the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Conscience, when God suffers it to rage in Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as <hi>Spira,</hi> and others, who would have been glad with their own Hands, to have cut the Thred that tied their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Souls to their Bodies: Supposing that way, and by that Change, to find some relief.

               <p>THE Souls Love to the Body is so strong, natural, and inseparable, that it is made the Rule and Measure by which we dispence and proportion our Love to others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.19. <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi> And the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.14. tells us, that the whole Law, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) the Second Table of the Law, is fulfilled, or sum'd up, in this Precept, <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy Self.</hi> The meaning is not, that all and every one who is our Neighbour, must be equally near to us, as our own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but it intends, (1.) The Sincerity of our Love to others, which must be without Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

To do by others, or measure to them, as we would have done, or measured unto us; for which Rule, <hi>Severus</hi> the Heathen Emperour honoured Christ and Christianity, and caused it to be written in Capital Letters of Gold. (3.) That we take direction from this Principle of Self-Love, to measure out our Care, Love and Respects to others, according to the different degrees of nearness in which we stand to them. As, (1.) The Wife of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, to whom by this Rule, is due our first Care and Love, as in the Text. (2.) Our Children and Family, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. (3.)

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63760:84"/>
And indeed, as every Christian hath a right to our Love and Care, above other Men, so in some Cases, we are to exceed this Rule of Self-love, by a transcendent act of Self-denyal for them, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. And <hi>Paul</hi> went high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than that, in a glorious excess of Charity, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity or Body of Gods People, preferring their Salvation, not only to his own Body, but to his Soul also, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. but to these extraordinary Cases we are seldome called; and if we be, the Gospel furnisheth us with an higher Rule than Self-love, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.34. But by this principle of Self-love in all ordinary Cases, we must proportion and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence our Love to all others: by which you see what deep rooted fixed Principle in Nature Self-love is, how uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal and permanent alone this is, which else were not fit to be made the measure of our Love to all others.</p>

Believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves find it hard to keep the Golden Bridle of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon their Affections in this matter. 'Tis not every Man hath attained <hi>Agurs</hi> cool Temper, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. that can slack his pace, and drive moderately, where the Interests of the Body are concerned: the best Souls are too warm, the generality in raging Heats, which distract their Minds, as that word, <hi>Matth</hi> 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifies. If the Body were not exceeding dear to the Soul, it would never tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self Day and Night with such anxious Cares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul discovers its Esteem and Value for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in all the <hi>Fears</hi> it hath about it. Did not the Soul love it exceedingly, it would never be affrighted for it, and on its account, so much and so often as it is. What a panick fear do the dangers of the Body cast the Soul into, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7.2. When the Body is in Danger, the Soul is in Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Soul is in Fears and Tremblings about it. These Fears flow from the Souls tender Love and Affection to the Body; if it did not Love it so intensely, it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver afflict and torment it self at that rate it doth about it: Satan the professed Enemy of our Souls, being throughly acquainted with those Fears which flow from the Fountain of Love to the Body, politickly improves them in the way of temptation, to the utter ruine of some, and the great hazard of other Souls: he edges and sharpens his temptations upon us this way; he puts our Bodies into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that he may thereby endanger our Souls; he reckons,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63760:85"/>
if he can but draw the Body into danger, fear will quickly drive the Soul into Temptation: It is not so much from Satans Malice or Hatred of our Bodies, that he stirs up Persecutions against us; but he knows the tie of Affection is so strong betwixt these friends, that Love will draw, and Fear will drive the Soul into many and great Hazards of its own Happiness, to free the Body out of those Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25. <hi>The Fear of Man brings a Snare</hi>: and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. <hi>tortured and tempted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this ground also it is, that this Life becomes a Life of Temptation to all Men, and there is no freedom from that danger, till we be freed from the Body, and set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by Death. Separated Souls are the only free Souls. They that carry no Flesh about them, need carry no Fears of Temptation within them. 'Tis the Body which catches the sparks of Temptation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul manifests its dear Love and Affection to the Body, by its <hi>Sympathy</hi> and compassionate feeling of all its Burdens: Whatever touches the Body by way of <hi>Injury,</hi> affects the Soul also by way of <hi>Sympathy.</hi> The Soul and Body are as the strings of two Musical Instruments, set exactly at one height, if one be touched, the other trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. They laugh and cry, are sick and well together. This is a wonderful Mystery, and a rare Secret, (as a Learned Man observes,) how the Soul comes to sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with the Body, and to have not only a knowledg, but as it were a feeling of its Necessities and Infirmities; how this Fleshly Lump comes to affect, and make its deep Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions upon a Creature of so different a Nature from it, as the Soul or Spirit is. But that it doth so, though we know not how, is plain and sensible to any Man. If any Member of the Body, though but the lowest and meanest, be in Pain and Misery, the Soul is presently affected with it, and commands the Eyes to watch, yea to weep, the Hands to bind it up with all tenderness, and defend it from the least injurious touch; the Lips to complain of its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and beg pity and help from others for it. If the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be in danger, how are the Faculties of the Soul. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Memory, Invention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> imployed with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63760:85"/>
Strength and Concernment for its deliverance. This is a real and unexceptionable Evidence of its dear and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Love to the Body. As those that belong to one My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Body shew their sincere Love this way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25, 26. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.19. So the Soul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Soul manifesteth its Love to the Body by its <hi>Fears</hi> of Death, and extream <hi>Aversation</hi> to a Separation from it. On this account Death is called, in <hi>Iob</hi> 18.14. the King of Terrors, or the Black Prince, or the Prince of Clouds and Darkness, as some translate that place; we read it, the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> meaning, that the Terrors at Death are such Terrors, as subdue and keep down all other Terrors under them, as a Prince doth his Subjects. Other Terrors compared with those that the Soul conceives and conflicts with at parting, are no more than a cut Finger, to the laying ones Head on the Block: O the Soul and Body are strongly twisted and knit together in dear Bands of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Union and Affection, and these Bands cannot be broken without much strugling: Oh, 'tis a hard thing for the Soul to bid the Body farewel, 'tis a bitter parting, a doleful separation: Nothing is heard in that Hour, but the most deep and emphatical Groans; I say, <hi>emphatical Groans,</hi> the deep sense and meaning of which, the Living are but little acquainted with: for no Man Living hath yet felt the Sorrows of a parting pull; what ever other Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows he hath felt in the Body, yet they must be supposed to be far short of these.</p>
               <p>The Sorrows of Death are in Scripture set forth unto us, by the bearing-Throes of a Travelling Woman, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and what those mean, many can tell; the Soul is in labour, it will not let go its hold of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but by Constraint; Death is a close Siege, and when the Soul is beaten out of its Body, it disputes the passage with Death, as Souldiers use to do with an Enemy that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by Storm, and fights and strives to the last. It's also compared to a <hi>Battle,</hi> or <hi>sharp Fight,</hi> Eccles. 8.8. <hi>that war</hi>: That war with an Emphasis. No Conflict so sharp, each labour to the utmost to drive the other from the ground they stand on, and win the field. And tho' Grace much
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63760:86"/>
over-power Nature in this matter, and reconcile it to Death, and make it desire to be dissolved, yet Saints whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put not off this Reluctation of Nature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. Not that we would be uncloathed; as it is with one willing to wade over a Brook to his Fathers House, puts his Foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Water, and feels it cold, starts back, and is loth to venture in. <hi>Not that we would be uncloathed.</hi> And if it be so with Sanctified Souls, how is it, think you, with others? Mark the Scripture-Language, <hi>Iob</hi> 27.8. God taketh away their Souls, saith our Translation; but the Root is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>extrahere,</hi> and signifies, to put out by plain Force and Violence. A Graceless Soul dieth not by Consent, but Force. Thus <hi>Adrian</hi> bewailed his Departure, <hi>O Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula, vagula, blandula, hen quo vadis?</hi> Yea, though the Soul have never so long a time been in the Body, though it should live as long as any of the <hi>Antediluvian Father's</hi> did for many Hundred Years, yet still it would be loth to part; yea, though it endure abundance of Misery in the Body, and have little Rest or Comfort, but time spent in Griefs and Fears, yet for all that, loth to part with it. All this shews a strong inclination and affection to it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It's desire of <hi>Re-union</hi> continuing still with it, in its state of Separation speaks its Love to the Body. As the Soul parted with it in Grief and Sorrow, so it still retains even in Glory an inclination to Re-union, and waits for a Day of Re-espousals: and to that sense, some searching and judicious Men understand those words of <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 14.14. <hi>If a Man die, shall he live again,</hi> viz. by a Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? if so, then all the Days of my appointed Separation, my Soul in Heaven shall wait till that Change come. And to the same sense is that Cry of Separated Souls, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>How long, O Lord,</hi> how long, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of all things, when Judgment shall be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on them that killed our Bodies, and our Bodies so long absent, restored to us again. In that Day of Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the Souls of the Saints come willingly from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it self, to repossess their Bodies, and bring them to a Partnership with them in their Glory; for it is with the Soul in Heaven, as it is with an Husband who is richly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63760:86"/>
feasted, and lodged abroad, but his dear Wife is solitary and comfortless: it abates the compleatness of his joy. Therefore we say, the Saints joy is not consummate till that day.</p>
               <p>There is an exercise for Faith, Hope, and desires on this account in Heaven.</p>
               <p>The Union of Soul and Body is natural, their Separation is not so: many benefits will redound to both by re-union, and the Resurrection of the Body is provided by God, as the grand relief against those prejudices and losses, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Saints sustain by Separation. I say not that the propension or inclination of the Soul to re-union with its Body, is accompanied with any perturbation, or anxiety in its state of Separation, for it enjoys God, and in him a placid rest; and as the Body, so the Soul rests in hope: 'tis such a hope as disturbs not the rest of either: yet when the time is come for the Soul to be re-espoused, it is highly gratified by that second Marriage, glad it is to see its old dear companion, as two Friends after a long Separation. And so much of the evidence of the Souls love to the Body.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Next we are to enquire into the Grounds and Reasons of its love and inclination to the Body. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. First the fundamental Ground and Reason thereof will be found in their <hi>natural Vnion</hi> with each other. There my Text lays it: <hi>No man ever yet hated his [own] flesh.</hi> Mark, the Body is the Souls own;<note place="margin">And this is no more than necessary for the conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Every man loves his own, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.19. All the World is in love with its own, and hence it cares to provide for its welfare, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 5.8 <hi>If any man provide not for his own, he is worse than an Infidel</hi> For nature teacheth all men to do so Why are Children dearer to the Parents than to all others, but because
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63760:87"/>
they are their own, <hi>Iob</hi> 19.17. But our Wives, our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, our Goods are not so much our own as our Bodies are; this is the nearest of all natural Unions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>In this propriety and relation are involved the Reasons and Motives of our love to, and care over the Body, which is no more than what is necessary to their preservation. For, were it not for this Propriety and Relation, no Man would be at any more cost or pains for his own Body, than for that of a Stranger? 'Tis Propriety which naturally draws Love, Care, and Tenderness along with it; and these are ordered by the wisdom of Providence, for the conservation of the Body, which would quickly perish without it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Body is the Souls antient <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>Friend,</hi> with whom it hath assiduously and familiarly conversed from its beginning. They have been partners in each others comforts and sorrows. They may say to each other, as <hi>Miconius</hi> did to his Colleague, with whom he had spent twenty years in the Government of the <hi>Thuringian Church: Cucurri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="3">3. The Body is the Souls house and beloved habitation, where it was born, and hath lived ever since it had a being, and in which it hath enjoyed all its comforts, natural and supernatural, which cannot but strengthen the Souls engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it. Upon this account the Apostle calls it the Souls home, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Whilst we are at home in the Body</hi>: 'Tis true, this house is not so comfortable an habitation, that it should be much desired by many Souls: we may say of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious Souls, that they pay a dear rent for the house they dwell in; or as it was said of <hi>Galba, Anima Galbae male habitat,</hi> their Souls are but ill accommodated, but yet it is their home, and therefore beloved by them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:63760:87"/>4 The Body is the Souls instrument by which it doth its work and business in the World, both natural and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. Through the bodily senses it takes in all the natural comforts of this World, and by the bodily Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers it performs all its Duties and Services. When these are broken and laid aside by death, the Soul knows it can work no more in that way it now doth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.4. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.10. Natural men love their Bodies for the natural plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures they are instrumental to convey to their Souls and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual men, for the use and service they are of to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p n="5">5. The Body is the Souls Partner in the benefit of Christs Purchaces. It was bought with the same price, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. sanctified by the same spirit, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.23. interested in the same promises, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. and designed for the same glory, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.16, 17. So that we may say of it, as it was said of <hi>Augustine,</hi> and his friend <hi>Alippius,</hi> they are <hi>sanguine Christi conglutinati,</hi> glewed together by the bloud of Christ. And thus of the grounds and reasons of its Love.</p>

                  <p>IS it so? <hi>Learn hence the mighty strength and prevalence of Divine Love, which over-powering all natural Affections, doth not only enable the Souls of men to take their Separation from the Body patiently, but to long for it ardently,</hi> Philip. 1.23 While some need <hi>Patience</hi> to <hi>dye,</hi> others need it as much to <hi>live,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.5. 'Tis said <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.11. <hi>They loved not their lives.</hi> And indeed on these terms they first closed with Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.26. To hate their lives for his sake <hi>(ie)</hi> to love them in so remiss a degree, that when ever they shall come in competition with Christ, to regard them no more than the things we hate.</p>
                  <p>The love of Christ is to be the supream love, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be subordinate to it, or quenched by it. 'Tis not its own comfort in the Body, it principally and ultimately designs and aims at, but Christs glory, and so this may be

furthered by the death of the Body, its death thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as eligible to the Soul, as its life, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.20. O this is an high pitch of grace! A great attainment, to say as one did, <hi>Vivere renuo, ut Christo vivam</hi>; I refuse life to be with Christ: Or another when asked whether he was willing to dye, answered, <hi>Illius est nolle mori, qui nolit ire ad Christum</hi>; Let him be loth to dye, that is loth to go to Christ So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.

                     </gap> though they love Christ sincerely, yet they shrink from death cowardly and are loth to be gone. There are <hi>two</hi> sorts of grounds upon which Christians may be loth to be unbodied, 1. Sinful, 2. Allowable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The sinful and unjustifiable grounds are such as these, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) Guilt upon the Conscience, which will damp and discourage the Soul, and make it loth to dye. It arms death with terrour, <hi>the sting of death is sin.</hi> (2) Unmortified af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the World, I mean in such a degree as is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to sweeten death; and make a man a Voluntier in that sharp engagement with that last and dreadful Enemy. It is with our hearts, as with fewel, if green and full of sap, it will not burn, but if that be dried up, it catches presently: mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is the drying up of carnal affections to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is that that resists death, as green Wood doth the fire. (3) The weakness and and cloudiness of Faith. You need Faith to dye by, as well as to live by, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. All these dyed in faith. The less strength there is in Faith, the more in death. A strong Believer welcomes the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Death, when a weak one, unless extraordinarily assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, trembles at them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are grounds on which we may desire a longer continuance in the Body, <hi>warrantably</hi> and allowably: as (1) To do him yet more service in our bodies before we lay them down. This the Saints have pleaded for longer life. <hi>Psal.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 88.11, 12, 13. and <hi>Isai.</hi> 38.18, 19. (2) To see the clouds of Gods anger dispelled, whether publick or personal, and a clear light break out ere we dye, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.13.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63760:88"/>
(3) They may desire with submission to outlive the days of persecution, and not to be delivered into the hands of cruel men, but come to their Graves in peace, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.15. and 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.2. That may be delivered from absurd men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But though some Christians shun death upon a sinful account, and others upon a justifyable one, yet others there are, who seeing their Title clear, their work done, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the Joys of Heaven in the praelibations of Faith, are willing to be uncloathed, and to be with Christ. Their love to Christ, hath extinguished in them the love of life, and they can say with <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 21.13. I am ready. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> longed to come to those Beasts that were to devour him, and so, many of the Primitive Christians: Christ was so dear, that their lives were cheap, and low priz'd things for his enjoyment. And here indeed is the glory and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of a Christians Faith and love to Christ: For (1) it enables him to part chearfully with what he sees and feels, for what his eyes yet never saw. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Whom having not seen ye love.</hi> (2) To part with what is dearest on earth, and lies nearest the heart, of all he enjoys, for Christ's sake. (3) To reconcile his heart to what is most abhorrent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to nature. (4) To endure the greatest of pains and torments to be with him. (5) To cast himself into the vast Ocean of Eternity, the most amazing change, to be with Christ. O the glorious Conquests of Love!</p>

And therefore our Lord tells us, that they who hate not their lives, cannot be his <hi>Disciples,</hi> Luke 12.26. Now will they lose their lives by saving them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.25. And the Reasons are plain and forcible. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now is the proper season for the predominant love to be discovered, it can be hid no longer: And the love of life is the predominant love in all such persons. For do but compare it with their love to Christ, and it will easily be found so: They love their lives <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really,</hi> they love Christ but feignedly and pretendedly; and the <hi>real,</hi> will and must prevail over the <hi>feigned</hi> love. They love their lives <hi>fervently,</hi> and intensely, they love Christ but <hi>coldly</hi> and <hi>remissly</hi>: And the fervent love will prevail over the the remiss love. Their love to their Bodies hath a <hi>root in themselves,</hi> their love to Christ hath no root in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.21. and that which hath a root must needs outlast and outlive that which hath none.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because when life is in hazard, Conscience will work in them by way of Discouragement; 'twill hint the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their eternal state to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tell them, they may cast away their Souls for ever in a Bravado, for though the cause they are called to suffer for, be good, yet their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is bad; and if the <hi>Condition</hi> be not good as well as the <hi>Cause,</hi> a Man is lost for ever though he suffer for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3.

                  <p>IF the Souls of men be naturally so strongly inclin'd and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards the Body, <hi>then hence you may plainly see the Wisdom of God in all the Afflictions and Burdens he lays upon his people in this World, and find that all is but enough to wean off their Souls from their Bodies, and make them willing to part with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The life of the Saints in this World, is generally a burthened and a groaning life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. <hi>In this Tabernaele we groan, being burthened.</hi> Here the Saints feel (1) A burthen of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. this is a dead and a sinking weight.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63760:90"/>
(2) A burthen of Affliction, of this all are Partakers, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. though not all in an equal degree, or in the same kind, yet all have their burthens equal to, and even beyond their own strength to support it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. <hi>pressed above measure.</hi> (3) A burthen of inward troubles for sin, and outward Troubles in the Flesh, both together; so had <hi>Iob, Heman, David,</hi> and many of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, this befals them not (1) Casually, <hi>Iob</hi> 5.6. It rises not out of the Dust: (2) Nor because God loves and regards them not, for they are fruits of his love, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Whom he loveth, he correcteth</hi>: (3) Nor because he takes pleasure in our groans, <hi>Lamen.</hi> 3. <hi>To tread under his feet the Prisoners of the earth, the Lord hath no pleasure:</hi> 'Tis not for his own <hi>pleasure,</hi> but his Childrens <hi>profit, Heb.</hi> 12.10.

                     </gap>fits that result from these burthens, this is not the least, to make you less fond of the body than you would else be, and more willing to be gone to your everlasting rest. And certainly, all the Diseases and Pains we endure in the Body, whether they be upon inward or outward accounts, by Passion or Compassion, from God or Men; will be found but enough to wean us, and loose off our hearts from the fond love of life. Afflictions are bitter things to our taste <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.20. so bitter, that <hi>Naomi</hi> thought a name of a contrary signification fitter for her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted condition: Call me <hi>Marah (i. e.)</hi> bitter, not <hi>Naomi,</hi> pleasant, beautiful. And the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.19. calls them Wormwood and Gall.</p>
                  <p>The great design of God in afflicting them, is the same that a tender Mother projects in putting Wormwood to her Breast, when she would wean the Child.</p>
                  <p>It hath been observed by some discreet and grave Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, that before their remove from one place to another, God hath permitted and ordered some weaning Providence to befal them, either denying wonted success to their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or alienating and cooling the affections of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple towards them, which not only makes the manner of their departure more easie, but the grounds of it more clear. Much so it falls out in our natural death, the comfort of the World is imbittered to us, before we leave it. The longer we live in it, the less we shall like it. We overlive most of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63760:91"/>
our Comforts, which engaged our hearts to it, that we may more freely take our leave of it. It were good for Christians to observe the voice of such Providences as these, and answer the Designs of them, in a greater willingness to die.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is thy Body which was once hail and vigorous, now become a crazy, sickly, pained body to thee? neither useful to God, nor comfortable to thee; a <hi>Tabernacle</hi> to groan and sigh in? And little hopes it will be recovered to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter temper; God hath ordered this to make thee willing to be divorced from it. The less <hi>desireable</hi> life is, the less <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable</hi> death will be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Is thy Estate decayed and blasted by Providence, so that thy life which was once full of Creature-Comforts, is now fill'd with Cares and Anxieties; O 'tis a weaning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to thee, and bespeaks thee the more chearfully to bid the World farewel. The less comfort it gives you, the less it should entangle and engage you. We little know with what aking hearts, and pensive breasts, many of Gods people walk up and down, though for Religion, or Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations sake they put a good face upon it: but by these things God is bespeaking and preparing them for a better State.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is an Husband, a Wife, or dear Children dead, and with them the comfort of life laid in the dust? Why this the Lord sees necessary to do, to perswade you to come after willingly? 'Tis the cutting asunder thy roots in the earth, that thou maist fall the more easily. O how many stroaks must God give, at our Names, Estates, Relations, and Health; before we will give way to the last stroak of death that fells us to the ground?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Do the times frown upon Religion? Do all things seem to threaten stormy times at hand? Are desireable Assemblies scattered? Nothing but Sorrows and Sufferings to be expected in this World? By these things God
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63760:91"/>
will imbitter the earth, and sweeten Heaven to his People.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Is the beauty and sweetness of Christian Society defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and decayed? That Communion which was wont to be Pithy, Substantial, Spiritual and Edifying; becomes either frothy or contentious, so that thy Soul hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in it? This also is a weaning Providence to our Souls. <hi>Strigelius</hi> desired to die, that he might be freed <hi>ab implacabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus Theologorum odiis,</hi> from the Wranglings and Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were in his time. Our fond affection to the Body requires all this, and much more to wean and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them.</p>

                     <hi>HOW Comfortable is the Doctrine of the Resurrection to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, which assures them of receiving their Bodies again, though they part with them for a time!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Believers must die as well as others: their Union with Christ priviledges them not from a Separation from their Bodies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10 <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. But yet, they have special grounds of Consolation against this doleful separation above all others. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though they part with them, yet they part in hopes of receiving them again, 1 <hi>Thessal.</hi> 4.13, 14. They take not a final leave of them when they die. Husbandmen cast their Seed-corn into the earth chearfully and willingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they part with it in hope; so should we; when we commit our Bodies to the earth at death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though death separate these dear Friends from each other; yet it cannot separate either the one or other from Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.37, 38. <hi>I am the God of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. Your very dust is the Lords, and the Grave rots not the Bond of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:63760:92"/>3. The very same Body we lay down at death, we shall assume again at the Resurrection. Not only the same <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical,</hi> but the same <hi>Numerical</hi> Body, <hi>Iob</hi> 19.25.26. <hi>With these eyes shall I see God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The unbodied Soul shall not find the want of its Body, so as to afflict or disquiet it, nor the Body the want of its Soul; but the one shall be at rest in Heaven, and the other sweet asleep in the Grave, and all that long interval shall slide away, without any afflicting sense of each others ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. The time will be long, <hi>Iob</hi> 14.12. but if it were longer, it cannot be afflicting, considering how the Soul is cloathed immediately 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2. and how the Body sleeps sweetly in Jesus, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.14.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When the day of their re-espousals is come, the Soul will find the Body so transformed and improved, that it shall never receive prejudice from it any more, but a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler addition to its Happiness and Glory. Now it clogs us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41. The Spirit indeed is willing, but the Flesh is weak. It incumbers us with cares to provide for it: and eats up time and thoughts; but then it will be a Spiritual Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.43. like to the <hi>Angels,</hi> for manner of subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.35, 36. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13. and which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est step of glory, like unto Christs glorious Body, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.21. well therefore might the Father say, <hi>Resurrectio mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuorum, est Consolatio Christianorum: The Resurrection of the Dead, is the Consolation of Christians.</hi>

            <head>USE II. Of Reproof.</head>
            <p>IN the next place let me press you to regulate your love to your Bodies, by the rules of Religion and right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: I must press you to love them, though Nature it self teacheth you so to do; but I press you to love them as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, as men that understand the right use and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Bodies. There are <hi>two</hi> sorts of errours in our love to the Body, one in <hi>Defect,</hi> the other in <hi>Excess</hi>: both come fitly here to be censured and healed.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Some there be that offend in the <hi>Defect</hi> of love to their own Bodies, who use them as if they had no love for them, whose Souls act as if they were enemies to their own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. They do not <hi>formally</hi> and directly hate them, but consequentially and <hi>eventually</hi> they may be said to hate them, and that</p>
            <p n="1">(1) By defiling them with filthy lusts, so the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. Every sin that a man doth, is without the Body, but he that <hi>committeth Adultery</hi> sinneth against his own Body: in other sins, 'tis the Instrument, but here 'tis both Instrument and Object; not only God, but your own Bodies are abused, and wronged by it. The Body may be considered <hi>two</hi> ways, either
<list>
                  <item>1. As our Vessels, or,</item>
                  <item>2. As the Spirits Temple.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:63760:93"/>1. As our <hi>Vessel</hi> or Instrument for natural and Spiritual U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Services: and on that account we should not injure or defile it, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.4, 5. but possess it in sanctification and honour. The lusts of Uncleanness, Gluttony, and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness quench the vigour; blast the beauty, and destroy the health and honour of the Body; and so render it both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and morally unfit for the service and use of the Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And the injury is yet greater, if we consider it as the Spirits <hi>Temple.</hi> On this ground the Apostle strongly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, and disswadeth Christians from these abuses of the <hi>Body,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15, 16. He argues from the Dignity God will put upon our Bodies by the Resurrection, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. They are to be transformed, and made like unto Christs glorious Body: and from the honour he hath already put upon the Bodies of the Saints, in their union with Christ, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. They, as well as the Soul, are ingrafted into him, and joyned with him; they are his Temples, to be dedicated, hallowed, and consecrated to his service. O let them not be made a <hi>sink</hi> for lusts, or meer strainers for meat and drink.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) By <hi>macerating</hi> them with covetous lusts, denying them their due comforts and refreshments, and unmercifully bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening them with labours and sorrows about things that perish. (1) Some deny their Bodies due comforts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshments, which the natural and positive Laws of God both allow and command. Their Souls are cruel Step-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to their bodies, and keep them too short; not out of a prudent and Christian design to starve their lusts, but to advance their estates. Of this evil <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 6.22. <hi>There is an evil which I have seen under the Sun, and it is common among men; A man to whom God hath given riches, Wealth, and Honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his Soul, of all that he desireth; yet God giveth him not power to eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but a stranger eateth it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease. Tenacity</hi> is a disease of the Soul, like that of a <hi>Dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy</hi> in the stomach, which so indisposeth it, that it cannot receive with any appetite or delight the best refreshments at a plentiful Table. (2) And others there are that wrong and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63760:93"/>
abuse their own bodies by laying unreasonable and unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful loads upon them, especially loads of grief and sorrow, wasting and weakning them beyond all rules of reason or Religion. If a friend or relation die, they have less mercy on their own Bodies, than a conscientious man hath on the Horse he rides. Cares and sorrows are as deadly to the Body as a Sword, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.10. Intense and immoderate griefs about Worldly losses and crosses have slain their ten thousands: and which is strange, the Soul seems to take a certain kind of pleasure in loading and tormenting the Body. There is a real truth in that strange expression of <hi>Seneca,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Inest quiddam dulce tristitiae,</hi> Senec. Ep. 806.</note> Sorrow it self hath a certain kind of pleasure attending it.</p>
            <p>The Souls of some mourners do willingly excite and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke their own griefs, when they begin to abate, which is like the whetting of the knife that grows dull, to make it cut the deeper into the Body.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cum occurrant Sermones corum jucundi, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satio hilaris, officiosa pietas; tunc ocali ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut in gaudio relaxantur.</hi> Sen. Ep. 806.</note> Thus, as <hi>Seneca</hi> observes, Some Parents that have lost their beloved children, willingly call to mind their pleasant sayings, and pretty actions, to find a kind of pleasure in a fresh shower of tears for them; when, poor hearts! sorrow hath so broken them already, that they need consolations under their present sorrows, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than irritations of new ones. And the Souls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulness to the Body, is in such cases farther discovered by its obstinate refusal of all that is comforting and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: So it is said of <hi>Rachel,</hi> Jerem. 31.15. <hi>Rachel weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her children, would not be comforted, because they were not.</hi> So the <hi>Israelites</hi> hearkened not unto <hi>Moses,</hi> because of the anguish of spirit, and the cruel bondage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. Thus we studiously rake together, and exasperate whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is piercing, wounding, and over-whelming; and shut our ears to all that is relieving and supporting, which is cruelty to our own Bodies, and that which hath so far bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the health and strength of some bodies, that they are never like to be useful instruments to the Soul any more in this World. Such deep and desperate wounds have their own Souls given them by immoderate grief, as will never be perfectly healed, but by the Resurrection. Of those wounds the body may say as it is <hi>Zeth.</hi> 13.6. These are the wounds with which I was wounded in the house (or
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63760:94"/>
by the hand) of my friend: thus my own Soul hath dealt cruelly and unmercifully with me.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Others offend in the <hi>Excess</hi> and extravagancy of their love to the Body, and these are an hundred to one in number with those that sin in defect of love. My friends, upon a due search it will be found, that the love of our Souls generally degenerates into fondness and folly: There is but little well tempered and ordinate love found among men. We make fondlings, yea, we make <hi>Idols</hi> of our own Bodies, we rob God, yea our own Souls, to give to the Body. It is not a natural and kindly heat of love, but a meer feavourish heat which preys upon the very Spirits of Religion, which is found with many of us. This feavourish distemper may be discovered by the beating of our pulse in three or four particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) This appears by our sinful indulgence to our whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning appetites; We give the flesh whatsoever it craves, and can deny it nothing it desires; pampering the Body, to the great injury and hazard of the Soul. Some have their conversation in the lusts of the flesh, as it is <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. Trading only in those things that please and pamper the flesh: <hi>They sow to the flesh, Gal.</hi> 6.8. (<hi>i.e.</hi>) all their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and labours are but the <hi>sowing of the seeds of pleasure to the flesh.</hi> Not an handful of spiritual Seed sowen in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the Soul all the day long; what the Body craves, the obsequious Soul like a slave, is at its beck to give it. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Serving diverse lusts and pleasures,</hi> attending to every knock and call, to fulfil the desires of the flesh: O how little do these men understand the life of Religion, or the great design of Christianity! which consists in mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not pampering and gratifying the Body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 13, 14. And according to that rule all serious Christians order their Bodies, giving them what is needful to keep them serviceable and useful to the Soul, but not gratifying their irregular desires: giving what their <hi>wants,</hi> not what their <hi>wantonness</hi> calls for. So <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. I beat it down, and keep it under; he understood it as his <hi>Servant,</hi> not his <hi>Master.</hi> He knew that <hi>Hagar</hi> would quickly peark up, and domineer over <hi>Sarah,</hi> expect more attendance than

But how little are many acquainted with these things? They deal with their Bodies as <hi>David</hi> with <hi>Adonijah,</hi> of whom it's said, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.6. His Father had not displeased him at any time, in saying, Why hast thou done so? And just so our flesh requites us by its Rebellions and Treasons against the Soul: it seeks the life of the Soul, which seeks nothing more than its content and pleasure; this is not ordinate love, but fondness and folly, and what we shall bitterly repent for at last.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It appears by our sparing and favouring of them, in the necessary uses and services we have for them in Religion. Many will rather starve their Souls, than work and exercise their Bodies, or disturb their sluggish rest: thus the idle excuses and pretences of endangering our health, oftentimes put by the duties of Religion, or at least lose the fittest and properest season for them: We are lazying upon our beds, when we should be wrestling upon our knees: The World is suffered to get the start of Religion in the morning, and so Religion is never able to overtake it all the day long. This was none of <hi>David</hi>'s course, he prevented the dawning of the morning, and cryed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.147. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord, in the morning will
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63760:95"/>
I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> And indeed we should consecrate unto God the freshest and fittest parts of our time, when our bodily Senses are most vigorous; and we would do so (except God by his providence disable us) were our hearts fully set for God, and Religion lay with weight upon our Spirits.</p>
            <p>Some I confess cannot receive this injunction, being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally disabled by prevailing infirmities, but those tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>O Friends, why hath God given you Bodies, if not to waste and wear them out in his service, and the service of your own Souls? if your Bodies must not be put to it, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised this way, where is the mercy of having a Body? If a stately Horse were given you on this condition, that you must not ride or work him, what benefit would such a gift be to you? Your Bodies must, and will wear out, and it's better wear them with working, than with rusting: we are generally more sollicitous to live long, than to live use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and serviceably, and it may be our health had been more precious in the eyes of God, if it had been less pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in our own eyes? 'Tis just with God to destroy that health with diseases, which he sees we would cast away in slothfulness and idleness. Think with thy self, had such a Soul as <hi>Timothies</hi> or <hi>Gaius</hi>'s been blessed with such a Body as thine, so strong and vigorous, so apt and able for service, they would have honoured God more in it, in a day, than perhaps you do in a year. Certainly, this is not love, but laziness, not a due improvement, but a sinful neglect and abuse of the Body, to let it rust out in idleness, which might be imployed so many ways for God, for your own and others Souls. Well, remember death will shortly dissolve them, and then they can be of no more use; and if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect God should put glory and honour upon them at the Resurrection, use them for God now, with a faithful self-denying diligence.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:63760:95"/>(3.)

               </gap>t sufferings are prepared for the fearful and unbelieving in the World to come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sad examples do the Church-Histories of ancient and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times afford us, of men who consulting with flesh and bloud in time of danger, have in pity to the Body ruined their Souls?</p>
            <p>There be but few like minded with <hi>Paul,</hi> who set a low price upon his liberty or life for Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.24. or with those worthy <hi>Iews, Dan.</hi> 3.28. who yielded their <hi>Bodies</hi> to preserve their <hi>consciences.</hi> Few of <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> mind who told the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, Nil nisi peccatum timeo,</hi> I fear nothing but sin; Or of <hi>Basils,</hi> who told the <hi>Emperor,</hi> God threatned Hell, whereas he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but a prison. That is a remarkable Rule that Christ gives us <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. The sum of it is, to set God against man, the Soul against the Body, and Hell against temporal suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and so surmounting these low fleshly considerations, to cleave to our duty in the face of dangers. You read <hi>Gal.</hi> 11 16. how in pursuit of Duty, though surrounded with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>Paul</hi> would not conferr or <hi>consult with flesh and bloud,</hi> (i. e.) ask its opinion which were best, or stay for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent till it were willing to suffer; he understood not that the flesh had any voice at the Council-table in his Soul, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or unwilling, if duty call for it, he was resolved to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard it for God.</p>
            <p>We have a great many little <hi>Politicians</hi> among us, who think to husband their lives and liberties a great deal better than other plain-hearted and too forward Christians do; but these <hi>Politiques</hi> will be their <hi>perdition,</hi> and their craft will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them to ruine. They will lose their lives by saving them, when others will save them by losing them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.39. For the interest of the Body depends on and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the safety of the Soul, as the Cabin doth the ship.</p>
            <p>O my Friends, let me beg you not to love your Bodies into Hell, and your Souls too for their sakes: be not so
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63760:96"/>
scar'd at the sufferings of the Body, as with poor <hi>Spira</hi> to dash them both against the wrath of the great and terrible God. Most of those Souls that are now in Hell, are there upon the account of their indulgence to the flesh: they could not deny the flesh, and now are denyed by God. They could not suffer from men, and now must suffer the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of eternal fire.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) In a word, it appears we love them fondly and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, in that we cannot with any patience think of death and separation from them. How do some men fright at the very name of death? and no Arguments can perswade them seriously to think of an unbodied and separated estate. 'Tis as death to them, to bring their thoughts close to that ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subject. A Christian that loves his Body regularly and moderately, can look into his own grave with a composed mind, and speak familiarly of it, as <hi>Iob</hi> 17.14. And <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of the putting off of his Body by death, as a man would of the putting off of his cloaths at night, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13, 14. And certainly such men have a great Advantage above all others, both as to the tranquillity of their life and death. You know a parting time must come, and the more fond you are of them, the more bitter and doleful that time will be. Nothing except the guilt, and terrible charges of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, put men into terrours at death, more than our fondness of the Body. I do confess, Christless persons have a great deal of reason to be shie of death: their dying day is their undoing day: but for Christians to startle and fright at it, is strange, considering how great a friend death will be to them that are in Christ. What are you afraid of? What, to go to Christ? to be freed of sin and affliction too soon? Certainly, it hath not been so comfortable an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to you, that you should be loth to exchange it for an Heavenly one.</p>

            <p>Souls, if you love your selves, or the Bodies you dwell in, shew it by your preventing care in season, lest they be cast away for ever. How can you say you love them, when you daily expose them to the everlasting wrath of God, by imploying them as weapons of unrighteousness, to fight against him that formed them? You feed and pamper them on earth, you give them all the delights and pleasures you can procure for them in this World, but you take no care what shall become of them, nor your Souls neither after death hath separated them. O cruel Souls, cruel not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but to your selves, and to your own flesh, which you pretend so much love to! Is this your love to your Bodies, what, to imploy them in Satans service on Earth, and then to be cast as a prey to him for ever in Hell? You think the rigor and mortification of the Saints, their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemiousness and self-denial, their cares, fears, and diligence, to be too great severity to their Bodies, but they know, these are the most real evidences of their true love to them; they love them too well to cast them away as you do.

The Soul should look upon the Body as a wise Parent upon a rebellious or wanton child, that would (if left to it self) quickly bring it self to the <hi>Gallows</hi>; The Father looks on him with compassion and melting bowels, and saith, with the rod in his hand, and tears in his eyes, my child, my naughty, disobedient, headstrong child, I resolve to chastise thee severely, I love thee too well to suffer thee to be ruin'd, if my care or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections may prevent it.

He well knew what a sleepy disease the best Christians are troubled with, and therefore he had need to be stirring them up, and awakening them to their duty. (2) The <hi>constancy</hi> of his work, <hi>as long as I am in this Tabernacle: (i. e.)</hi> as long as I live in this World. The Body is here called a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> in respect of its move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness and frailty, and in opposition to that house made without hands, eternal in the Heavens. And it is observeable how he limits and bounds his serviceableness to them, by his commoration in his Tabernacle or Body, as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after death he could be no longer useful to them or any others in this World. Death puts an end to all our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial usefulness: but till that time, he judged it meet and becoming him, to be aiding and assisting their faith: Our life and labour must end together.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We have here the Motive or consideration stimulating and provoking him to this diligence, knowing that I must shortly <hi>put off this Tabernacle, even as the Lord Iesus Christ hath shewed me:</hi> in which words he gives an account of (1) The speediness, (2) Necessity, (3) Voluntariness of his death, and the way and means by which he knew it. All these must be considered singly and apart, and then valued altogether as they amount to a weighty Argument or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to excite him to diligence in his his duty.</p>

            <p n="2">(2.)

And besides this, most Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors think this clause refers to some special vision or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which <hi>Peter</hi> had of the time and manner of his own death: so that besides the natural necessity or the inevitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his death by the law of Nature; he was certified of it by special Revelation. We have here also</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The voluntariness of his death, for voluntariness is consistent enough with the necessity of the event.<note place="margin">

            <p>Upon the consideration of the whole matter, the speediness of his death, which he knew to be at hand, the Necessity of it, that when it came he must be gone from them, and could be no more useful to them, and his own inclination to be with Christ in a better state, being as willing to be gone as a weary Traveller to be at home; he judged it meet, or becoming him, as he was called of Christ to feed his sheep, as he was gifted extraordinarily for the Churches service, full of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual excellencies, all which in a short time would be taken away from them by death: I say, upon all these accounts he could not but judge it meet to be stirring them up, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way striving to be as useful as he might.</p>

               <p>The Law of Mortality binds all, good and bad, young and old, the most useful and desirable Saints, whom the World can worst spare, as well as useless and undesire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. and if Christ (or though Christ) be in you, the Body is dead because of sin, <hi>Peter</hi> himself must put off his Tabernacle, for they are but Tabernacles, frail and moveable frames, not built for continuance: these will drop off from our Souls, as the Shell falls of from the Bird in the Nest: be our earthly Tabernacles never so strong or pleasant,<note n="(2)" place="margin">The speediness of death.

Though he be in glory, yet his Mystical Body is not full, till all the elect be gathered in by Conversion, and gathered home by glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.23. The Church is his fulness. He is not fully satisfied, till he see his seed, the Souls he died for, safe in Heaven; and then the debt due to him for all his Sufferings is fully paid him, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.11. He sees the travel of his Soul. As it is the greatest satisfaction and pleasure a man is capable of in this World, to see a great design which hath been long projecting, and mannaging, at last by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly conduct brought to its perfection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The desires of the Saints are hereby satisfied, and their weary Souls brought to rest. O what do gracious Souls more pant after than the full Enjoyment of God, and the Visions of his face! The state of freedom from sin, and compleat Conformity to Jesus Christ! From the day of their Espousals to Christ, these desires have been work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Souls. Love and Patience have each acted its part in them, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.5. Love hath put them into an holy ardor and longing to be with Christ; Patience hath quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and allayed those desires, and supported the Soul under the delay. Love cries, Come Lord, come. Patience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to wait the appointed time. This appointed time on which so great hopes and expectations depend, is the time of dissolving these Tabernacles; for till then, the Souls Rest is suspended: And if it were perfectly freed from all other Loads and Burdens, both of sin and affliction, yet its very absence from Christ, would alone make it rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. For it is with the Soul in the Body, as it is with any other Creature that is off its Centre, it doth, and must gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate and propend, it is still moving and inclining further, and feels not it self easie, and at rest, where it is, be its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in other respects never so easie. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. Whilst we
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63760:101"/>
are at home in the Body, we are absent from the Lord: You have a little shadow or Emblem of this in other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: You see the Rivers though they glide never so sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, betwixt the fragrant banks of the most pleasant Meadows in their Course and Passage, yet on they go towards the Sea, and if they meet with never so many Rocks or Hills to resist their course<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will either strive to get a Passage through them, or if that may not be, they will fetch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass and creep about them, and nothing can stop them till by a central force they have finished their weary Course, and poured themselves into the Bosome of the Ocean. Or as it is with your selves when abroad from your Habitations and Relations, this may be pleasing a little while, but if every day might be a Festival, it would not long please you, because you are not at home.</p>
               <p>The main Motives that perswade a gracious Soul to ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>de here, are to finish the work of their own Salvation, and further other mens, but as their Evidences for Heaven grow clearer to themselves, and their capacity of Service less to others, so must their desires to be with Christ be more and more inflamed.</p>
               <p>Now the case so standing, that Christs condition in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven being a condition of desire and longing for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his people there, and all the Glory of Heaven would not content him without that; and the condition of his people on earth, being also a state of longing, groaning and panting to be with him, and all the Pleasures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Comforts they have on earth, will not content them without it: How wise and gracious an Appointment of Heaven is it, that these our Tabernacles shall and must be put off, and that shortly! For hereby a full and mutual satisfaction is given to the restless desires both of Christs heart and of theirs. See the reflected flames of love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them in <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride say, Come, and let him that is a thirst come; Behold I come quickly, even so Lord Iesus come quickly.</hi> Delays make the heart sad, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.12. Should our Commoration on earth be long, our Patience had need be much greater than it is; but under all our burdens here, this is our relief, it is but a little while and all will be well, as well as our Souls can desire to have it.</p>

                  <p>MUst we put off these Tabernacles? Is death necessary and inevitable? <hi>Then 'tis our wisdom to sweeten to our selves that Cup which we must drink, and make that as pleasant to us as we can, which we know cannot be avoided.</hi> Die we must, whether we be fit or unfit, willing or unwilling: 'tis to no purpose to shrug at the name, or shrink back from the thing. In all Ages of the World death hath swept the Stage clean of one Generation, to make room for another, and so it will from Age to Age, till the Stage be taken down in the general dissolution.</p>
                  <p>But though death be inevitable by all, it is not alike evil, bitter and dreadful to all. Some <hi>tremble,</hi> others <hi>triumph</hi> at the appearance of it. Some meet it half way, receive it as a friend, and can bid it welcome, and die by consent, making that the matter of their Election, which in it self is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and unavoidable; so did <hi>Paul, Philip.</hi> 1.23. but others are drawn or rent by plain violence from the Body, <hi>Iob</hi> 27.8. when God draws out his Soul.</p>
                  <p>That man is happy indeed, whose heart falls in with the Appointment of God, so voluntarily and freely, as that he dare not only look death in the face with confidence, but go along with it by consent of will. Remarkable to this purpose is that which the Apostle asserts of the frame of his own heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. <hi>We are confident, I say, and willing, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be absent from the Body, and present with the Lord.</hi> Here is both <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Complacence,</hi> with respect to death. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The word signifies Courage, Fortitude, or if you will, an undaunted boldness and presence of mind, when we look the King of Terrours in the face. We dare venture upon death, we dare take it by the cold hand, and bid it welcome. We dare defie its Enmity, and deride its noxious power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>O Death, where is thy sting?</hi> And that's not all, we have Complacence in it, as well as Confidence to encounter it. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. We are willing, the Translation is too flat, we are well pleased, it is a desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and grateful thing to us, to die: But yet not in an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63760:102"/>
but comparative Consideration, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we are willing rather, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) rather than not see and enjoy our Lord Jesus Christ: rather than to be here always sinning and groaning. There is no Complacency in death, in it self, it is not desirable. But if we must go through that strait gate, or not see God; we are willing rather to be absent from the Body. So that you see, death was not the matter of his submission only, he did not yield to what he could not avoid, but he ballances the evils of death, with the Priviledges it admits the Soul into, and then pronounces, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we are content, yea, pleased to die.</p>
                  <p>We cannot live always if we would, and our hearts should be wrought to that frame, as to say, we would not live always if we could. <hi>Iob</hi> 7.16. <hi>I would not live always or long,</hi> saith he. But why should <hi>Iob</hi> deprecate that which was not attainable? I would not live alway; he needed not to trouble himself about that, it being impossible that he should; both Statute and Natural Law forbid it. Ay, but this is his sense, supposing no such Necessity as there is, if it were pure matter of Election: Upon a due ballancing of the accounts, and comparing the good and evil of death, I would not be confined always, or for any long time to the Body: It would be a bondage unsupportable to be here always.</p>
                  <p>Indeed those that have their Portion, their All, in this life, have no desire to be gone hence. They that were never changed by grace, desire no change by death; if such a Concession were made to them, as was once to an <hi>English</hi> Parliament, that they should never be dissolved, but by their own consent, when would they say as <hi>Paul, I desire to be dissolved?</hi> But it's far otherwise with them whose portion and affections are in another World, they would not live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways if they might, knowing, that never to die, is never to be happy.</p>

                  <p>I know it's a common presumption of most men, that they shall be in Heaven, when they can be no longer on earth. <hi>Praesumendo sperant, &amp; sperando pereunt.</hi> But a few moments will convince them of their fatal mistake; their poor Souls will meet with a confounding repulse like that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. There is indeed a City full of heavenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions prepared for some, but who are they that are intitled to it, and may confidently expect to be received into it?

if not renewed by grace, there's no hope of Glory. You must be born again, or turned back again from the Gates of Heaven disappointed. You must be regenerated or damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This alters the temper of thy heart, and suits it to the life of God, which is indispensably necessary to them that shall live with him. Else Heaven would be no Heaven to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. and therefore we must be wrought this way to it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 5. No Priviledge of Nature, no Duties of Religion avail without this, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. If Morality without Regeneration could bring men to Heaven, Why are not the Heathens there? If strictness in Duty without Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Why not the Pharisees there? Believe it, neither Names, nor Duties, no nor the Blood of Christ, ever did, or shall bring one Soul to glory without it. O then thou that boastest of an house in Heaven, lay thine hand on thy heart and ask it; Am I a new Creature, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) Am I renewed (1) in my state and condition? 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14. past from death to life.

It implies the firm credit that a Believer gives to things unseen, upon the grounds of the promises, as if he did sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly take and grasp them in his very arms and bosome. They take Christ, and all the invisible things in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses into their sensible embraces, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. faith is to them instead of eyes.</item>
                        <item>(3) It implies the sincerity of a Believers profession, who dare trust to that at last gasp, which he professed to believe in the midst of life, and the Comforts of this World. As he professed to believe in health, so you shall find his Actings, when his eye and heart strings are cracking, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. Christ in the promises was his professed joy in life, and this is what he grasps at death, and lays his last hold on.</item>

O 'tis from the promises, Christ in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises is the Spring of their Consolation. This they fetch their comfort from, when the World cannot administer one drop of refreshment to them. There be two great works faith performs for the Saints, one in life, the other in death. In life, it is the Principle of Mortification to their sins, in death, it is the spring of Consolation to their hearts: It makes them die whilst they live, and live when they die.</item>

(2) Supream, and above all other beloveds. (3) Conforming the Soul to Christ; if sincere and supream, it will be transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. (4) Longing to be with him.

                     <item>(6) As soon as ever time shall end, Eternity takes place. The stream of time delivers Souls daily into the boundless Ocean of vast Eternity. <hi>Ab hoc momento pendet aeternitas.</hi> We are now measured by time, hereafter by eternity.</item>

If they did, (1) The Unregenerate would not so desperately hazard their eternal happiness, by trifling away their precious Seasons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel. O how many aged sinners, gray-headed sinners hear me this day, who in fifty or sixty years never redeemed one solemn hour to take their poor Souls aside out of the clutter and distracting noise of the World, to ask and debate this question with them, O my Soul, how stands the case with thee in reference to the World to come? They have found no time to bethink themselves, in what World their Souls shall be landed, when time shall deliver them up into Eternity. Their whole life hath been but a continual diversion from one trifle to another; They have been seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in trifles, and trifled in things most serious, this will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford horrid reflections in the World to come.

May I not say to you, as the Apostle doth, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.12. for the time you have had under the Gospel, you might have attained a rich treasure both of Grace and Comfort; <hi>Turpe est senex elementarius.</hi> Is it not shameful and inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, to be where you were twenty years past: O let these things sink deep into every Soul.</item>

                  <p>O the multitude of thoughts and cares this World need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessly devours!

How heavy soever their burden be, yet they shall carry it but a little way.</hi> It's said 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 4. We that are in this Tabernacle do groan, being burdened. Good Souls in this State are every where groaning under heavy pressures. Their burdens are of two sorts, <hi>Sympathetical,</hi> whereby they grieve with, and on the account of others, and so every true member of the Church of God ought to sympathize, both with God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1 39.21. <hi>Am not I grieved with them that rise up against thee?</hi> Psal. 42.10. it is as with a Sword in their bones; and with the people of God, <hi>Zeph</hi> 3.18. sorrowful for the solemn Assembly, so 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Who is offended and I burn not?</hi> And indeed, it is an Argument of rich, as well as true grace, that we can, and do heartily mourn with, and for the Interest and People of God, though our own lot in the World, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s, be never so comfortable. Or else our burdens are <hi>Idiopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical (i. e.)</hi> such as we bear upon our own proper account and score: And where is the Christian that hath not his own burden, yea, many burthens on him at once? Some groan under the burden of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. Scarce one day are the tears off some eye-lids on this account. And who groans not under the burden of affliction, either <hi>inward</hi> upon the Soul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. <hi>Iob</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. or <hi>outward</hi> upon the Body, State, Relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These things make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God a burthen to themselves, <hi>Iob</hi> 7.20, 21. Yea, under these burthens they would sink, did not the Lord sustain them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55.22.</p>
                  <p>But God will put a speedy and final end to all these things; when you put off this Tabernacle, you put off with it all those burdens, inward, and outward. The Soul presently feels a great load off its shoulders: It shall never groan more, God shall thenceforth wipe away all tears from their eyes: For why are those burdens now permitted and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Lord upon you, but (1) To prevent sin, <hi>Hosea</hi> 2.6.

You know the time is at hand that you shall live above all bodily concernments and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Soul shall be a drudge to the Body no more. You shall be as the Angels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.30. not marrying nor given in Marriage, which is <hi>Synecdochically</hi> put for all Carnal Imployments, and Enjoyments; eat no more, drink no more, sleep no more; buy and sell no more. Now suit your selves as much as your State, and the Duties of Religion will suffer you, to that State before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. The summ of what I aim at is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30. Be in all your Relations, as if you had none. Look on

those things as if already they were not, which shortly must be none of yours, and both acquaint and accustome your thoughts to the life of separation from the Body, which you must shortly live, which brings me home to the next point, <hi>viz.</hi> The Condition of Humane Souls in the State of Separation.</p>

            <p>THE particular scope of this context falls in with the general design of the whole Gospel, which is to perswade men to a life of Holiness. The <hi>matter</hi> of the exhortation is most <hi>weighty,</hi> and the <hi>Arguments</hi> inforcing it most <hi>powerful</hi>: he doth not talk, but dispute; he doth not say, but prove that greater and more powerful engagements unto holiness lye upon those who live under the Gospel, than upon the people who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under the Law. And thus the Argument lies in this <hi>Context.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God at the delivering of the Law upon <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> strictly enjoyned and required so great Purity and Holiness in that people,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.10.</note> signified by the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of two days pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, the washing of their cloaths, abstinence from conjugal society, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> much more doth he require and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it in us who are come under a much more excellent and Heavenly dispensation than theirs was.</p>
            <p>To make good the <hi>sequel,</hi> he compares the <hi>legal</hi> and the evangelical Dispensations in many particulars, <hi>verse</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. giving the Gospel the preference through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole <hi>Collation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In summ, the priviledges of the New Testament-Believers are here stated, both <hi>negatively,</hi> and <hi>positively.</hi>

               <hi>First, Negatively,</hi> What we are exempted or freed from, <hi>verse</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>We are not come unto the Mount that might be touched,</hi> &amp;c. The summ of all is this, that the promulgation of the Law was accompanied with amazing dread and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. For after <hi>Moses</hi> by command from God had sanctified the <hi>Mount,</hi> and set <hi>Rails</hi> about it, that neither <hi>Priest,</hi> nor <hi>People,</hi> Man nor Beast, might touch the very borders of it, lest they dye: the Lord descended in fire upon the top of the <hi>Mountain</hi> the third day in the morning, with most terrible tokens of Divine Majesty, <hi>sc.</hi> with Thundrings, Lightnings, dark clouds, and the noise of a <hi>Trumpet</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding loud; the <hi>Mount</hi> was covered with smoak, as the smoak of a Furnace, and flames mounting up unto the midst of Heaven,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Crebris micat ignibus ather.</hi>
               </note> the whole Mountain shaking and trembling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly: out of this horrid Tempest the awful voice of God was heard, all the people in the <hi>Camp</hi> trembling, yea and <hi>Moses</hi> himself quaking for fear.</p>
            <p>This was the manner of the Laws Promulgation: but to such a terrible Dispensation as this we are not come, which is the negative part of our priviledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He opens the positive priviledges, to which we are come.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Ye are come,</hi> (saith he) <hi>to mount Sion,</hi> not the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the Spiritual <hi>Sion. Mount Sion</hi> was the place cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated above all the World for the Worship of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 87.7. <hi>All my springs</hi> (saith God) <hi>are in thee.</hi> There was the Temple, the Ark of the Covenant, the glory of the Lord dwelling between the <hi>Cherubims.</hi> The <hi>Priests</hi> that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the service of God, had their residence there, as the Angels have in Heaven. Thither the Tribes went up from all quarters of <hi>Iudea, Psal.</hi> 84. as the children of God now do to Heaven from all Quarters of the World. <hi>Iudea</hi> was the best Kingdom in the World; <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the best City in that Kingdom; and <hi>Sion</hi> the most glorious place in that City. Here Christ taught his heavenly Doctrine; near
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63760:109"/>
to it he finished his glorious work of Redemption. Hence, the everlasting Gospel went forth into all the world: and on these considerations its put to signifie the Gospel-Church or State in this place, and is therefore called <hi>the heavenly Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> in the following words. We do not come to the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Sion,</hi> nor to the <hi>earthly Ierusalem</hi>; but to the Gospel Church, or State, which may be called an Heaven upon earth, compared with that <hi>literal Ierusalem.</hi>

It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a great Assembly comprizing the Believers of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under Heaven; and so speaking of them <hi>collectively,</hi> it is the general convention or Assembly, which is also dignified and ennobled by two illustrious characters, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) that it is <hi>the Church of the first-born,</hi> (i. e.) consisting of Members dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and priviledged above others,<note place="margin">

Christ, who hath carried our nature into the very midst of them, and whom they all behold, with highest admiration and delight.

               <head>DOCT. That righteous and holy Souls once separated from then Bodies by death, are immediately perfected in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and associated with others alike perfect in the Kingdom of God.</head>
               <p>THAT the Spirits of just Men at the time of their sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from their Bodies do not utterly fall in their beings, nor that they are so prejudiced and wounded by death that they cannot exert their own proper Acts in the absence of the Body, hath been already cleared in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going parts of this Treatise, and will be more fully cleared from this Text.</p>

                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:63760:111"/>But the true level and aim of this discourse is at an higher mark, <hi>viz</hi> the far more excellent, free and noble life the Souls of the just begin to live immediately after their Bodies are dropt off from them by death, at which time they begin to live like themselves, a pleasant free and divine life. So much at least is included in the <hi>Apostle Epithete</hi> in my Text, Spirits of the just made <hi>perfect,</hi> and suitable thereto are his words in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10.12. <hi>When that which is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>These two <hi>Adverbs, Now,</hi> and <hi>Then,</hi> distinguish the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold state of gracious Souls, and shew what it is whilst they are confined in the Body, and what it shall be from the time of their emancipation and freedom from that clogg of mortality. <hi>Now</hi> we are <hi>imperfect,</hi> but <hi>then</hi> that which is perfect takes place, and that which is imperfect is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; as the imperfect twilight is done away, by the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the perfect day.</p>
               <p>And it deserves a serious animadversion, that this perfect State doth not succeed the imperfect one, after a long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval (as long as betwixt the dissolution, and Resurrection of the Body) but the imperfect state of the Soul, is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately done away by the coming of the perfect one. The glass is laid by as useless, when we come to see face to face, and eye to eye.</p>
               <p>The Waters will prove very deep here, too deep for any line of mine to fathom, there is a cloud always oversha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing the world to come, a gloom and haziness upon that state; fain we would with our weak and feeble beam of imperfect knowledge penetrate this cloud, and dispel this gloom and haziness, but cannot: we think seriously and close to this great and awful subject, but our thoughts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pierce through it; we re-inforce those thoughts by a salley or thick succession of fresh thoughts, and yet all will not do, our thoughts return to us either in confusion, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the expected success.

For hereby we learn to bear it gradually, and by gentle essays to acquaint our shoulders with the burden of it. <hi>Separation</hi> is a word that hath much of horror in the very sound, and useth to have much more in the sense and feeling of it; else it would not deserve that title, <hi>Iob</hi> 8.14. <hi>The King of Terrors,</hi> or the most terrible of all terribles: but acquaintance and familiarity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates that horror, and that two ways especially.</p>

It was once demanded of a very holy man (who spent much more than the ordinary allowance of time in Prayer, and searching his own heart) why he so macerated his own Body by such frequent, and long continued Duties?

There is (saith one) no ponyard in death it self, like those in the way or Prologue to it. I like not <hi>to dye,</hi> said another, but I care not if I <hi>were dead</hi>; the end is better than the way.

                        <item>4. The way and manner of its converse with, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God is changed. There are two <hi>mediums</hi> by which Souls converse with God in the Body, <hi>viz</hi>

                  <p n="1">(1) If a man walk with God on earth, it must be in the use and exercise of Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. nor can there be any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion carried on betwixt God and the Soul without it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) The external <hi>mediums</hi> are the ordinances of God, or duties of Religion, both publick, and private, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.2. Betwixt these two <hi>mediums</hi> of Communion with God, this remarkable difference is sound; the Soul may see and enjoy God by Faith, in the want or absence of Ordinances; but there is no seeing or conversing with God in the greatest plenty and purity of Ordinances, without Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2.</p>
                  <p>But in the same moment the Soul is cut off from union with the Body, it is also cut off from both these ways of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12 <hi>Isai.</hi> 38.11. But yet the Soul is no loser, nay, it is the greatest <hi>Gainer</hi> by this change. The Child is no loser by ceasing to derive its nourishment by the <hi>Navel,</hi> when it comes to receive it by the mouth; a more noble way, whereby it gets a new pleasure in tasting the variety of all delectable Food. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> bemoaned the loss of Ordinances upon his supposed death-bed, saying, <hi>I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord in the Land of the living. q. d.</hi> Now farewel <hi>Temple</hi> and Ordinances; I shall never go any more into his Temple where my Soul hath been so often cheared and refresht with the displays of his grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

I shall never more join with the Assembly of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on earth: And suppose he had not, sure he would have lost nothing, had he then exchanged the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for the Temple in Heaven, and Communion with sinful imperfect Saints on earth, for fellowship with Angels, and <hi>the Spirits of just men made perfect.</hi> By this change we lose no more than he loseth, who whilst he stands delightfully contemplating the image of his dearest friend in a glass, hath the glass snatcht away by his friend, whom he now seeth face to face.</p>

                  <p n="2">(2) They are also more sweet and ravishing. As our Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, so are our Pleasures: Perfect Visions produce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Pleasures. The faculties of the Soul now, and never till now, lie level to that rule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37. The Visions of God command and call forth all the heart and soul, mind, and strength, into acts of love and delight. It was not so here, if the Spirit were willing, the Flesh was weak, but there the clog is off from the foot of the Will.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) More constant, fixed, and steddy. 'Tis one of the greatest difficulties in Religion, to fix the thoughts, and cure the wildness and roveings of the fancy. The heart is not steddy with God, and hence are its ups and downs,

The dread of Angels naturally falls upon our Animal Spirits: They shrink and tremble at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Spirits; not only the Spirits of Men, but of Beasts, quail at it. A Dog or an Horse is terrified at it, as well as a Man, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.25. The dread of Spirits strikes the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, or natural Spirits, primarily; and the mind or rational Soul by consent. There is also another cause of fear in man, upon the sight or presence of <hi>Angels, viz.</hi> A Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of guilt. Whereever there is guilt, there will be fear, especially upon any extraordinary appearance

of God to us, though it be but imediately, by an Angel.</p>
                  <p>But when the Soul is freed both from flesh, and sin; and shall enjoy it self in a nature like to these pure and holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the dread of Angels is then vanished, and the Soul will take great content and satisfaction in their Company and Communion. The Soul then finds it self a fit Companion for them, looks upon them as its fellow Servants, for so they are, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.10. and the Angels look upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of just men, not as Inferiours and Underlings, but with great respect, as Spirits in some sense nearer to Christ than themselves. So that henceforth no dread falls upon us from the presence of these excellent Creatures; but each enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth singular delight in each others Society. And thus we see in what honourable and pleasing Company the souls of the just go hence to their Father's house and bosome.</p>

They act as they are first acted, and so do these bodily Spirits. So that to speak properly, the Body is bettered by the use the Soul makes of it in these its noble actions, but the Soul is not advantaged by being tied to such a Body.

                  <head>PROP. VI. That the separated Souls of the just, having finished all their work of obedience on earth, and the Spirit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving finished all his work of Sanctification upon them, they do ascend to God, with all the habits of Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in them; and all the comfortable improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Graces, accompanying and following them.</head>
                  <p>THis Proposition is to be opened and confirmed in these <hi>four</hi> Branches.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) When a gracious Soul is separated from the Body, all its work of obedience in this World is finished. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death is called <hi>the finishing of our course,</hi> Acts 20.24. the night when man works no more, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.4. There is no working in the grave, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.10. for death dissolves the <hi>Compositum,</hi> and removes the Soul immediately to another World; where it can act for it self only, but not for others, as it was wont to do on earth. <hi>I shall see man no more</hi> (saith <hi>Hezekiah</hi>) <hi>with the Inhabitants of the World,</hi> Isaiah 38.11. that which was said of <hi>David</hi>'s death, is as true of every Christian, that <hi>having served his Generation according to the Will of God, he fell asleep,</hi> Acts 13.36.</p>
                  <p>I do not say this lower World receives no benefit at all by them, after their death; for though they can speak no more, write no more, pray for, and instruct the Inhabitants of this World no more, nor exhibit to them the beauty of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in any new acts or examples of theirs: (which is that I mean by saying they have finished all their work of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on earth) Yet the benefit of what they did whilst in the Body, still remains, after they are gone; as the Apostle speaks of <hi>Abel,</hi> Hebr. 11.4. <hi>Who being dead, yet speaketh.</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:63760:121"/>
This way indeed abundance of service will be done for the Souls of men upon earth, long after they are gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And this should greatly quicken us to leave as much as we can behind us, for the good of Posterity, that <hi>after our decease</hi> (as the Apostle speaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15.) they may have our words and examples in remembrance. But for any service to be done <hi>de novo</hi> after death, it is not to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. We have accomplished as an Hireling our day, and have not a stroke more to do.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) As all our work of obedience is then finished by us, so at death, all the Work of God is finished by his Spirit upon us. The last hand is then put to all the preparatory work for glory; not a stroke more to be done upon it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, which appears as well by the immediate succession of the life of glory, (whereof I shall speak in another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position) as by the cessation of all sanctifying means and instruments, which are totally laid aside as things of no more use, after this stroke is given, <hi>Adepto fine, cessant media,</hi> Means are useless, when the end is attain'd. There is no work, saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the Grave. How short soever the Souls stay and abode in the Body was, though it were regenerated one day, and separated the next; yet all that is wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, which God ever intended should be wrought in this World, and there is no preparation-work in the other World.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) But though the Soul leave all the means of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, yet it carries away with it to Heaven all those ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of grace which were planted and improved in it in this World, by the blessing of the Spirit upon those means: though it leave the Ordinances, it loseth not the effects and fruits of them; though they cease, their effects still live. <hi>The truth dwelleth in us, and shall be in us for ever,</hi> 1 John 2.17. <hi>The Seed of God remaineth in us,</hi> 1 John 3.9.</p>
                  <p>Common gifts fall at death, but saving grace sticks fast in the Soul, and ascends with it into glory. Gracious habits are inseparable; Glory doth not destroy but perfect them. They are the Souls meetness for Heaven, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63760:122"/>
therefore it shall not come into his presence, leaving its meetness behind it. In vain is all the work of the Spirit upon us in this World, if we carry it not along with us into that World, seeing all his works upon us in this life, have a respect and relation to the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Look therefore as the same natural Faculties and Powers which the Soul had, (though it could not use them) in its imperfect Body in the Womb, came with it into this World where they freely exerted themselves in the most noble actions of natural life; so the habits of Grace which by Regeneration are here implanted in a weak and imperfect Soul, go with it to glory, where they exert themselves in a more high and perfect way of acting, than ever they did here below. The languishing spark of love, is there a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment flame; the saint, remiss, and infrequent delight in God, is there at a constant ravishing and transporting height.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) To conclude, As all implanted habits of grace ascend with the sanctified Soul to Heaven; (for the Soul ascends not thither, as a natural, but as a new Creature) so all the effects, results, and sweet improvements of those Graces which we gathered as the pleasant fruits of them on earth; these accompany and follow the Soul into the other World also; <hi>Their Works follow them,</hi> Rev. 14.13. They go not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the notion of merits, to make way for them, but they follow or accompany them, as Evidences, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Experiences. I doubt not, but the very remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what past betwixt God and the Soul here betwixt the day of its Espousals to Christ, and its Divorce from the Body, will be one sweet ingredient into their blessedness and joy, when they shall be singing in the upper Region, the Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> They were never given, to be lost, or left behind us. And thus you see with what a rich <hi>Cargo</hi> the Soul sails to the other World, though if it had no other, it would never drop Anchor there.</p>

                  <head>PROP. VII. The Souls of the just when separated from their Bodies, do not wander up and down this World, nor hover about the Sepulchres where their Bodies lie, nor are they detain'd in any Purgatory, in order to their more perfect Purification; nor do they fall asleep in a benummed, stupid State: But do forthwith pass into glory, and are immediately with the Lord.</head>
                  <p>WHen once the mind of man leaves the Scripture-guidance and direction, which is to it, what the <hi>Compass,</hi> or Pole-star is to a Ship in the wide Ocean; Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it not wander? In what uncertainties will it not fluctuate? And upon what Rocks and Quick-sands must it inevitably be cast? Many have been the foolish and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Conceits and Fancies of men, about the Receptacles of departed Souls.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some have assigned them a restless wandering life, now here, now there; without any certain dwelling place any where. The only ground for this fancy, is the frequent Apparitions of the Ghosts or Spirits of the dead, whereof many instances are given; and who is there that is a stranger to such Stories? Now, if departed Souls were fixed any where, this World would be quiet and free from such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances.</p>
                  <p>I make no doubt but very many of these Stories have been the industrious Fictions and Devices of wicked and superstitious <hi>Votaries</hi> to gain reputation to their way, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lies in Hypocrisie to draw Disciples after them. And many others have been the Tricks and Impostures of Satan himself, to shake the credit of the Saints Rest in Heaven, and the imprisonment of ungodly Souls in Hell, as will
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:63760:123"/>
more fully appear, when I come to speak to that Question more particularly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others think when they are loosed from the Body at death, they hover about the Graves and solitary places where their Bodies lie, as willing, seeing they can dwell no longer in them, to abide as near them as they can; just as the surviving <hi>Turtle,</hi> keeps near the place where his <hi>Mate</hi> died, and may be heard mourning for a long time about that part of the Wood. This opinion seeks countenance and protection from that law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11. which prohibits men to consult with the dead; of which restraint there had been no need nor use, if it had not been practised; and such practices had never been continued, if departed Souls had not frequented those places, and given answers to their Questions. But what I said before of Satans Impostures, is enough for present, to return to this also.</p>
                  <p n="3">

                        <hi>Bell.</hi> lib. 2. de Purg. cap. 6.</note>3. The <hi>Papists</hi> send them immediately to <hi>Purgatory</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their more thorough Purification. This <hi>Purgatory, Bellarmin</hi> thus describes: It is a certain place wherein, as in a Prison, Souls are purged after this life, that were not fully purged here, to the intent they may enter pure into Heaven; and though the Church (saith he) hath not defined the place, yet the <hi>School-men</hi> say, it is in the Bowels of the Earth, and upon the borders of Hell. And to countenance this profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Fable, divers Scriptures are by them abused and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.25, 26. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. all which have been fully rescued out of their hands, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly vindicated by our Divines, who have proved, God never kindled that fire to purifie Souls, but the <hi>Pope</hi> to warm his own <hi>Kitchin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another sort there are, who affirm, they neither wander about this World, nor go into <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but are cast by death into a Swoon or sleep; remaining in a kind of benummed condition, till the Resurrection of the Body. This was the Errour of <hi>Beryllus</hi>; and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> seems to border too near upon it, when he saith:

                  <p>All these mistakes will fall together by one stroak; for if it evidently appear (as I hope it will) that the Spirits of the just are immediately taken to God, and do converse with and enjoy him in Heaven: Then all these Fancies vanish, without any more labour about them particularly. Now there are four Considerations which to me put the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate glorification of the departed Souls of Believers, beyond all rational doubt.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>(1) Heaven is as ready and fit to receive them as ever it shall be.</item>
                     <item>(2) They are as ready and fit for Heaven, as ever they shall be.</item>
                     <item>(3) The Scripture is plainly for it. And</item>
                     <item>(4) There is nothing in reason against it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">(1) Heaven is as ready and fit to receive them when they die, as ever it shall be. Heaven is prepared for Believers, (1) By the purpose and Decree of God, and so far it was prepar'd from the Foundation of the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. (2) By the death of Christ, whose blood made the purchace of it for Believers, and so meritoriously opened the Gates thereof, which our sins had barred up against us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. (3) By the Ascension of Christ into that holy place, as our Representative and Forerunner, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.2. This is all that is necessary to be done for the preparation of Heaven; and all this is done, as much as ever God design'd should be done to it, in order to its preparation for our Souls. So that no delay can be upon that account.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:63760:124"/>(2) The departed Souls of Believers are as ready for Heaven as ever they shall be. For there is no preparation-work to be done by them, or upon them after death, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.10. Their justification was compleat before death, and now their sanctification is so too; Sin, which came in by the Union, going out at the separation of their Souls and Bodies. They are <hi>Spirits made perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3) The Scripture is plain and full for their immediate glorification, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43 <hi>To day shalt thou be with me in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi>: Luke 16.22. <hi>The Beggar dyed, and was carried by the Angels into Abraham</hi>'s <hi>bosome</hi>: Philip. 1.21. <hi>I desire to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and to be with Christ, which is far better.</hi> The Scripture speaks but of two ways, by which Souls see and enjoy God, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, and Sight; the one imperfect, suited to this life; the other perfect, fitted for the life to come; and this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately succeeding that, for the imperfect is done away by the coming of that which is perfect, as the Twilight is done away by the advancing of the perfect day.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) To conclude, There is nothing in reason lying in bar to it. It hath been proved before, the Soul in its unbodied State, is capable to enjoy blessedness, and can perform its acts of Intellection, Volition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only as well, but much better than it did when embodied. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That seeing Heaven is already as much prepar'd for Believers, as it need be, or can be; and they as much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd from the time of their Dissolution, as ever they shall be; The Scriptures also being so plain for it, and no bar in reason against it: All the forementioned Opinions are but the Dreams and Fancies of men, who have forsaken their Scripture-guide; and this remains an unshaken truth, That the Spirits of the just go immediately to glory, from the time of their Separation.</p>

                  <p>The time, yea, the set time is now come, to put an end to all the dolorous groans of gracious Souls upon the account of indwelling sin.

                  <p>There is a threefold burdensom evil in sin, under which all regenerated souls groan in this life, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) The Guilt, (2) The Filth, (3) The Inherence of it in their nature. And there is a threefold Remedy or cure of these evils. The guilt of sin is remedied by <hi>justification:</hi> The filth of sin is inchoatively healed by <hi>sanctification</hi>: The inherence of sin is totally eradicated by <hi>glorification.</hi> For as it entred into our persons, by the union of our Souls and Bodies; so it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cast out by their disunion or separation at death. The last stroak is then given to the work of sanctification, and the last is evermore the perfecting stroak: Sin lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished under imperfect sanctification in the time of life, but it gives up the Ghost under perfected sanctification, from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> after death. Sanctification gave it its deadly wound, but
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:63760:125"/>
glorification its final Abolition. For it is with our sins after Regeneration, as it was with that Beast mentioned <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.12. which though it was <hi>wounded with a deadly wound, yet its life was prolonged for a season</hi>: And this is the appointed season for its expiration. For if at their dissolution they are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately received into glory (as it hath been proved they are, in our seventh Proposition) they must necessarily be freed perfectly from sin, immediately upon their dissolution; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing that is unclean, can enter into that pure and holy place: They must be, as the Text truly represents them, <hi>The Spirits of just men made perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if so great holiness and purity be required in all that draw nigh to God upon earth, as you read <hi>Psal.</hi> 93.5. cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly those who are admitted immediately to his Throne, must be without fault, according to <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>When a compounded being comes to be dissolved, each part returns to its own principle; so it is here. The Spirit of man, and all the grace that is in it, came from God, and to him they return at death, and are perfected in him, and by him: The flesh returns to the earth whence it came, and all that body of sin is destroyed with it; neither the one or other shall be a snare or clog to the soul any more. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in this World, is but Gold in the Ore; at death the pure Gold is melted out and separated, and the dross cast away and consumed.</p>

When a good man had but a little more than ordinary of the joy of the Lord poured into his Soul, he was heard to cry, Hold, Lord, hold, thy poor Creature is but a clay Vessel, and can hold no more. These Pleasures the Soul hath in the Body, are of the same kind indeed with those in Heaven, but are exceeding short of them in divers other respects.</p>

the visions of Faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. But it comes far short of the facial vision. Who can tell the full importance of that one Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.4. <hi>The Throne of the Lamb shall be in it, and they shall see his face.</hi> O for such a Heaven (said one) as but to look through the key-hole, and get one glimpse of that lovely face! Earth cannot bear such sights. This light overwhelms and confounds the inadequate faculties of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and embodied Souls. But there it is <hi>lumen confortans,</hi> a chearing, strengthening pleasant light, as the light of <hi>the Morning star,</hi> Rev. 2.28.</item>
                              <item>4. This sight of God will be appropriative, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. We there see him as our own God and portion. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a clear interest in him, the sight of him could never be beatifical and satisfying. Sight without interest is like the light of a gloworm, light without heat. All doubts and objections are solv'd, and answer'd, in the first sight of this blessed face.</item>
                              <item>5. To conclude: This perfect and most comfortable knowledge is attained without labour by the separate Soul. Here every degree of knowledge was with the price of much pains. How many weary hours and aking heads did the acquisition of a little knowledg stand us in? But then it flows in upon the Soul easily. It was the Saying of a great <hi>Vsurer,</hi> I once took much pains to get a little (meaning the first stock) but now I get much without any pains at all. O lovely state of separation!

                  <head>PROP. XI. The separated Souls of the Iust do live in a more high and excellent way of Communion with God in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-worship in Heaven, than ever they did in the sweetest Gospel-Ordinances, and most Spiritual Duties, in which they conversed with him here on Earth.</head>
                  <p>THAT Saints on earth have real Communion with God, and that this Communion is the joy of their hearts, the life of their life, and their relief under all pressures and troubles in this life; is a truth so firmly sealed upon their hearts by experience, as well as clearly revealed in the Word, that there can remain no doubt about it among those that have any saving acquaintance with the life and power of Religion,</p>
                  <p>This Communion with God is of that precious value with Believers, that it unspeakably endears all those Duties and Ordinances to them, which as means and instruments are useful to maintain it.</p>
                  <p>At death, the people of God part with all those precious Ordinances and Duties, they being only designed for, and fitted to the present state of imperfection, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12, 13. but not at all to their loss, no more than it is to his, that loses the light of his candle, by the rising of the Sun. A Candle, a Star, is comfortable in the Night, but useless, when the Sun is up, and in it's meridian Glory. Christian, Pray much, hear much, and drive as profitable a trade as thou canst among the Ordinances of God, and duties of Religion: For the time is at hand that you shall serve and wait on God no more this way.</p>
                  <p>But yet think not your Souls shall be discharged from all Worship and Service of God when you dye: No, you will find Heaven to be <hi>a Temple</hi> built for worship, and the worship there to be much transcendent to all that in which
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63760:131"/>
you were here employ'd. The <hi>Sanctuary</hi> was a pattern of Heaven in this very respect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.23. And on this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is called <hi>Sion</hi> in my Text, and the <hi>heavenly Ierusalem</hi>; as denoting a Church-state, and the spiritual Worship there performed by the Spirits of just men made perfect.</p>
                  <p>Some help we may have to understand the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by comparing it with that Worship and Service which we perform to God here in this state of imperfection, and by considering the agreements and disagreements betwixt them. In this they agree, that the worship above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low are both addressed and directed to one and the same <hi>Object; Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi>; all centers and terminates in God. They also agree in the general quality, and common Nature; they are both spiritual Worship. But there are divers remarkable differences betwixt the one, and other, as will be manifest in the following collation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All our Worship on Earth is performed and transacted by <hi>Faith,</hi> as the instrument and mean thereof, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that cometh to God must believe,</hi> &amp;c. In Heaven Faith cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and sight takes place of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. There we see, what here we only believe. There are now before us, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Scriptures, Ministers, and the Assemblies of Saints in the places of worship: but if we have any communion with God, by or among these, we must set our selves to believe those things we see not. By realizing and applying invisible things, we here get sometimes, and with no small pains, a taste of Heaven, and a transient glance of that glory. In this service our Faith is put hard to it, it must work and fight at once. Resolutely act, whilst sense and reason stand by contradicting and quarrelling with it. And if with much ado, we get but one sensible touch of Heaven upon our Spirits, if we get a little spiritual warmth and melting of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards God, we call that day a good day, and it is so indeed.</p>
                  <p>But in Heaven all things are carried at an higher rate, the joy of the Lord overflows us without any labour or pains of ours to procure it. We may say of it there as the <hi>Prophet</hi> speaks of the dew and showres upon the grass, <hi>Which tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the Sons of men, Mic.</hi> 5.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:63760:131"/>2. No grace is or can be acted here, without the clog of a contrary corruption upon its heel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. <hi>When I would do good, evil is present with me.</hi> Every beam of faith is presently darkned by a cloud of unbelief, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief.</hi>

There is iniquity in our most holy things, which needs pardon, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. Our best duties have enough in them to damn us, as well as our worst sins, but in that perfect state above, grace flows purely out of the Soul, as beams do from the Sun, or crystal streams from the purest Fountain. No impure, or imperfect acts proceed from Spirits made perfect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here the graces of the Saints are never, or very rarely acted in their highest and most intense degree. When they love God most fervently, there is some coldness in their love. Who comes up to the height of that rule, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.37. <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy mind, and all thy strength.</hi> When we meditate on God, it is not in the depth of our thoughts, without some wanderings and extravagancies, 'tis very hard, if not impossible for the Soul to stand long in its full bent to God.</p>
                  <p>But in Heaven it doth so, and will do so for ever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any relaxation or remission of its fervour. Christ among the Saints and Angels in Heaven, is as a mighty Load-stone cast in amongst many Needles, which leap to him, and fix themselves inseparably upon him. They all act in glory as the fire doth here, to the utmost of their power and ability. There is no note lower, than Glory to God in the highest.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The most spiritual Souls on earth, who live most with God, have, and must have their dayly and frequent intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. The necessities of the Body, as well as the defectiveness of their graces require and necessitate it to be so. Our hands with <hi>Moses</hi> will hang down, and grow weary. Our affections will cool and fall, do what we can.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:63760:132"/>But as the Spirits of just men made perfect know no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions in the degree, so neither any intermissions in the actings of their grace: <hi>They shall serve him day and night in his Temple,</hi> Rev. 7.15. You that would purchase the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of your spiritual comforts but for a day, with all that you have in this World, will there enjoy them at full, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intermitting throughout eternity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If the best hearts on earth be at any time more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily enlarged in spiritual comforts, they need presently some humbling providence to hide pride from their eyes. Even <hi>Paul</hi> himself must have a thorn in the flesh, a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Satan to buffet him. <hi>Bernard</hi> could never perform any duty with comfortable enlargement, but he seemed to hear his own heart whisper thus, <hi>benè fecisti, Bernarde,</hi> O well done, <hi>Bernard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in Heaven, the highest comforts are injoyed in the deepest humility, and the intire glory is ascribed to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any unworthy defalcations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.10. They put not the Crown upon their own heads, but Christs: they cast down their Crowns, and fall down at the feet of him that sitteth upon the Throne.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All Assemblies for worship in this World are mixed: They consist of Regenerate, and Unregenerate, living and dead Souls; this spoils the harmony, and allays the comfort of mutual Communion. In a Congregation consisting of a 1000 persons, Ah! How few comparatively are there that are heartily concerned in the Duty! But it is not so above. There are ten thousand times ten thousand, even thousands of thousands before the Throne, loving, adoring, praising, and triumphing together, and not a jaring string in all their Harps.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Here the worship of God is impured, mixed, and adulterated by the sinful additions and inventions of men. This gracious Souls groan under as an heavy burden, sighing and praying for Reformation; as knowing they can expect no more of Gods presence, than there is of his Order and Institution in Worship. But above, all the Worship is pure,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63760:132"/>
the least pin in the heavenly <hi>Tabernacle</hi> is according to the perfect pattern of the divine Will.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We have here Duties of divers kinds and natures to perform. All our time is not to be spent in loving, praising, and delighting in God: but we must turn our selves also to searching, watching, and Soul-humbling work. Sometimes we are called to get up our hearts to the highest praise, and then to humble them to the dust for sin and judgments. One while to sing his praises, and another while to sigh even to the breaking of our loins: but the Spirits of just men made perfect, have but one kind of imployment, <hi>viz</hi> praising, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and delighting in God. There is no groaning, sighing, searching, or watching-work in that state.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The most illuminated Believers on Earth have but dark and crude apprehensions of Christs intercession work in Heaven, or of the way and manner in which it is there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him. We know indeed, that our High-Priest is for us entred within the vail, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. That he appears in that most holy place for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. That he there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents his sufferings for us to God, standing before him as a Lamb that had been slain, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6. That he offers up our prayers with his incense to God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3.</p>
                  <p>But the immediate intuition of the whole performance by the person of Christ in Heaven, the beholding of him in his work there, with the smiles and honours, the delight and satisfaction of the Father in his Person and Work: certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this must be a far different thing, and what must make more deep and suitable impressions upon our hearts, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the most affecting view of them by Faith at this distance, could do.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>In such ravishing sights, and joyful ascriptions of glory to him that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:63760:133"/>The illustration and confirmation of this assertion we have in these two or three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1). That all the Spirits of just men from the beginning of the World, until Christs ascension into Heaven, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Heaven as a place of rest, as a City prepared for them of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. and did enjoy blessedness and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there: but yet there seems to be an alteration even in Heaven it self, since the Ascension of Christ into it, and such an alteration as advanceth the glory thereof both to Angels and Saints.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s <hi>Coristologia,</hi> p. 158.</note>
                     <q>Heaven it self (saith one who is now there) was not what it is, before the entrance of Christ into the Sanctuary for the administration of his Office. Neither the Saints departed, nor the Angels themselves were participant of that glory which now they are. Neither yet doth this argue any defect in Heaven, or the state thereof in its primitive constitution: For the perfection of any state hath respect unto that order of things which it is originally suited unto.

                     <hi>God having ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect,</hi> Heb. 11.40.</p>
                  <p>Now both the Angels and Saints in Heaven do behold Christ in his Priestly Office within that Sanctuary, a sight never seen in Heaven before.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) This frame of heavenly Worship will continue as it is, until the end of the World, and then another alteration will be made in the manner of his dispensatory King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 28. so that as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of Heaven is not in all respects, what it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ's Ascension thither; so after the Consummation of the Mediatorial Kingdom, and the gathering all the Elect into Glory, it will not in all respects be what now it is.</p>
                  <p>Christ will never cease to be the immediate head of the whole glorified Creation. God having gathered all the Elect, both Angels and Men, unto an head in him, and he being the Knot or Centre of that Collective Body; the whole frame of the glorified Church would be dissolved, should he lose his relation of an head to it. Yea, I doubt not but he will for ever continue to be the <hi>medium</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication betwixt God and his glorified Church: God will still Communicate himself to us through Christ, and our adherence, love and delight, will still be through Christ: In a word, whatever change shall be made, the Person of Christ, and therein his humane nature, shall still continue to be the eternal Object of Divine Glory, Praise, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.4.</p>

Hence it is that there is joy in Heaven upon the Conversion of any poor sinner on Earth, because thereby the Body of Christ my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical advanceth towards its fulness and compleatness, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10. no sooner is a poor Soul struck by the word to the heart, and sent home crying, O sick! Sick!

<q>I have with good assurance, this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Minister, who being alone in a Journey, and willing to make the best improvement he could of that days Solitude; set himself to a close Examination of the state of his Soul; and then of the life to come, and the manner of its being and living in Heaven, in the views of all those things which are now pure Objects of Faith, and Hope. After a while, he perceived his thoughts begin to fix, and come closer to these great and astonishing things, than was usual; and as his mind setled upon them, his affections began to rise with answerable liveliness and vigour.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>He therefore (whilst he was yet Master of his own thoughts) lifted up his heart to God in a short Ejaculation, that God would so order it in his Providence, that he might meet with no interruption from Company, or any other Accident in that Journey, which was granted him: for in all that days journey, he neither met, overtook, or was overtaken by any. Thus going on his way, his thoughts
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63760:136"/>
began to swell and rise higher and higher, like the waters in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vision, till at last, they became an overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flood. Such was the intention of his mind, such the ravishing tastes of heavenly Joys, and such the full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his interest therein; that he utterly lost the sight and sense of this World, and all the concerns thereof, and for some hours knew no more where he was, than if he had been in a deep sleep upon his Bed. At last, he began to perceive himself very faint, and almost choaked with blood, which running in abundance from his Nose, had discoloured his Cloaths, and his Horse, from the Shoulder to the Hoof. He found himself almost spent, and nature to faint under the pressure of joy unspeakable, and unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable; and at last perceiving a Spring of water in his way, he with some difficulty, alighted to cleanse and cool his face and hands, which were drenched in Blood, Tears, and Sweat.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>By that Spring he sate down, and washed; earnestly desiring if it were the pleasure of God, that might be his parting place from this World: He said, Death had the most aimable face in his eye, that ever he beheld, except the face of Jesus Christ, which made it so; and that he could not remember (though he believed he should die there) that he had one thought of his dear Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <q>But having drank of that Spring, his Spirits revived, the Blood stenched, and he mounted his Horse again, and on he went in the same frame of Spirit, till he had finished a Journey of near thirty Miles, and came at Night to his Inn. Where being come, he greatly admired how he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that his Horse, without his direction, had brought him thither, and that he fell not all that day, which past not without several Trances of considerable continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Being alighted, the Inn-keeper came to him, with some astonishment, (being acquainted with him formerly) O Sir, said he, what is the matter with you? You look like a dead man. Friend, replied he, I was never better in my life. Shew me my Chamber, cause my Cloak to be cleansed, burn me a little Wine, and that is all I desire of

you for present. Accordingly it was done, and a Supper sent up, which he could not touch, but requested of the people, they would not trouble or disturb him for that Night. All this Night passed without one wink of sleep, though he never had a sweeter Nights rest in all his life. Still, still, the joy of the Lord overflowed him, and he seemed to be an Inhabitant of the other World. The next Morning being come, he was early on Horse-back again, fearing the Divertisements in the Inn might bereave him of his joy, for he said it was now with him, as with a man that carries a rich treasure about him, who suspects every <hi>Passenger</hi> to be a <hi>Thief</hi>; but within a few hours he was sensible of the ebbing of the Tyde, and before Night, though there was an heavenly serenity and sweet peace upon his Spirit, which continued long with him, yet the Transports of joy were over, and the fine edge of his delight blunted. He many years after called that day, one of the days of Heaven, and professed he understood more of the life of Heaven by it, than by all the Books he ever read, or Discourses he ever entertained about it.</q>

                     <p>As for the habits of grace which accompany it to Heaven, it would much facilitate our apprehension of it, if we but compare acquired and infused habits with each other. 'Tis true, they are of different Natures and Originals, but the Soul is the subject of them both, and their inhesion and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement is much after the same manner.</p>
                     <p>Take we then an acquired habit into consideration, which is nothing else, but <hi>a permanent Quality rendering the subject of it prompt and ready to perform a work with ease</hi>: Suppose that of <hi>Musick,</hi> or <hi>Writing,</hi> and we shall find these habits to be safely lodged in the Soul, as well when the body is laid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63760:139"/>
the deepest sleep, which is the Image of death, as when it is awake and most active; for they are both <hi>Artists</hi> when asleep, and need learn no new Rules to play, or write when you awake them: which shews the habits to be permanent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted in their minds.</p>
                     <p>Infused habits of grace are as deeply rooted in the Soul, yea, deeper than any acquired habit can be: For when Knowledge and Tongues shall be done away, love abideth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. <hi>viz.</hi> after death, when the Body is asleep in the Grave.</p>

                     <p>Add hereto, that these habits of grace are inseparably rooted or lodged in a subject which is by nature a <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is to say,<note place="margin">The Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and Will are the primary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called Inorganical; because not affixed to any Member of the Body as the sensitive Appetite and loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motive Powers are to their proper Organs. The Soul therefore hath the free use and exercise of them in its separate state.</note> an intelligent active Being, able to use its faculties of Understanding, Will, and Affections, and consequently in their use to reduce these habits of Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in them into act; without the help of the Body: For to suppose otherwise, were to dispirit it, and destroy the very nature of it.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, let this Spirit thus furnished with gracious habits, be now considered in separation from the Body, in which state it enjoyeth and rejoyceth in a double Priviledge it never had before, <hi>viz. Perfection</hi> both of it self, and of its Graces, and the nearest access to God it is capable of, 2 Cor. 5.6. <hi>Absent from the Body, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with the Lord.</hi> It hath now no body to clog or cloud it, nor can it complain of distance from God, as it did in this World. O at what rate must we conceive the love and delight of a Soul under these great advantages to cast out their very Spirits, as I may say, in their glorious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:63760:140"/>
and Exercises. Well then, here you find
<q>A <hi>Spirit</hi> naturally endued with Understanding, Will, and Affections: in these Faculties and Affections the habits of Grace permanently rooted, which therefore accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it in its ascension to glory: an ability to use and exercise these Faculties and Graces, and that in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent degree and manner than it did, or could in this World, the subject and habits inherent, being now both made perfect: The clog of flesh knockt off, and all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from God removed, by its coming home to him, even as near as the capacity of the Soul can admit. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such a Spirit so qualified, now rankt in its proper order among innumerable other holy and blessed Spirits which surround the Throne of God, beholding his face with infinite delectation, and acting all its Powers and Graces to the highest in the worshipping, praising, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and admiring him that sitteth on the Throne, and the Lamb for evermore.</q>
And then you have a true, though imperfect Idea or Notion of the Spirit of a just man made perfect.</p>
                     <p>I will not here make use of the other Glass, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent a damned Soul, separate for a time from its Body, and for ever from the Lord; that will be shewn you in its proper place.</p>

                     <p>For the clear stating and satisfying of this Question, I will lay down some things <hi>negatively,</hi> and some things <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> about it. On the <hi>negative</hi> part I desire two things may be noted.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:63760:140"/>1. First, That there is no difference betwixt the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one gracious Soul, and another <hi>in point of safety.</hi> Every regenerate Soul is fully secured in and by Jesus Christ from the danger of perishing, and is out of hazzard of the Wrath to come.</p>
                     <p>This must needs be so, because all that are in Christ are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually justified by the imputation of Christ's Righteousness, without difference to them all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Even the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God which is by Faith of Iesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe, for there is no difference:</hi> By vertue whereof, they are all equally secured from Wrath to come, one as well as another: as all that sailed with <hi>Paul,</hi> so all that die in Christ come safe to the shoar of Glory, and not one of them is lost. The sting of Death smites none that are in Christ.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, There is no difference betwixt the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls of just men, in respect of the supporting presence of God with them in that their hour of distress; that Promise belongs to them all, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.15. <hi>I will be with him in trouble,</hi> and so doth that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>I will never leave thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake thee.</hi> Their God is certainly with them all, to order the Circumstances of their death, and all the Occurrences of that day, to his glory, and their good. <hi>Supports</hi> I have (said a good man in such an hour) though <hi>Suavities</hi> I want; and so they have also who meet with the hardest tug at death.</p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding their equality in these Priviledges, there is a great difference betwixt the departing Souls of just men. And this difference is manifest both in the

                           <item>II. Internal Circumstances of their death.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. In the External Circumstances of their death, all have not one and the same passage to Heaven in all respects; for
<list>
                           <item>(1) First some go thither by the ordinary road of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death from their Beds, and the arms of lamenting friends, to the arms and bosome of Jesus Christ: But others swim through the Red Sea to <hi>Canaan,</hi> from a <hi>Scaffold</hi> to the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:63760:141"/>
                              <hi>Throne,</hi> from a Gibbet or Stake to their Fathers house, from insulting Enemies to their triumphant Brethren, the Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing Multitude. This is a rough, but honourable way to Glory.</item>
                           <item>(2) Some lie long under the hand of death, before it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch them, it approaches them by slow and lingering paces, they feel every step of death distinctly as it comes on towards them: But others are favoured with a quick dispatch, a short passage from hence to Glory. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> feared a pineing sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Isa.</hi> 38.10, 12. what he feared, many feel. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Days, yea Weeks and Months, have many gracious Souls dwelt upon the brink of the Pit, crying, How long Lord, how long!</item>
                           <item>(3) The pains and throes of death are more acute and sharp to some of Gods people, than to others: Death is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the most mild and gentle form of it. Two such dear and intimate Friends as the Soul and Body are, cannot part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some tears, groans, or sighs; and those more deep and emphatical than the groans and sighs of the living use to be: But yet (comparatively speaking) the death of one may be stiled sweet and easie to anothers. <hi>Latimer</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> found it so, though burnt in the same flame.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this respect all things come alike to all, and the same difference is found in the worst, as well as in the best men: Some like <hi>Sheep</hi> are laid in the Grave, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.14. others die in the bitterness of their Soul, <hi>Iob</hi> 21.25. and by this no man knows either love or hatred.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. There are beside these, some remarkable. Internal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the dissolution of good men; the sum whereof is in this,
<list>
                           <item>1. That some gracious Souls have a very hard, strait, difficult entrance into Heaven: just as it is with Ships that sail by a very bare wind, all their art, care, and pains, will but just weather some head-land or Cape: they steer fast by some dangerous Rock or Sand, and with a thousand fears and dangers, win their <hi>Port</hi> at last. Saved they are, but yet
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:63760:141"/>
(to use the Apostles phrase) scarcely saved, or saved as by fire. And this difficulty ariseth to them from one or all these causes:
<list>
                                 <item>(1) It ordinarily ariseth from the weakness of their faith, which is in many Souls without either the light of evidence, or strength of reliance: neither able to dissolve their doubts, nor steadily repose their hearts, and thus they die, much at the rate they lived, poor doubting and cloudy, though gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls. They can neither speak much of the comfort of past experiences, nor of the present foretasts of Heaven.</item>
                                 <item>
                                    <p n="2">(2) The violent assaults and batteries of temptations make the passage exceeding difficult to some. O the sharp conflicts and dreadful combates many poor Souls endure upon a death-bed! O the charges of hypocrisie fortified by neglects of duty, formality, and bye-ends in duty, falls into sin after conviction and humiliation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which the Soul is apt to yield to, and admit the dreadful conclusion.</p>
                                    <p>These are the last, and therefore oft-times the most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conflicts. The malice, of Satan will send them halting to Heaven, if he cannot bar them out of it.</p>
                                 </item>
                                 <item>(3) To conclude. The hidings of Gods face, puts terror into the face of death, and makes a dying day a dark and gloomy day. All darkness disposes to fear, but none like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward darkness. They must, like a Ship in distress, venture into the <hi>Harbour</hi> in the dark, though they see not their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</item>

Even an abundant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the everlasting Kingdom. What a difference doth God make, not only betwixt those that have grace, and those that have none; but betwixt gracious Souls them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this matter! The things which usually make an easy passage to Heaven are
<list>
                                 <item>(1) A pardon cleared, <hi>Isai.</hi> 33.24. The Sense of pardon swallows up the sense of pain.</item>
                                 <item>
                                    <pb n="250" facs="tcp:63760:142"/>(2) An heart weaned from this world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9, 13, 16. An heart loosed from the World, is a foot out of the snare. Mortified limbs are cut off from the Body with little pain.</item>
                                 <item>(3) Fervent love to Christ, and longings to be with him, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.23. He that loves Christ fervently, must needs loath absence from Christ proportionably.</item>
                                 <item>(4) Purity and peace of Conscience make a death-bed soft and easie. The strains and wounds of Conscience in the time of life, are so many Thorns in our Bed or pillow in the time of Death, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.21. But integrity gives bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</item>
                                 <item>(5) The work of obedience faithfully finished, or a sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy course of holiness throughout our life, is that which usually yields much peace and joy in death, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24.</item>
                                 <item>(6) But above all, the presence of the Comforter with us in that cloudy and dark day, turns it into one of the days of Heaven, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. And thus you see, though all dying Christians be equally safe, and all supported and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through by the power of God; yet their farewels to the Body are not alike chearful. There are many external, and internal circumstantial differences in the deaths of good men, as well as a substantial and essential difference betwixt all their deaths, and the death of a wicked man.</item>

                     <hi>the following grounds are laid.</hi>

                     <head>REASON I.</head>
                     <p>The sufficient ordinary provision God hath made in this case, renders all such extraordinary notices and intimations of our Death needless: And be sure the most wise God doth nothing in vain. We have three standing, ordinary, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means to premonish us of our departure hence, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scriptures, Reason, and daily Examples of Mortality before our eyes. The Scriptures tell us our life is but <hi>a vapour, which appeareth for a little while, and then vanisheth away,</hi> James 4.14. <hi>That our days are but to an hand breadth, and that every man in his best estate is vanity,</hi> Psal. 39.5.</p>
                     <p>Reason tells us, so feeble a tye as our breath is, can never secure our lives long. The living know that they must dye,

                        <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.5. The radical moisture which is daily consuming by the flame of life, must needs be spent ere long.</p>
                     <p>And all the Graves we see opened so frequently are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient warnings, that we our selves must shortly follow. Therefore as there was no need of <hi>Manna,</hi> when bread might be had in an ordinary way; so neither is there need of extraordinary signs, when God hath abundantly furnished us with standing and ordinary means for this purpose.</p>

                     <p>And as the Scriptures render such signs needless, so they seem to be directly against them. Christ commands us to watch, because <hi>we know not in what hour the Lord cometh.</hi> Yea, even <hi>Isaac</hi> himself, an extraordinary person, and endued with a Spirit of Prophecy, whereby he foretold the condition of his Sons after him, yet it's said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.2. That he knew not the day of his death. And it is not reasonable to think that common persons should know that, which extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and prophetick persons knew not.</p>

                     <p>All mankind belong either to God, or the Devil. To such as belong to God, such extraordinary warnings are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, for they have a watchful principle within them which continually prompts them to mind their change; and besides, death cannot endanger those that are in Christ, how suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or unexpectedly soever it should befal them.</p>
                     <p>And for wicked men, it cannot be thought God should favour and priviledg them in this matter above his own children; and as for <hi>Satan,</hi> he knows not the time of their death himself: and if he did, it would thwart his design and interest to discover it to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21.

Thus the death of <hi>Abijah</hi> was foretold to his Mother by the Prophet, and the precise hour thereof, which fell out answerably, 1 <hi>King</hi> 14.6, 12. And thus the death of the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told exactly both as to kind, and place, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 37.7, 37, 38.</item>

                     <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> predicted the very place and manner of the death of the <hi>Laird of Grange.</hi>

                           <hi>Clark</hi>'s Lives. p. 277.</note> You have sometime seen the courage and constancy of the <hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Grange</hi> in the cause of God, and now that unhappy man is casting himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. I pray you go to him from me (said <hi>Mr. Knox</hi>) and tell him that unless he forsake that wicked course he is in, the Rock wherein he confideth, shall not defend him, nor the carnal wisdom of that man (meaning the young <hi>Leshing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>), whom he counteth half a God, shall help him: but he shall be shamefully pull'd out of that nest, and his carcase hung before the Sun. And even so it fell out the following year, when the <hi>Castle</hi> was taken, and his Body hang'd out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sun. Thus God exactly fulfilled the prediction of his death.</p>
                     <p>The same Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> in the year 1566. being in the Pulpit at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> upon the Lords day, a paper was given up to him among many others, wherein these words were scoffing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written concerning the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> who was slain the day before, <hi>Take up the man, whom ye accounted another God.</hi> At the end of the Sermon, Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> bewailed the loss that the Church and state had by the death of that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man, and then added, There is one in this company that makes this horrible murther, the subject of his mirth,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63760:144"/>
for which all good men should be sorry; but I tell him he shall dye where there shall be none to lament him. The man that wrote the Paper, was one <hi>Thomas Metellan,</hi> a young <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who shortly after in his Travels, died in <hi>Italy,</hi> having none to assist, or lament him.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. And others have had premonitions and signs of their own deaths, which accordingly fell out. And these premoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been given them, sometimes by strong irresistible impressions upon their minds, sometimes in dreams, and sometimes by unusual elevations of their Spirits in duties of Communion with God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some have had strong and irresistible impressions of their approaching change made upon their minds. So had Sir <hi>Anthony Wingfield</hi> who was slain at <hi>Brest, Anno</hi> 1594. At his undertaking of that expedition,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohn Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, p. 46.</note> he was strongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded it would be his death; and therefore so setled and disposed of his Estate, as one that never reckoned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again. And the day before he died, he took order for the payment of his debts, as one that strongly presaged the time was now at hand, which accordingly fell out the next day.</p>
                     <p>Much of the same nature was that of the late <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Marleburrough,</hi> who fell in the <hi>Holland</hi> War. He not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saged his own fall in that Encounter, (which was exactly answered in the event) but left behind him that memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent Letter, which evidenced to all the World, what deep fixed apprehensions of Eternity it had left upon his Spirit. Many examples of this nature might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, of such as have in their perfect health foretold their own death; and others who have dropt such passages as were afterwards better understood by their sorrowful friends, than when they first dropt from their lips.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Others have been premonished of their death by <hi>Dreams,</hi> sometimes their own, and sometimes others. The learned and judicious <hi>Amyraldus</hi> gives us this well attested relation of <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

About four of the clock the day before he died, a <hi>Matron,</hi> who died a little before, and whilst living was dear to Mr. <hi>Vsher,</hi> appeared to him in his sleep, and invited him to sup with her the next night: he at first denyed her, but she more vehemently pressing her request on him, at last he consented, and that very night he died.</p>
                     <p>I have also the fullest assurance that can be, of the truth
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63760:145"/>
of this following Narrative. A person yet living was greatly concerned about the welfare of his dear Father and Mother who were both shut up in <hi>London</hi> in the time of the great Contagion in 1665. Many Lettets he sent to them, and many hearty prayers to Heaven for them. But about a fortnight before they were infected, he fell about break of day into this dream, That he was in a great <hi>Inn</hi> which was full of company, and being very desirous to find a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate room, where he might feek God for his parents life, he went from room to room, but found company in them all; at last casting his eye into a little chamber which was empty, he went into it, lockt the door, kneeled down by the outside of the bed, fixing his eyes upon the plaisterd wall within side the bed; and whilst he was vehemently begging of God the life of his Friends, there appeared upon the plaister of the wall before him the Sun and the Moon, shining in their full strength. The sight at first amaz'd and discomposed him so far, that he could not continue his Prayer, but kept his eye fixed upon the body of the Sun; at last a small line or ring of black no bigger than that of a Text pen circled the Sun, which increasing sensibly, eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in a little time the whole Body of it, and turned it into a blackish colour; which done, the figure of the Sun was immediately changed into a perfect Death's head, and after a little while vanished quite away. The <hi>Moon</hi> still continued shining as before, but whilst he intently beheld it, it also darkned in like manner, and turned also into another Death's head, and vanished. This made so great an impression upon the beholder's mind, that he immediately awaked in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and perplexity of thoughts about his dream; and awakning his wife, related the particulars to her with much emotion and concernment; but how to apply it he could not presently tell, only he was satisfied that the dream was of an extraordinary nature. At last <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s dream came to his thoughts with the like <hi>Emblems,</hi> and their interpretation, which fully satisfied him that God had warned and prepared him thereby for a suddain parting with his dear Relations, which answerably fell out in the same order, his Father dying that day fortnight following, and his Mother just a month afterwards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:63760:145"/>I know there is much vanity in dreams, and yet I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied some are weighty significant, and declarative of the purposes of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Lastly, An unusual and extraordinary elevation of the Soul to God, and enlargement in Communion with him, hath been a signifying forerunner of the death of some good men. For as the <hi>Body</hi> hath its <hi>levamen anteferale,</hi> lightning before death, and is more vegete and brisk a little before its dissolution; so it is sometimes with the <hi>Soul</hi> also. I have known some persons to arrive on a suddain, to such heights of love to God, and vehement longings to be dissolved, that they might be with Christ, that I could not but look upon it, as Christ did upon the box of Oyntment, as done against their death. And so indeed it hath proved in the event.</p>
                     <p>Thus it was with that renowned Saint, Mr. <hi>Brewen</hi> of <hi>Stapleford,</hi> as he excelled others in the holiness of his life, so he much excelled himself towards his death; his motions towards Heaven being then most vigorous and quick. The day before his last sickness, he had such extraordinary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements of heart in his Closet-Duty, that he seemed to forget all the concernments of his Body, and this lower World. And when his wife told him, Sir, I fear you have done your self hurt with rising so early; he answered:
<q>If you had seen such glorious things as I saw this morning in private prayer with God, you would not have said so: for they were so wonderful and unspeakable, that whether I was in the Body, or out of the Body, with <hi>Paul,</hi> I cannot tell.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And so it was with learned and holy Mr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> who seemed as a man in Heaven, just before he went thither. And so if hath been with thousands beside these. I confess it is not the lot of every gracious Soul, (as was shew'd you in the last Question) nor doth it make any difference as to the safety of the Soul, whatever it makes as to comfort. Let all therefore labour to make sure their Union with Christ, and live in the daily exercises of grace in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion; and then, though God should give them no such extraordinary warnings one way or another, they shall never be surprized by death to their loss, let it come never so unexpectedly upon them.</p>

Whatever therefore <hi>Satan</hi> doth in this matter, must be done either by conjecture, or commission. As to the case of <hi>Saul,</hi> 'tis not to be questioned but that he knowing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was made to <hi>David</hi> by promise, and that the Lord was departed from <hi>Saul,</hi> and saw how near the <hi>Armies</hi> were to a Battel, might strongly conjecture and conclude, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly tell him, <hi>To morrow thou shalt be with me,</hi> 1 Sam. 28.19.</p>
                     <p>And so for the death of <hi>Caesar,</hi> The Devil knew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was strong against him, and the Plot laid for that day; and so it was both easie for him to reveal it to the <hi>South-say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and his interest to do it: thereby to bring that cursed Art into reputation.</p>
                     <p>As for other signs and forewarnings of death, by the unusual resort of doleful Creatures, as <hi>Owls</hi> and <hi>Ravens,</hi> vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly accounted Ominous, <hi>Wall-watches,</hi> upon this account called <hi>Death-watches</hi>; and the eating of wearing-appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel by <hi>Rats</hi>: I look upon them generally as supertitious fancies, not worthy to be regarded among Christians. God may, but I know not what ground we have to believe that he doth, commissionate such Creatures to bring us the message of death from him. To conclude therefore,</p>
                     <p>Let no man expect or depend upon any such extraordinary premonitions and warnings of his change, or neglect his daily work and duty of preparation for it. We have warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Word, in the examples of Mortality frequently before us, in all the diseases and decays we often feel in our own Bodies: and by the signs of the times, which threaten death and desolation.

                  <head>QUEST. IV. Whether separated Souls have any knowledg of, or commerce and intercourse with men in this life: and if not, What is to be thought of the Apparitions of the Dead?</head>
                  <p n="1">1. By <hi>separated Souls,</hi> understand the departed Souls both of the Godly and Ungodly indifferently: and not as it is restrained to one sort only in the Text; for of both it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended there are frequent Apparitions after death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the knowledge such Souls are supposed to have after death both of persons and things in this lower World, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not a general knowledg, which one fort of them have of the state and condition of the Church militant on earth; for this we think cannot be denyed to the Spirits of the just made perfect, seeing they are still fellow Members with us of the same mystical body of Christ, and do behold our High-Priest appearing before God, and offering up our prayers for us; and long for the consummation of the Body of Christ as well as cry for vengeance against the persecutors thereof, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 10. Nor do I think those words, <hi>Isai.</hi> 63.16. repugnant hereunto, <hi>Abraham is ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledgeth us not.</hi> For I look upon the import of those words only as an humble acknowledgment of their defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which rendered them unworthy that their Forefathers should own or acknowledg them any more for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Iob. 14. 21.

                  <p>But I here understand such a particular knowledg of our personal states and conditions, as they once had when they dwelt amongst us in the Body, and this seems to be denied them by those Scriptures alledged against it in the margent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By commerce and intercourse, understand not their intercession with God for us, which the <hi>Papists</hi> affirm; but their concernments about our natural or civil interest in this World, so as to be useful to our <hi>persons,</hi> by warning us of death, or dangers; or to our <hi>Estates,</hi> by disquieting such as wrong us, in not fulfilling the Wills and Testaments they once made; or by giving us notice by words or signs of the death of our friends who died at a distance from us, or come to some violent and untimely end.</p>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:63760:149"/>
do at the time and place agreed upon, and have sometimes discourse with them.</p>
                     <p>Infinite examples of Murthers (saith <hi>Dr. More</hi>) have been discovered by Dreams, the Souls of the Persons mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered seeming to appear to some or other asleep, and to make their complaints to them; giving us a notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of <hi>Baronius,</hi> of <hi>Marsilius Ficinus,</hi> who having made a solemn vow with <hi>Michael Mercatus,</hi> (after they had been pretty warmly disputing of the immortality of the Soul out of the Principles of their Master <hi>Plato</hi>) that whether of them two die first, should appear to his Friend, and give him certain information of that truth. It was <hi>Ficinus</hi> his fate to diel first, and that not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this mutual resolution. He was mindful of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise when he had left the Body; for <hi>Mercatus</hi> being very intent at his studies, betimes on a morning, heard a Horse riding by with all speed, and observed that he stopt at his window; and therewith heard the voice of his Friend <hi>Ficinus,</hi> crying out aloud, <hi>O Michael, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael, vera, vera sunt illa</hi>: That is O <hi>Michael, Michael,</hi> those things are true, they are true. Wherepou he sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly opened his window, and espying <hi>Marsilius</hi> upon a <hi>white Steed,</hi> called after him, but he vanished out of his sight. He sent therefore presently to <hi>Florence</hi> to know how <hi>Marsilius</hi> did, and understood that he died about that hour he called at his window.</p>
                     <p>Much to the same purpose is that so famous and well attested story of the apparition of Major <hi>George Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham</hi> to Captain <hi>William Dyke,</hi>

The summ is this, The <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Captain</hi> had many disputes about the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God, and the immortality of the Soul, in which points they could never be resolved, though they much sought for and desired it, and therefore it was at last fully agreed betwixt them, that he that died first, should the third night after his Funeral, come betwixt the hours of twelve and one, to the little house in the Garden adjoining to <hi>Major Sydenham</hi>'s house at <hi>Dulverton</hi> in <hi>Somerset-shire.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> died first,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63760:149"/>
and the Captain happened to lie that very night which was appointed, in the same Chamber and Bed with Dr. <hi>Dyke</hi>; he acquainted the <hi>Doctor</hi> with the appointment, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to attend the place and hour that Night, for which purpose he had got the key of that Garden. The <hi>Doctor</hi> could by no means divert his purpose, but when the hour came he was upon the place, where he waited two hours and an half, neither seeing, nor hearing any thing more than usual. About six Weeks after, the Captain and <hi>Doctor</hi> went to <hi>Eaton,</hi> and lay again in the same <hi>Inn,</hi> but not the same Camber as before at <hi>Dulverton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Morning before they went thence, the Captain stayed longer than was usual in his Chamber, and at length came in to the <hi>Doctors</hi> Chamber, but in a Visage and form much differing from himself; with his hair and eyes staring, and his whole body shaking and trembling: whereat the <hi>Doctor</hi> wondering, demanded, what is the matter, Cousin Captain? The Captain replies, I have seen my Major: at which the Doctor seeming to smile, the Captain said, if ever I saw him in my life, I saw him but now: adding as followeth. This Morning (said he) after it was light, some one came to my Bed side, and sudainly drawing back the Curtains, calls <hi>Cap, Cap,</hi> (which was the term of familiarity that the <hi>Major</hi> used to call the <hi>Captain</hi> by) to whom I replied, What, my <hi>Major?</hi> To which he returns, I could not come at the time appointed, but I am now come to tell you, <hi>That there is a God, and a very just and terrible one, and if you do not turn over a new leaf, you will find it so.</hi> This stuck close to him, little Meat would go down with him at Dinner, though an handsom Treat was provided; these words were sounding in his ears frequently, during the remainder of his life: he was never shy or scrupulous to relate it to any that asked him concerning it, nor ever mentioned it but with horrour, and trepidation: they were both men of a brisk humour and jolly Conversation; of very quick and keen parts, having been both <hi>Vniversity</hi> and <hi>Inns-of-Court</hi> Gentlemen.</p>
                     <p>The Apparition of the Ghost of Sir <hi>George Villiers,</hi> Father of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> giving three solemn warnings, by three several Apparitions to his Servant Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> is a known and credible Story. But I will wade no farther into

                     <p>In like manner we read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.52, 53. that at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of our Lord, <hi>many Bodies of the Saints arose, and appeared unto many:</hi> these were no <hi>Phantasms,</hi> but the very Souls of the departed Saints returned (having re-assumed their own Bodies) unto this World, not only to confirm the truth of Christs Resurrection, and adorn that great day: But as a <hi>Specimen</hi> or handsel of the Resurrection of all the Saints in the vertue of his Resurrection at the great Day.</p>
                     <p>Nor will I deny, but upon some lesser (though never without weighty and solemn) occasions and reasons, God may sometimes send the Souls of the dead back again into this World, as in the cases before recited, to evidence against the <hi>Atheism</hi> of men, <hi>&amp;c.

That the Souls of men know neither contrary, nor corruption? that they subsist beyond the body, and continue by the priviledge of their proper nature, and without a Miracle: that the Souls of the faithful, as they leave earth; take possession of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. That those Apparitions and Ghosts of departed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, are not the wandering Souls of <hi>men,</hi> but the unquiet Walks of <hi>Devils,</hi> prompting and suggesting us unto <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, blood</hi> and <hi>Villany.</hi>
                        </q>
And with this Opinion I concur, as to the ordinary and common Apparitions of the dead: and my Reasons are,</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) Because the Scriptures every where describe the state of departed Souls as a fixed state, either in Heaven, or in Hell: and assigns the good or evil done in this World by Spirits, not to the departed Spirits of men, but to Angels or Devils: and it is our duty to regulate our Conceits by Scripture, and not according to the vain Philosophy of the Heathens, or the Superstitious Traditions and Opinions of Men.</p>
                     <p>As for the Souls of the godly, they are at rest with Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Isai.</hi> 57.2. and as fixed as pillars in the house of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                     <p>And for the wicked, their Spirits are confin'd and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in Hell as in a Prison, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. there is a fixed Gulph betwixt them and the living, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.27, 28, 29, 30, 31.</p>
                     <p>What good offices are to be done by Spirits for us, the Angels are Gods Commission-Officers to do them, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.14. <hi>They are all ministring Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of Salvation</hi>: these are the Spirits sent forth to walk to and fro through the earth, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.10. their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry was <hi>emblematically</hi> represented in <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Vision, where they were seen ascending and descending as upon a Ladder, betwixt Heaven and Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12. Yea, their very name <hi>Angel,</hi> is a name of office, signifying a Messenger, or one sent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="269" facs="tcp:63760:151"/>And for the mischief done by Spirits in this World, the Scriptures ascribe that to the Devils: those unquiet Spirits have their Walks in this World, they compass the whole earth, and walk up and down in it, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.7. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. they can assume any shape, yea, I doubt not but he can act their Bodies when dead, as well as he did their Souls and Bodies when alive: how great his power is this way, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in what is so often done by him in the Bodies of <hi>Witches.</hi> They are not ordinarily therefore the Spirits of men, but other Spirits that appear to us.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) If God should ordinarily permit the Spirits of men inhabiting the other World, a liberty so frequently to visit this, what a gap would it open for <hi>Satan</hi> to beguile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the living!<note place="margin">

There hath been a great deal of Superstition and Idolatry already introduced under this pretence: he hath often personated Saints departed, and pretended himself to be the Ghost of some venerable person, whose love to the Souls of the people and care for their Salvation drew him from Heaven, to reveal some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Secret to them. Swarms of Errors, and superstitious and idolatrous Opinions and Practices, are this way convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the tricks and artifices of Satan among the Papists, which I will not blot my Paper withal: only I desire it may be considered, that if this were a thing so frequently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by God, as is pretended, upon what dangerous terms had he left his Church in this World, seeing he hath left no certain marks by which we may distinguish one Spirit from another, or a true Messenger from Heaven from a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit and pretended one.</p>
                     <p>But God hath tied us to the sure and standing rule of his Word, forbidding us to give heed to any other voice or spirit, leading us another way, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.19. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Gall.</hi> 1.8. It was therefore a discreet reply which one of the Ancients made, when in Prayer a Vision of <hi>Christ</hi> appeared to him, and told him, Thy Prayers are heard, for thou art worthy: The good man immediately clapt his hands upon his eyes and said, <hi>Nolo hic videre Christum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will not see Christ here, it is enough for me, that I shall behold him in Heaven.</hi>

                     <p>My Opinion upon the whole matter is this, that although it cannot be denied, but in some grand and extraordinary cases, as at the transfiguration, and Resurrection of Christ. God did, and perhaps sometimes though rarely may order or permit departed Souls to return into this World; yet for the most part I judge those Apparitions are not the Souls of the Dead, but other Spirits, and for the most part evil ones.</p>

                     <hi>Whether the separated Souls of the just in Heaven, have any converse, or communication with each other? and how that can be, seeing all the Organs and Instruments of speech and hearing are laid aside with their Bodies?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It seems impossible that separated or unbodied Spirits should converse together, seeing the instruments by which the thoughts are communicated from one to another, are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the Grave. Suppose the Tongue of a man to be cut out, his eyes and hands perished or made useless whilst the Soul remains in the Body: it may enjoy its own thoughts within it self; but it is impossible to signifie them to another by words or signs.</p>
                  <p>Or suppose a man in a deep sleep (wherein the Senses are only bound for a little time) he may indeed exercise his own fancy in a pleasant Dream, but another cannot understand how it is entertained; but in death the Senses are not bound but extinguished.</p>
                  <p>Beside, we must not think the felicity of the departed holy Souls to consist in mutual Converses one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in their ineffable Visions of God, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him. To him who is Omniscient, and understands their most inward thoughts, they can freely communicate them, and receive his, as well as pour forth their own love; but to do it to their fellow Creatures who see not as God doth, seems impossible,</p>
                  <p>Indeed it was never doubted, but after the Resurrection they shall both know and talk with one another in a more excellent and perfect manner than now they do; but till that time, the Reasons above seem to perswade us, that all the Converses above are only betwixt God and them, which indeed is enough to make them happy: and indeed, if this ability be allowed to separated Souls, it seems to render the Resurrection of their Bodies needless; for they are well enough without them. But certainly the Spirits of just men are not <hi>Mutes</hi>: such an August Assembly of holy and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirits, do not live together in their Fathers House
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:63760:154"/>
without mutual Converse and fellowship with each other, as well as with God.</p>
                  <p>That acute and judicious Divine, Mr. <hi>Ioseph Symonds,</hi> in the Epistle to his Book, entitled <hi>Sight, and Faith,</hi> expresseth himself about this matter thus.
<q>I often think (saith he) of the Communion of the Spirits of men, which certainly is more than many are acquainted with: though we act one upon another in our present state, by the help of sense; yet we are wrought and designed to a more excellent way. Angels and the Spirits of men made perfect, converse and trade in a mutual <hi>Communication,</hi> not without sense, but without such sense as ours. This, as eternal life begins here, and is found in some degrees in this Mortal State, though not in so visible appearances as to lie open to much observation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Angels good and bad do act upon our Spirits, and our Spirits hold converse with them, and with the Father of Spirits, which may be discerned in secret Parlies and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses betwixt them and us; much of this appears in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Psalms: and there passeth not only an inward speech, but there are invisible approaches, entertainments and touches, which <hi>Paul</hi> found when bound in the Spirit, and under the working of God, which wrought in him migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.29. it is also most certain that our Souls are not mute, and shut out from all mutual Traffick with each other, except what they have by the mediation of Senses.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Instances are found, (that as they say of two Needles toucht with the Loadstone) the Spirit of one at a distance hath found it self affected with the motion and state of another. And this we are all sensible of, that there is a strong desire in us to Communion of Spirits; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the way most ready and convenient to our bodily state is by sense, we are carried with much inclination to maintain intercourse of our minds and Spirits by sense; but as being made to a better way, our Souls are not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this present way, as being both painful, and short: we cannot give an exact Copy of our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Desires, Designs, Delights, and other affections by these two great Mediators of Communion, the <hi>Eye,</hi>
                        <pb n="276" facs="tcp:63760:155"/>
and the <hi>Ear:</hi> but because we are in so great a measure confin'd to this course, our Souls, as it were, stand in these two gates, to send and receive mutual Embassies each from other. Which way, as it is short in it self, so it is much shortned by distances, disaffections, impotencies, and disparities.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot imagine that men in the state of imperfection should have so many ways to communicate their minds, as by speaking, writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, that the very Birds and Beasts are by nature enabled to signifie to each other their Inclinations, and that the Spirits of just men which are the best of all humane Spirits; and that when made perfect too, which is the best and highest state attainable by them; should have none; but live at a greater disadvantage in this respect, than they did, or the very Birds and Beasts in this World do. The summ of my thoughts about this matter, I will lay down in the following <hi>Sections.</hi>

                        <hi>This Internal way of speaking and Communication among Spirits, is much more noble, perfect, and excellent, than that which is in use among us by words and signs: and that in two respects,</hi> viz.

                           <item>1. Of clearness.</item>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Spiritual Language is more clearly expressive of the mind and thoughts, than words, writings, or any other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal signs can be. The greatest Masters of Language do often cloud their meaning for want of words fit and full enough to express it: truth suffers by the Poverty and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of words: many Controversies are but meer strifes about words, and scufflings in the dark, by the mistakes of each others sense and meaning: few have the ability of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:63760:157"/>
their own meanings into apt, proper, and full expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and if they can, yet others to whom they speak, want an answerable ability of understanding, and clearness of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension to receive it. If we could discern the true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sense of things, just as it is in the mind of the Speaker or Writer, How many Controversies would be thereby quickly ended?</p>
                     <p>But Spirits unbodied so conveigh their sense and mind to one another, that there can be no mistakes: no darkning of Counsel, by words without knowledge; but one receives it just as it lies in the others mind.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Spiritual Language is more easie, and of quicker dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch. Some men have voluble Tongues, and are much more ready and presential than others, their Tongues are as the Pen of a ready Scribe: and others, no less ready with their hands, which keep pace with, yea, out-run the Tongue of the Speaker, as <hi>Martial</hi> notes,
<q>
                           <l>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Martial. Epig. lib. 14. Ep. 176.</hi>

                        </q>
Yet all this is but bungling work to the ready dispatch of Spirits, one act of the Will opens the Window to discern the mind of another clearly: so that the converse of Spirits must needs be more excellent in both respects, than any we are accustomed to, or acquainted with in this World. I will shut up this Question with</p>

You that are going to joyn that blessed Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, will even in this respect gain an invaluable advantage. 'Tis true, there is much of comfort in the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses of embodied, and imperfect Saints: 'tis sweet to fast and pray, to sigh and groan together; 'tis sweeter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and praise our God together. 'Tis sweet to talk of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with our faces thitherward: but alas! what is this to the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:63760:157"/>
converses that are among the Spirits of just men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect! With what melting hearts have we sometimes sate under the doctrine of the Gospel. How have our ears been chained with delight to the Preacher's lips whilst he hath been discoursing of those ravishing subjects, <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Heaven!</hi> But alas! How dry and dull a thing is the best of this, to the language of Heaven! Three things debase and spoil the communications of the Saints on Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the darkness, dulness, and frothiness thereof.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The darkness and ignorance of our understanding. How crude, weak, and indigested are our highest and purest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of spiritual things! We speak of them but as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. For alas, the vail is yet upon our faces. The Body of sin, and the Body of flesh cast a very dark sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow upon the world to come: But the apprehensions of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated Souls are most bright and clear. This darkness begets mistakes, mistakes beget so many quarrels and janglings that our fellowship on earth loseth at once both its profit and pleasure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is much dulness and deadness accompanying the Communion of Saints on earth, abundance of precious time is wasted among us in unprofitable silence, and when we engage in discourses of Heaven, that discourse is often little better than silence. Our words freeze betwixt our lips, and we speak not with that concernedness and warmth of Spirit which suits with such subjects.</p>
                     <p>It is not so among our brethren above: their affections are at the highest peg, giving glory to God in the highest.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To conclude, in the discourses of the best men on Earth, there is too much froth and vanity. Many words like water run away at the wast spout; but there, God is the Centre in which all terminates. O therefore let us long to be among the unbodied people. This World will never suit us with companions in all things agreeable to the desires of our hearts. The best company are got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the upper room: an hour there, is better than an Age below. What ever fellowship Saints leave on earth, they shall be sure to find better in Heaven.</p>

                  <p>We read, that when a good man in time of his sickness was told by his friends, that some hopeful signs of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery began now to appear; he answered, And must I

then return to this Body? I was as a sheep driven out of the Storm, almost to the Fold; and then driven back into the storm again: Or as a weary Traveller near his home, who must go back again to fetch something he had neglected: or as an <hi>Apprentice</hi> whose time was almost out, and then must begin a new Term. Of some others it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so noted, that the greatest infirmities they discovered upon their death-bed have been their too passionate desires to be dissolved, and their unsubmissiveness to Gods will in their longer stay in the Body. Now, the Bodies of the Saints being so cheerfully forsaken, and that only upon a foretaste of Heaven by Faith; how can it be thought they should find any inclination to a re-union, when they are so abundantly satisfied with the joys of his face in Heaven? Certainly the Body hath been no such pleasant habitation to the Soul that it should cast an eye or thought that way, when it is once delivered out of it. If it were burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some here, a thought of it would be loathsome there.</p>

'Tis true, it is not now delighted with meat and drink, with smells and sounds as it was wont to be: but then it must be considered, that it is happiness and perfection not to need them.

                     <p>THough death hath dissolv'd the Union, yet it hath not destroyed the relation betwixt the Soul and Body; that dust is more to it than all the dust of the whole earth. Hence it is that the whole person of a Believer is sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from that part of him, namely his Body which remains captivated by death in the grave. Hence 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.15. dead believers are called <hi>those that sleep,</hi> which must needs properly respect the Body, for the Soul sleeps not; and shews what a firm and dear relation still remains betwixt these absent Friends. Now we all know the mighty power of relation, if it be least among <hi>entities,</hi> yet surely it is one of the greatest things in the World in <hi>efficacy.</hi>

                     <p>THE regret, reluctancy, and sorrows expressed by the Soul at parting, do strongly argue its inclination to a re-union with it, when it is actually separated from it. For why should we surmise that the Soul which mourn'd and groan'd so deeply at parting; which clasp'd and embraced it so dearly and affectionately; which fought, strugled and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the passage with death every foot and inch of ground it got; and would not part with the Body till by plain force it was rent out of its arms: should not when absent, desire to see and enjoy its old and endeared friend again? Hath it lost its affection, though it continue its relation? thats ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry improbable. Or doth its advancement in Heaven make it regardless of its Body which lies in contempt and misery? that's an effect which Christs personal glory never produced in him towards us, nor a good mans perferment would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in him to his poor and miserable friends in this World, as we see in the case of <hi>Ioseph</hi> but now instanced in. It is therefore harsh and incongruous to suppose the Souls love to the Body was extinguished in the parting hour, and that now, out of sight, out of mind.</p>

                        </note>The objection doth not suppose any man to be totally free from all reluctancies and unwillingness to die.

But this their willingness to be gone arises from two other grounds, which make i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> consistent enough with its reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies at parting, and inclination to a second meeting.</p>
                     <list>
                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:63760:160"/>
                        <item>(1) This willingness to die, doth not suppose the Souls love to the Body to be utterly extinguished, but mastered and overpowered by another and stronger love. There is in every Christian a double love, one natural, to the Body, and the things below; the other supernatural, to Christ, and the things above; the latter doth not extinguish, though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and subdue the other. Love to the Body pulls back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, love to Christ pulls forward, and finally prevails. This is so consistent with it, that it supposes natural reluctation and unwillingness to part.</item>
                        <item>(2) The willingness of Gods people to be dissolved, must not be understood <hi>absolutely,</hi> but <hi>comparatively</hi>: In that sense the <hi>Apostle</hi> will be understood, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. <hi>We are confident I say, and willing rather to be absent from the Body, and present with the Lord.</hi> (i. e.) Rather than to live always a life of sin, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and absence from God. Death is not desireable in and for it self, but only as it is the Souls outlet from sin, and its inlet to God.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>So that the very best desire it but comparatively, and it is but few who find the love of this animal life subacted and overpowered by high raised acts of faith and love. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality even of good Souls feel strong renitencies, and suffer sharp conflicts at their dissolution. All which discovers with what lothness and unwillingness the Soul unclasps its arms to let go its Body. Now as <hi>Divines</hi> argue the frame of Christs heart in Heaven, toward his people on earth, from all those endearing passages and demonstrations of love he gave them at parting; so we here argue the continued love and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul to its Body after it is in Heaven, from the manifold demonstrations it gave of its affection to it in this World; especially in the parting hour. No conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in all the World, less than the more full fruition of God, and freedom from sin, could possibly have prevailed with it to quit the Body, though but for a time, and leave it in the dust. Which is our third Argument.</p>

                     <p>AND as the dolorous parting hour evidenceth it, so doth the joy with which it receives it again at the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. If it part from it so heavily, and meet it again with joy unspeakable; sure then it still retained much love for it, and desires to be re-espoused to it, in the interval. Now, that its meeting in the Resurrection is a day of joy to the Soul, is evident, because it is called <hi>the time of refreshment,</hi> Acts 3.19. And they <hi>awake with singing out of the dust,</hi> Isai. 26.19. If the direct and immediate scope of the <hi>Prophet</hi> point not (as some think it doth) at the Resurrection, yet it is allowed by all to be a very lively allusion to it; which is sufficient for my purpose. And indeed none that understands and believes the design and business of that day, can possibly doubt but there was reason enough to call it a time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment, a singing morning; for the Souls of the righteous come from Heaven with Christ, and the whole host of shouting Angels; not to be <hi>speclators</hi> only, but the <hi>subjects</hi> of that days triumph. They come to re-assume, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>espoused to their own Bodies, this being the appointed time for God to vindicate and rescue them from the tyrannical power of the Grave, to endow them with spiritual quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at their second marriage to their Souls, that in both parts they may be compleatly happy. O the joyful clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings and dear embraces betwixt them, who but themselves can understand! And by the way, this removes the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on forementioned, of the miseries and prejudices the Soul suffered in this world in and from the Body. For now it receives it a spiritual Body, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) so subdued to and fitted for the use of the Spirit, as never to impede, clog, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct its motions and inclinations any more, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. In this hope it parted from it, and with this consolation it now receives it again.</p>

                     <hi>IF our Souls and Bodies must be separated shortly, how patiently should we bear all lesser that may or will be made betwixt us and any other enjoyments in this World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No union is so intimate strict, and dear, as that betwixt your Souls and Bodies. All your relations and enjoyments in this World, hang looser from your Souls, than your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do; and if it be your duty patiently and submissively to suffer a painful parting pull from your Bodies; it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less your duty to suffer meekly and patiently a separation from other things, which are but a prelude to it, and a meer shadow of it. 'Tis good to put such cases to our selves in the midst of our pleasant enjoyments.</p>
                  <p>I have now many comfortable <hi>Relatives</hi> in the World, Wife, Children Kindred, and Friends; God hath made them pleasant to me, but he may bereave me of all these.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:63760:166"/>
Doth not Providence ring such changes all the World over! Are not all Kingdoms, Cities, and Towns full of the sighs and laments of Widows, Orphans, and Friends bereaved of their pleasant and useful Relations? But if God will have it so, 'tis our duty to bound our sorrows, remembring <hi>the time is short,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. In a few days we must be stript much nearer, even out of our own Bodies by death.</p>
                  <p>God may also separate betwixt me and my health by sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, so that the pleasure of this World shall be cut off from me; but sickness is not death, though it be a prelude and step towards it: I may well bear this with patience, who must submissively bear sharper pains than these ere long. Yea, and well may I bear this submissively, considering that by such imbittering, and weaning providences God is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me for a much easier dissolution, than if I should live at ease in the Body all my days, till death come to make so great and suddain a change upon me.</p>
                  <p>God may also separate betwixt me and my liberty by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint. It hath been the lot of the best men that ever were in the World, and if it should be ours also, we should not be much startled at it, considering these Bodies of ours must be shortly pent up in a straiter, darker, and more loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some place of confinement, than any prison in this World can be. The grave is a darker place, <hi>Iob</hi> 17.13. And your abode there will be longer, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11.8.</p>
                  <p>These and all other our outward enjoyments are separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, and its good thus to alleviate our loss of them.</p>

                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:63760:167"/>There is the greatest reason that our minds be there where our Souls are to be for ever. A spiritual mind will be found <hi>possible, congruous, sweet,</hi> and <hi>evidential</hi> of our interest in that glory, to all those holy Souls who are preparing, and designed for it.</p>
                  <p>First, it is <hi>possible,</hi> notwithstanding the clogs and entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Body, to be heavenly minded. Others have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.20. Two things make an heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation possible to men, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The natural abilities of the Mind.</item>
                        <item>2. The gracious principles of the Mind.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The natural abilities of the mind which can in a minutes time dispatch a nimble messenger to Heaven, and mount its thoughts from this to that World in a trice. The power of cogitation is a rich endowment of the Soul, such as no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature on earth is participant of. Though spiritual thoughts be not the natural growth of the Soul, yet thoughts capable of being spiritualized are. And without this ability of projecting thoughts, all intercourse must have been cut off.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The gracious principles implanted in the Soul do actually incline the mind, and mount its thoughts heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Yea, this will prove more than a possibility of a conversation in Heaven; whilst Saints tabernacle on earth in Bodies of flesh, it will almost prove an impossibility that it should be otherwise. For these spiritual principles setting the bent and tendency of the heart heaven-ward, we must act against the very law of our new Nature when we place our affections elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A mind in heaven is most <hi>congruous,</hi> decorous, and comely for those that are the enrolled inhabitants of that heavenly City. Where should a Christians <hi>love</hi> be, but where his <hi>Lord</hi> is? Our <hi>hearts</hi> and our <hi>homes</hi> do not use to be long asunder. It becomes you so to think and so to speak now, as those who make account to be shortly sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Allelujahs</hi> before the throne.</p>

                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:63760:167"/>Thirdly, 'Tis most <hi>sweet</hi> and delightful: no pleasure in all this World comparable to this pleasure, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. <hi>To be spiritually minded is life and peace.</hi> 'Tis a young Heaven born in the Soul, in its way thither.</p>

            <p>THis Doctrine of the separation of the Spirits of the Just from their Bodies, as it lyes before you in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, affords a singular help to all the people of God, to entertain lovely and pleasant thoughts of that day, to make death not only an unregretted, but a most pleasant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable thing to their Souls.</p>
            <p>I know there is a pure, simple, natural fear of death, from which you must not expect to be perfectly freed by all the Arguments in the World. And there is a reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial awful fear of death, which it would be your prejudice and loss to have destroyed. You will have a natural, and ought to have a reverential fear of death: the one flows from your <hi>sensitive,</hi> the other from your <hi>sanctified</hi> nature.</p>
            <p>But it is a third sort of fear which doth you all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, a fear springing in gracious Souls out of the weakness of their Graces, and the strength of their unmortified af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. A fear arising partly out of the darkness of our <hi>minds,</hi> and partly out of the sensuality and earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our <hi>hearts</hi>; this fear is that which so convulseth our Souls when death is near and imbitters our lives, even whilst it is at a distance. He that hath been over-heated in his affections to this World, and over-cooled by diversions and temptations, neglects and intermissions, to that World; cannot chuse but give an unwilling shrug, if not a frightful screech at the appearance of death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:63760:168"/>And this being the sad case of too many, good and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Souls for the main; and there being so few even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst serious Christians that have attained to that <hi>cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> and <hi>complacence</hi> in the thoughts of death which the Apostle speaks of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. to be both <hi>confident</hi> and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling rather to be absent from the Body, and to be present with the Lord; I will from this discourse fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them with some special assistance therein. But withal, I must tell you upon what great disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages I am here to dispute with your fears, so strong is the current of natural and vicious fear, that except a special hand of God back and set on the Arguments that shall be urged, they will be as easily swept away before it, as so many Straws by a rapid Torrent; nor will it be to any more purpose to oppose my breath to them, than to the Tides and Waves of the Sea.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I am fully convinced by long and often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience how unsteady, and inconstant the frames and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the best hearts are; and that if it be not full home, yet it is next to an impossibility to fix them in such a temper as this I aim at, is. Where is that man to be found, who after the revolutions of many years, and in those years, various dispensations of providence without him, altering his condition, and greater variety of temptations within; can yet say, notwithstanding all these various aspects and positions, his heart hath still held one steddy and invariable tenour and course.</p>
            <p>Alas, there be very few (if any) of such sound and Athletick temper of mind, whose pulse beats with an even stroke, through all inequalities of condition, alike free and willing at one time, as another, to be uncloathed of the Body, and to be with Christ. This heighth of faith, and depth of mortification; this strength of love to Christ, and ardour of holy desire, are degrees of grace to which very few attain.</p>
            <p>The case standing thus, it is no more than needs, to urge all sorts of Arguments upon our timorous and unsteady hearts, and it's like to prove an hard and difficult task to bring the heart but to a quiet and unregretting submission to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God herein, though submission be one of the lowest steps of duty in this case.</p>

               <p>But if separation from the Body be (as it is) an enemy to Nature, and there be no possibility to extinguish natural aversation; to what purpose is it to argue and perswade, where there is no expectation of Success?</p>

                  <head>Solution.</head>
                  <p>Death is considerable two ways by the people of God,
<list>
                        <item>1. As an Enemy to Nature,</item>
                        <item>2. As a <hi>medium</hi> to Glory.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we consider it simply in it self, as an Enemy to Nature, there is nothing in it for which we should desire it: but if we consider it as a <hi>medium</hi> or passage into glory, yea, the only ordinary way through which all the Saints must pass out of this into a better state, so it will appear not only tolerable, but desirable to prepared Souls. Were there not a <hi>shore</hi> of glory on the other side of these black Waters of death, for my own part, I should rather chuse to live meanly, than to die easily. If both parts were to perish
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:63760:169"/>
at death, there were no reason to perswade one to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deliver up the other. It were a madness for the Soul to desire to be dissolv'd, if it were so far from being better out of the Body, than in it, that it should have no being at all. But Christians, let me tell you, death is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Bar,</hi> that it is a <hi>Bridge</hi> in your way to glory, and you are never like to come thither but by passing over it: except therefore you will look beyond it, you will never see any desireableness in it. <hi>I desire to be dissolv'd</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>and to be with Christ; which is far better.</hi> To be with <hi>Death</hi> is <hi>sad,</hi> but to be with <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>sweet</hi>: to endure the <hi>pains</hi> of <hi>death</hi> is <hi>doleful</hi>; but to see the <hi>face</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>joyful.</hi> To part with your pleasant <hi>habitations</hi> is <hi>irkesome</hi>; but to be lodged in the heavenly <hi>Mansions</hi> is most <hi>delightful.</hi> A <hi>part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hour</hi> with dear Relations is <hi>cutting,</hi> but a <hi>meeting hour</hi> with Jesus Christ is <hi>transporting.</hi> To be rid of your own <hi>Bodies</hi> is not <hi>pleasing</hi>: but to be rid of <hi>sin</hi> and that for ever; What can be more pleasing to a gracious Soul?</p>
                  <p>You see then in what sense I present death as a desirable thing to the people of God. And therefore seeing nature teacheth us (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks) to put the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant comeliness upon the uncomely parts; suffer me to dress up death in its best ornaments, and present it to you in the following Arguments, as a beautiful and comely object of your conditional and well regulated desires.

               <p>IF upon a fair and just account there shall appear to be more gain to Believers in <hi>Death,</hi> than there is in <hi>Life</hi>: reason must needs vote death to be better to them that are in Christ, than life can be; and consequently it should be desireable in their eyes.</p>
               <p>'Tis a clear dictate of reason in case of choice to chuse that which is best for us. Who is there that freely exercises reason and choice together, that will not do so?</p>
               <p>What <hi>Merchant</hi> will not part with an hundred pounds worth of Glass <hi>Beads</hi> and <hi>Pendents,</hi> for a Tun of Gold? A few <hi>Tinsell</hi> Toyes, for as many rich <hi>Diamonds? Mercatura

               <p>Now, if you will be tried and determined by Gods Book of <hi>Rates,</hi> then the case is determined quickly, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage appears exceedingly upon deaths side, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.21. <hi>To me to live, is Christ; and to die, is gain.</hi>

                  <p>True, it might be so to <hi>Paul,</hi> who was eminent in grace, and ripe for glory; but it may be loss to others who have not attained the heighth of his holiness, or assurance.</p>

                     <head>Sol.</head>
                     <p>The true and plain sense of the Objection is this, whether Heaven and Christ be as much gain to him that enjoys it, though he be behind others both in grace, and obedience; as it is to them who are more eminent in grace, and have done and suffered more for its sake? and let it be determined by your selves: but if your meaning be, that <hi>Paul</hi> was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for death, and so are not you: his work and course was almost comfortably finished, and so is not yours: his death therefore must needs be gain to him, but it may be loss to you; even the loss of all that you are worth for ever.</p>
                     <p>To this I say, the Wisdom of God orders the time of his peoples death, as well as all other Circumstances about it: and in this, your hearts may be at perfect rest, That being in Christ you can never die to your loss, die when you will. I know you will reply, that if your Union with Christ were clear, the Controversie were ended: but then you must also consider, they are as safe who die by an act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency upon Christ, as those that die in the fullest assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their interest in him.</p>
                     <p>And beside, your Reluctancies and Aversations to death, are none of your way to assurance; but such a strong aversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to sin, and such a vehement desire after, and love to Christ as can make you willing to quit all that is dear and desireable to you in this World, for his sake, is the very next door or step to assurance, and if the Lord bring your

hearts to this frame, and fix them there, it is not like you will be long without it.</p>

Here's life with the most weighty and desireable benefits of it laid in one scale, and he lays <hi>death,</hi> and probably a violent death too; for of that he speaks to them afterwards in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.17. thus he fills the Scales, and the Balance breaks on deaths side, yea, it comes down with a <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <q>I am thy House, thy delightful habitation, the House in which thou hast dwelt from the first moment of thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and never lodgedst one Night in any other: every Room in me hath one way or another been a Banquetting-room for thy entertainment, a Room of pleasure: all my Senses have been <hi>Purveyors</hi> for thy delight: my Members have all of them been thine Instruments and Servants to execute thy Commands and Pleasure; if thou and I part, it must be in a showre: thou shalt feel such pains, such tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling throes, such deep emphatical groans, such Sweats, such Agonies as thou never felt'st before. For Death hath somewhat of anguish peculiar to it self, and which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, though guessed at by the Living. Beside, when ever thou leavest me, thou leavest all that is and hath been comfortable to thee in this World: thy House shall know thee no more, <hi>Iob</hi> 7.10. thy Lands, thy Money; thy Trade, which hath cost thee so many careful thoughts, and yielded thee so many Refreshments, shall be thine no longer: Death will strip thee out of all these, and leave thee naked.</q>

But if thou wilt be gone, all these must be left exposed, God knows to what Wants, Abuses, and Miseries: for I can do nothing for them or my self, if once thou leave me. Thus it charms and pleads: thus it lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as it were violent hands upon the Soul, and saith, O my Soul, thou shalt not depart. It hangs about it much as the Wife and Children of good <hi>Galeacius Carracciolus</hi> did about him, when he was leaving <hi>Italy</hi> to go to <hi>Geneva</hi> (a lively Emblem of the Case before us.) It saith to the Soul as <hi>Ioab</hi> did to <hi>David,</hi> thou hast shamed my face this day, in that thou lovest thine Enemy Death, and hatest me thy friend. O my Soul, my Life, my Darling, my Dear and only one, let nothing but unavoidable necessity part thee and me. All this the Flesh can plead, and a great deal

                  <p>Let us in the next place weigh the Pleas and Reasons, which, notwithstanding all this, do overpower and prevail with the Believing Soul to be gone, and quit its own Body, and return no more to the Elementary World.</p>
                  <p>And thus the power of Faith and Love, enable it to reply.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>My dear Body, the Companion and Partner of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Troubles in the days of my Pilgrimage on earth, great is my love, and strong are the Bonds of my affections to thee. Thou hast been tenderly, yea, excessively beloved by me: my cares and fears for thee have been unexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and nothing but the love of Jesus Christ is strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to gain my consent to part with thee: thy interest in my affections is great, but as great as it is, and as much as I prize thee, I can shake thee off, and thrust thee aside to go to Christ.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Nor may this seem absurd or unreasonable, considering that God never designed thee for a <hi>Mansion,</hi> but only a temporary <hi>Tabernacle</hi> to me: 'tis true I have had some comfort during my abode in thee, but I enjoyed those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts only <hi>in</hi> thee, not <hi>from</hi> thee; and many more I might have enjoyed, hadst thou not been a snare and a clog to me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>'Tis thou that hast eaten up my time, and distracted my thoughts, ensnared my affections, and drawn me under much sin and sorrow. However though we may weep over each other as <hi>Accessories</hi> to the sins and miseries we have drawn upon our selves, yet in this is our joint relief that the Blood of Christ hath cleansed us both from all sin.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>And therefore I can part the more easily and comfortably from thee, because I part in hope to receive and enjoy thee in a far better condition than I leave thee. It is for both our interest to part for a time: for mine, because I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be freed and delivered from sin and sorrow, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately obtain rest with God, and the satisfaction of all my
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:63760:171"/>
desires in his presence and enjoyment, which there is no other way to obtain, but by separation from thee: and why should I live a groaning burthened restless life always, to grantifie thy fond and irrational desires? If thou lovedst me, thou would'st rejoice, and not repine at my happiness. Parents willingly part with their Children at the greatest distance for their preferment, how dearly soever they love them: and dost thou envy or repine at mine? I lived many Months a suffocating obscure life with thee in the Womb, and neither thou nor I had ever tasted or experienced the Comforts of this World, and the various Delights of sense, if we had not cast the <hi>Secundine,</hi> and strugled hard for an entrance into this World. And now we are here, alas, though thou art contented to abide, I live in thee, but as we both lived in the Womb, an obscure and uneasie, and unsuitable life. Thou canst feed upon material bread, and delight thy self amidst the variety of sensitive Objects thou findest here; but what are all these things to me? I cannot subsist by them; that which is food to thee, is but Chaff, Wind, and Vanity to me. If I stay with thee, I shall be still sinning, and still groaning: when I leave thee, I shall be immediately freed from both, and arrive at the summ and perfection of all my hopes, desires, and whatsoever I have aimed at, and laboured for, in all the duties of my life. Let us therefore be content to part.</q>

time appointed: I take not an everlasting farewel of thee, but depart for a time, that I may receive thee for ever. To conclude, there is an unavoidable necessity of our parting; whether willing, or unwilling, we must be separated: but the consent of my will to part with thee for the enjoyment of Jesus Christ, will be highly acceptable to God, and as a lump of Sugar to sweeten the bitter cup of death to us both.</q>

               <p>TO be weary of the Body upon the pure account and reason of our hatred of sin, and longing desires after Jesus Christ, argues strongly grace in truth, and grace in strength: it is both the <hi>Test</hi> of our sincerity, and the <hi>measure</hi> of our attainment, and <hi>maturity</hi> of grace; and upon both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts highly covetable by all the people of God.</p>
               <p>It is so great an evidence of the truth of grace, that the Scriptures have made it the <hi>descriptive periphrasis</hi> of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: so we find it in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. the Crown of life is there promised to all them that love the appearance of Christ: (<hi>i.e.</hi>) those that love to think of it, that delight to steep their thoughts in Subjects belonging to the other World: and cast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

O said, Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>; <q>That Christ would make long strides O that he would fold up the Heavens as an old Cloak, and shovel time and days out of the way!</q>
Such desires as these can spring from none but
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:63760:172"/>
gracious and renewed Souls: for Nature is wholly disaffected to a removal hence upon such Motives and Considerations as these: if others wish at any time for death, 'tis but in a Pet, a present passion provoked by some intollerable anguish, or great distress of nature. But to look, and long, and hasten to the other World, out of a weariness of sin, and an hearty willingness to be with Christ, it supposes necessarily a deep-rooted hatred of sin, abhorring it more than death it self, the greatest of natural evils: and a real sight of things invisible by the eye of Faith, without which it is impossible any mans heart should be thus framed and tempered.</p>
               <p>And as it evidenceth the truth, so also the strength and maturity of Grace: for alas! How many thousands of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls that love the Lord Jesus in sincerity, are to be found quite below this temper of mind. O 'tis but here and there one among the Lords own people that have reached this height and eminence of Faith and Love: it is with the fruits of the Spirit just as it is with the fruits of the earth; some are green and raw, others are ripe and mellow: the first stick fast on the Branches; you may shake and shake again, and not one will drop; or as those fruits that grow in the Hedges with their Coats and Integuments enwrapping them, as <hi>Nuts,</hi> &amp;c. You may try your strength upon them, and sooner break your Nails, than disclose and separate them; so fast and close do their husks stick to them: but when time and the influences of Heaven have ripened and brought them to their perfection, the <hi>Apples</hi> drop into your hands without the least touch, and the <hi>Nut</hi> falls out of its Case of its own accord: So, much so, doth the Soul part from its Body when it is maturated, and come to its strength and vigour.</p>

               <p>IT may greatly prevail upon the Will and Resolution of a Believer to adventure boldly and chearfully upon Death, that our Bodies, of which we are bereaved and deprived by death, shall be most certainly, and advantageously restored to us by the Resurrection. The Resurrection of the Dead,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:63760:173"/>
is the encouragement and consolation of the dying. The more our Faith is established in the Doctrine of the Resurrection, the more we shall surmount the fears of dissolution. If <hi>Paul</hi> urged it as an Argument to reconcile <hi>Philemon</hi> to his Servant <hi>Onesimus, v.</hi> 15. That he therefore departed for a season, that <hi>Philemon</hi> might receive him for ever: the same Argument may reconcile every Believer to death, and take off the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Soul against it. You shall surely receive your Bodies again, and enjoy them for ever.</p>
               <p>Now the Doctrine of the Resurrection is as sure in it self, as it is comfortable to us: the depth and strength of its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, fully answers to the height and sweetness of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation: be pleased to try the two pillars thereof, and see which of them may be doubted or shaken, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.29. <hi>You err</hi> (saith Christ to the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who denied this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) <hi>not knowing the Scriptures and the Power of God</hi>: this is the ground and root of their error, not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the Power of God: <hi>q d.</hi> did you know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scriptures of God, and the Power of God; you would never question this Doctrine of the Resurrection, which is built upon them both.

                     </gap>o,</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of God convince all that know and believe them, that it <hi>must be so:</hi> as for his Power, Who can doubt it? At the Command and <hi>fiat</hi> of God, the Earth brought forth every living Creature after his kind, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.24, 25. at his Command <hi>Lazarus</hi> came forth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.43. And was there not as much difficulty in either of these, as in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection? By this Power our Souls were quickened and raised from the death of sin and guilt, to the Spiritual life of Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. and is it not as easie to raise a dead Body, as a dead Soul? But what stand I arguing in so plain a Case, when we are assured this mighty Power is able to subdue all things to it self, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21.</p>
               <p>And then, for his promise, that it shall be so, What can be plainer! See 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.15, 16. <hi>This we say unto you by the Word of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>i.e.</hi>) In the Name, or Auhority of the Lord, and by Commission and Warrant from him, he first opens his Commission, shews his Credentials, and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:63760:173"/>
then publishes the comfortable Doctrine of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Saints preheminence to all others therein.</p>
               <p>Well then, what remains in death to fright and scare a Believer? is it our parting with these Bodies? Why, it is not for ever that we part with them; as sure as the power and promises of God are true, firm and sufficient to accomplish it, we shall see and enjoy them again. This comforted <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 19.25, 26. over all his diseases, when of all his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that once he had, he could not say, my Friends, my Children, my Estate; yet then he could say, my <hi>Redeemer.</hi> When he looked upon a poor, wasted, withered loathsome Body of his own, and saw nothing but a Skeleton, an Image of death; yet then could he see it a glorious Body by view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it believingly in this glass of the Resurrection. So then, all the damage we can receive by death, is but the absence of our Bodies for a time, during which time, the Covenant-relation betwixt God and them holds good and firm, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. He therefore will take care of them, and in due time restore them with marvellous improvements, and endowments to us again, divested of all their infirmities, and cloathed with Heavenly qualities and perfection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.43, 44. And in the mean time the Soul attains its rest and happiness and satisfaction in the blessed God.</p>

               <p>THE consideration of what we part from, and what we go to, should make the <hi>medium</hi> by which we pass from so much evil, to so great good, lovely and desireable in our eyes, how unpleasing or bitter soever it be in it self.</p>

It doth that for the Saints which all their graces, and duties, all their mercies and afflictions could never do.

               <p>All Weeping, all Praying, all Believing, all Hearing, all Sacraments, all the means and instruments in the World, cannot do what death will do for thee. One dying hour will do what ten thousand praying hours never did, nor could do. In this hour the design of all those hours is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished; as he that is dead by mortification is at present freedom from sin, in respect of imputation and dominion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.7. so he that being justified and mortified is dead
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:63760:174"/>
naturally; is immediately freed from the very indwelling and existence of sin in him. We read of the washing of the Robes of the Saints in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. The blood of the Lamb cleanseth them from every spot, but it doth it gradually. The last spot of guilt indeed was fetcht out by one act of justification, but the last spot filth is not fetcht out till the time of their dissolution, when they are come out of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies of death (which the Scripture calls great tribulation) then and not till then are they perfectly cleansed. Sin brought in death, and death carries out sin.</p>
               <p>O what a pure lovely shining Creature is the separated Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Just man!

The life we now live is a groaning life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. where is the Christian that if his inside could be seen, and his heart laid naked; would not be found wounded from many hands? From the hand of God, of Enemies, of Friends, of Satan: but especially by the hands of its own Corruptions. Christ our Head was stiled <hi>a man of sorrows,</hi> from the multitude of his Sorrows; and it is the lot of all his to be in a state of sorrow in the Body. <hi>In the World</hi> (saith he) <hi>you shall have trouble.</hi> When I consider how often the Candle of Sorrow is held to the thread of life; I justly wonder how it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to such a length. What Friend, what Enjoyment had we ever in this World, from which no sorrow, nay, many Sorrows have not sprung up to us? And if the best Comforts bring forth Sorrows, What do the worst things we meet with here, bring forth? I suppose, there are many thousands of God's People this day in the World, that have as much reason to assume the same new Name that <hi>Naomi</hi> did, and say, call me <hi>Marah.</hi> Look as Day and Night di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide all time betwixt them; so do our Comforts and our Sorrows; only with this difference, That our Nights of Sorrow like Winter Nights, are long, cold, and dark; and our days of Comfort short, and frequently over-cast.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:63760:175"/>But when we put off these Bodies, we put off our mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Garments with them, and shall never sorrow any more: thenceforth God wipes away all tears from his Peoples eyes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. and that is not all, but they enter into their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Joy, even fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore. Groans are turned into Triumphs, and Sighs and Tears into joyful Acclamations and Songs of praise. O that we were once made sensible throughly of the advantages that come by this exchange.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From entangling Temptations, into everlasting Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 'Tis this Body, and the interest, and concerns of it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Satan raises most of his Batteries against our Souls: 'tis our Flesh that causeth our Soul to sin: and whilst the Soul dwells in the Body, it is within Satans reach to tempt and defile and trouble it. O what grievous things do the best Souls endure and suffer on this account?</p>
               <p>Temptations are of two sorts: Ordinary and mediate by Satans exciteing and manageing our Corruptions, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Objects to them; or extraordinary and immediate, like fiery darts shot immediately out of Hell into the Soul, which puts it all into a flame and Combustion: Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer you read in <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.14. the latter in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of the one and other the People of God are weary of their lives: think what a grief it must be to a Soul that loves God, to feel in it self such things as militate against and wound the Name and Honour of God, which is, and ought to be dearer to it than its life.</p>
               <p>But by the door of Death every gracious Soul makes it escape from the tempting power of Satan: he can no more touch or affect the Soul with any temptation, than we can batter the Body of the Sun with Snow-balls: for as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan can have no access to that place of Blessedness, where the Souls of the Saints are; so if he could, he can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them to fasten a temptation upon. The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> give this as the reason, why the Saints in Heaven are impecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because all their thoughts and affections are everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed in, and imployed about the blessed God; whose face they continually behold in Glory.</p>

                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:63760:175"/>4. From distressing Persecutions into full and perfect rest. As Death sets us free from the Power of Satan, so from the reach of all Persecutors, <hi>There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest:</hi> as it is <hi>in Iob</hi> 3.17. The price of one <hi>Ahab</hi> who had sold himself to work wickedness, was a stock sufficient to purchase many years trouble to all <hi>Israel,</hi> 1. <hi>King</hi> 18.17. <hi>Wicked men are as the unquiet troubled Sea, which cannot rest,</hi> Isai. 57.20. They cannot rest from troubling the Saints, till they cease to be wicked, or to live: when God puts out the Candle of their lives, they are silent in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9. And when God puts out the Candle of our life, we are at rest, though they rage never so much in this World. Death is the Saints <hi>quietus est</hi>; their full and final discharge from persecuting Enemies. When we are dying, we may say, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 9.6. <hi>O thou Enemy, Destructions are come to a perpetual end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God may put an end to these Persecutions before Death, and such a time according to promise is to be expected, <hi>when our officers shall be peace, and our Exactors Righteousness,</hi> Isa. 60.17. but if the accomplishment of the promise be reserved for Ages to come, and we must spend our days under the oppression of the wicked; yet this is our comfort, we know when we shall be far enough out of their reach.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From pinching wants to universal Supplies. This is the day in which the Lord abundantly satisfies the desires, and supplies the needs of all his people: there are two sorts of wants upon the People of God, <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Spiritual wants are the just Complaints of all gracious Souls. You read, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.10. of that which is lacking in the Faith of the Saints: there are none but find many things lacking to the perfection of every Grace: Our <hi>knowledge</hi> of God wants <hi>clearness</hi> and efficacy: Our <hi>Love</hi> to God <hi>fervour</hi> and <hi>constancy</hi>: our <hi>Faith</hi> wants <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>stability</hi>: Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness mixes it self with our knowledge, deadness with our love, Unbelief with the purest acts of Faith. Go where you will, you shall find Gods People every where complaining of their Spiritual wants; One of a dark head, another of a dead heart, another of a treacherous Memory. Thus they are loading one another with their Complaints.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:63760:176"/>Temporal; outward wants pinch hard also upon many of Gods People: the greatest number of them consist of the Poor of this World, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.5. Those whose Souls are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged and acquitted by God, whose Debts are paid by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, may yet be intangled in a brake of Cares and Troubles in the World, and not know which way to turn themselves in their straits and difficulties. But by death the Saints pass from all their wants inward and outward to a state of compleat satisfaction, where nothing is lacking: from that day all their Spiritual wants are supplied, for they are now arrived to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, to a perfect man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. Now that which is perfect is come, and all that was in part is done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10.</p>
               <p>And for outward wants they shall feel them no more: for putting off the Body, we must needs put off all cares and concerns about it. <hi>Meats for the Belly, and the Belly for Meats, God shall destroy both it and them,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.13.</p>
               <p n="6">6. From distracting fears, into highest security and rest of thoughts for ever more. The fears of God's People are either about their Souls or about their Bodies: the fears they have about their Souls are inexpressible. Two things especially exercise their fears about their Souls. (1) Whether they be really united to Christ. (2) Whether they shall be able to continue and persevere in the ways of Christ to the end: they are afraid of their <hi>sincerity</hi> and of their <hi>stability</hi>: and these fears accompany many of Gods People from their Regeneration to their Dissolution. O what would they not give, what would they not do, yea, what would they not endure to get full satisfaction in those things! Every working of Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, every discovery made by Temptation, puts them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fright, and makes them question all that ever was wrought in them.</p>
               <p>And as their fears are great about the inward man, so also about the outward man; especially when such bloody pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations seem to be making by the same Enemies that have acted such, and so many bloody Tragedies already in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:63760:176"/>But at death they enter into perfect peace and security, <hi>Isai</hi> 57.2. No wind of fear shall ever ruffle and disturb their Souls, and put them into a storm any more.</p>
               <p n="7">7. From deluding shadows into substantial good. This World is the World of Shadows, and delusive appearances. Here we are imposed upon and baffled by empty and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Vanities. All we have here, is little else but a Dream: at death the Soul awakes out of its Dream, and finds it self in the World of Realities, where it feeds upon substantial good to satisfaction, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17.15.</p>
               <p>Now the advantages accrewing to the Soul by death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so great, and many; though the <hi>Medium</hi> be harsh and ungrateful in it self, yet there is all the reason in the World, we should covet it for the benefits that come by it.</p>

               <p>THe foretasts we have had of Heaven already in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, should make all the Saints long to be unbodied for the full and perfect fruition of that Joy; seeing it cannot be fully and perfectly enjoyed by the Soul, till it hath put off the Body by death.</p>
               <p>That there are Praelibations, First-fruits, and Earnests of future glory given at certain seasons to Believers in this life, is put beyond all doubting, not only by Scripture-Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but frequent experiences of God's People. I speak not only with the Scriptures, but with the clear experience of many Saints; when I say, there are to be felt and tasted, even here in the Body, the Earnests of our Inheritance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The first-fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.23. <hi>The sealing of the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 1.13. <hi>The very Ioy of the Lord,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. of the same kind, though in a remisser degree with that of the glorified.</p>
               <p>That the fulness of this joy cannot be in us whilst we ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle in Bodies of flesh, is as plain. When <hi>Moses</hi> desired a sight of that face which the spirits of just men made perfect, do continually behold and adore, the Answer was, <hi>No Man can see my face and live,</hi> Exod. 33.18, 19, 20. <hi>q. d. Moses,</hi> Thou askest a great thing, and understandest not how unable thou
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:63760:177"/>
art to support that which thou desirest: should I shew thee my Glory in this compounded state thou now art, it would confound thee, and swallow thee up. Nature, as now constituted, cannot support such a weight of Glory: a Ray, a glimpse of this light overpowers Man, and breaks such a clay Vessel to pieces: which is the reason why the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction must intervene betwixt this state, and that of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies glorification.</p>
               <p>And it is not to be doubted, but one main end and reason why these foretasts of Heaven are given us in the Body, is to embolden the Soul to venture through death it self for the full enjoyment of those Delights and Pleasures. They are like the Grapes of <hi>Eshcol</hi> to the faint-hearted <hi>Israelites</hi>; or the sweet Wines of <hi>Italy</hi> to the <hi>Gauls,</hi> which once tasted made them restless till they had conquered that good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where they grew, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. We which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we our selves, do groan within our selves, waiting for the Adoption, <hi>viz.</hi> The Redemption of our Bodies.</p>
               <p>Well then, reflect seriously upon those sweet tastes that you have had of God and his love in your sincere and secret addresses to him, and converses with him. What an holy forgetfulness of all things in this World hath it wrought! How insipid and tastless hath it rendered the sweetest Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-enjoyments! What willingness to be dissolved for a more full fruition of it! God this way brings Heaven nigh to your Souls, out of design to overcome your Reluctancies at death, through which you must pass to the enjoyment of it. And after all those sights and tastes both of the truth and goodness of that state, shall we still reluctate and hang back, as if we had never tasted how good the Lord is! O you may justly question, whether you ever had a real taste of Jesus Christ; if that taste do not kindle Coals of fire in your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes: I mean ardent longings to be with him, and to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with his love.</p>
               <p>If you have been priviledged with a taste of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:63760:177"/>
disgrace and reproach upon the blessed God, as thinking there is more bitterness in death, than there is sweetness in his presence. Yea, it argues the strength of that unbelief which still remains in your hearts, that after so many tastes, and tryals as you have had, you still remain doubtful and hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating about the certainty and reality of things invisible.</p>
               <p>O what adoe hath God with his froward and peevish Children! If he had only revealed the future state to us in his Word, as the pure Object of Faith, and required <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>IT should greatly fortifie the People of God, against the fears of Dissolution, to consider that death can neither destroy the being of their Souls by Annihilation, nor the hopes and expectations they have of blessedness by disappointment and frustration,</hi> Prov. 14.32. <hi>The Righteous hath hope in his death.</hi> Though all earthly things fail at death (upon which account dying is expressed by failing, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.19.)

It will not come home in the greatest Storm, that can beat upon the Soul. For (1) God hath foreknown and chosen them to Salvation before the World was, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2, <hi>And this Foundation of God standeth sure, having this Seal, the Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19.

Namely, by the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Righteousness of Christ to them, in respect of which they are as righteous, as if in their own persons they had perfectly obeyed all its Commands, or suffered all its Penalties. Thus death loseth its sting, its Curse, and killing power over the Souls of all that are in Christ. (3) God hath sanctified their natures, which sanctification is not only a sure evidence of their <hi>Election,</hi> and <hi>Iustification,</hi> 2 Thes. 1.5, 6.

               <p>IT may greatly encourage and embolden the People of God to die, considering, that though at death they take the last sight, and view of all that is dear to them on earth; yet then they are admitted to the first immediate sight and blessed Vision of God, which will be their happiness to all eternity.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was upon his supposed Death-bed, he complained, <hi>Isa.</hi> 38.11. <hi>I shall see Man no more with the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the World.</hi> We shall see thenceforth these Corporeal People no more. We shall see our Habitations and dwelling places no more, <hi>Iob</hi> 7.9, 10, 11.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:63760:180"/>
Many consciences will then be wounded and wasted. Many scandals and rocks of offence will be rolled into the way of godliness. Christ will be exposed and put to open shame. Should we only be spectators of such Tragedies as these, it were enough to overwhelm a gracious and tender heart: but what upright heart is there without fears, and jealousies of being brought under the guilt of these evils in it self, as well as the shame and grief for them in others? O it were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times better for you to die in the purity and integrity of your consciences; than to protract a miserable life without them. O think what a world it is that you are like to leave behind you in respect of sin to come.</p>
               <p>And as there are many evils of sin to come; so there are many evils of sufferings coming on, <hi>The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come, and Israel shall know it.</hi> Hos. 9.7.

               <p>YOur fixed aversation and unwillingness to die, will provoke God to imbitter your lives with much more affliction than you have yet felt, or would feel if your hearts were more mortified and weaned in this point.</p>
               <p>You cannot think of your own deaths with pleasure, no nor yet with patience: Well, take heed, lest this draw down such troubles upon you, as shall make you at last to say with <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>My Soul is weary of my life.</hi> An expression much like that, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Anguish is come upon me, because my life is whole in me.</hi> My Soul is hardened, or become cruel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my life as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> renders it.</p>
               <p>There is a twofold weariness of life, one from an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of spirit, a noble principle, the ardent love of Jesus Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ.</hi> Another from the meer pressures of affliction and anguish of Spirit, under heavy and successive stroaks from the hand of God and men. Is it not more excellent and desireable to groan for death under a pressure of love to Christ, than of afflictions from Christ?</p>
               <p>I am convinced that very many of our afflictions come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this score and account to make us willing to dye.</p>
               <p>Is it not sad that God is forced to bring death upon all our comfortable and desireable things in this World, before he can gain our consents to be gone? Why will you put God upon such work as this? Why cannot he have your hearts at a cheaper rate? If you could dye, many of your comforts for ought I know might live. Had <hi>Iacob</hi> come to <hi>Absalom</hi> when he sent for him the first, or second time: <hi>Absalom</hi> had never set his field of Barly on fire, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.30.

               <p>Alas! To cut off your comforts one after another, and make you live a groaning life, the Lord hath no pleasure in it; but rather he had you should lose these things, than that
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:63760:181"/>
he should lose your hearts on Earth, or company in Heaven: <hi>Impatiens aegrotus crudelem facit Medicum.</hi>

               <p>LAstly, Let no Christian be affrighted at death, considering that the death of Christ, is the death of Death, and hath utterly disarmed it of all its destructive power.</p>
               <p>If you tremble when you look upon death, yet you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but triumph when you look believingly upon Christ.</p>
               <p>For (1) Christ died (O believer) for thy sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. his death was an expiatory Sacrifice for all thy guilt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. so that thou shalt not die in thy sins: the pangs of death may, and must be on thy outward man, but the guilt of sin, and the Condemnation of God shall not be upon thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The death of Christ in thy room hath utterly destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the power of death, which once was in the hand of <hi>Satan. Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14, 15. his power was not <hi>authoritative,</hi> but <hi>executive</hi>: Not as the power of a <hi>King</hi> but of a <hi>Sheriff</hi>; which is none at all when a Pardon is produced.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Christ hath assured us, that his Victory over death shall be compleat in our persons. It is already a compleat personal Victory, in respect of himself, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9. he dieth no more, death hath no more Dominion over him. It's an incompleat Victory already as to our persons. It can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Union of our Souls and Bodies, but the Union betwixt Christ and our Souls it can never dissolve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. and as for the power it still retains over our dust, that also shall be destroyed at the Resurrection, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.25, 26. comp. with verses 54, 55, 56, 57. so that there is no cause for any Soul in Christ to tremble at the thoughts of a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the body, but rather to embrace it as a priviledge, death is ours.</p>
               <p>O that these arguments might prevail! O that they might at last win the consent of our hearts to go along with death, which is the Messenger sent by God to bring us home to our Fathers house.</p>
               <p>But I doubt when all is said, we are where we were, all this suffices not to overcome the Regrets and Reluctancies of Nature; still the matter sticks in our minds, and we cannot conquer our disinclined Wills in this matter. What is the

(4) In the deep engagements of our hearts to earthly things: they could not be so cold to Christ, if they were not overheated with other things.

                  <hi>Augustine</hi> gives this reason for the frequent use of Metaphors and Allegories in Scripture, because they are so much proportioned to our senses, with which our senses have contracted an intimacy and familiarity: and therefore God to accommodate his truth to our capacity, doth as it were this way embody it in earthly expressions, according to that celebrated observation of the <hi>Cabalists, lumen supremum nunquam descendit sine indumento</hi>: The pure and supream light never descends to us without a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or covering.

So that <hi>Tophet</hi> was a meer <hi>Shambles,</hi> the publick chopping block on which the limbs both of young and old were quartered out by thousands; it was filled with dead Bodies, till there was no place for burial. By all which it appears that no spot of ground in the World was so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the fires kindled in it to destroy men, for the doleful cries that echo'd from it, or the innumerable multitudes that perished in it; for which reasons it is made the <hi>embleme</hi> of Hell.

                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20. denoting the most exquisite torment, by an intense and durable flame.</p>
               <p>And in the <hi>Text</hi> it's called a prison,<note place="margin">A prison.</note> where the Spirits of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men are both <hi>detained</hi> and <hi>punished.</hi> This notion of a Prison gives us a lively representation of the miserable state of damned Souls, and that especially in the following particulars.</p>
               <p>First, Prisoners are arrested and seized by authority of Law; 'tis the Law which sends them thither, and keeps them there. The <hi>Mittimus</hi> of a Justice is but the instrument of the Law whereby they are deprived of liberty, and taken into custody. The Law of God which sinners have both violated and despised, at death takes hold of them and arrests them. 'Tis the Law which claps up their Spirits in Prison, and in the name and authority of the great and terrible God commits them to Hell. All that are out of Christ are under the curse and damning sentence of the Law which now comes to be executed on them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Prisoners are carried or haled to prison by force and constraint. Natural force backs legal authority. The Law is executed by rough and resolute <hi>Bayliffs</hi> who compel them to go, though never so much against their will. This also is the case of the wicked at death. Satan is Gods <hi>Bayliff</hi> to hurry away the Law-condemned Soul to the infernal <hi>Prison.</hi> The Devil hath the power of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14 as the Executioner hath of the Body of a condemned man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Prisoners</hi> are chained and bolted in Prison to prevent their escape: so are damned Spirits secured by the power of God, and chained by their own guilty and trembling Consciences in Hell, unto the time of Judgment, and the fulness of misery; not that they have no torment in the mean time Alas! Were there no more but that fearful expectation of wrath and fiery indignation, spoken of by the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27. it were an inexpressible torment; but there is a further degree of torment
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:63760:186"/>
to be awarded them at the judgment of the great day, to which they are therefore kept as in Chains and Prisons.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Prisons are dark and noisome places not built for pleasure, as other houses are, but for punishment; so is Hell, Jud. v. 6. <hi>Reserved in everlasting chains under darkness,</hi> as he there describes the place of torments, yea utter darkness, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 12. extream or perfect darkness. <hi>Philosophers</hi> tell us of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this World, <hi>non dantur purae tenebrae,</hi> that there is no pure or perfect darkness here, without some mixture of light; but there is not a glade of light, not a spark of hope or comfort shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into that Prison.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Mournful sighs and groans are heard in Prisons, <hi>Psal.</hi> 97.11. Let the <hi>sighing of the Prisoners come before thee,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist.</hi> But deeper sighs and emphatical groans are heard in Hell, <hi>There shall be weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth,</hi> Matth. 8 12. Those that could not groan under the sence of sin on Earth, shall howl under anguish and desperation in Hell.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, There is a time when Prisoners are brought out of the Prison to be judged, and then return in a worse condition than before, to the place from whence they came. God also hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day for the solemn condemnation of those Spirits in Prison. The Scriptures call it the iudgement of the great day, <hi>Iude v.</hi> 6. from the great business that is to be done therein, and the great and solemn assembly that shall then appear before God.</p>
               <p>But I will insist no longer upon the display of the <hi>Metaphor.</hi> My business is to give you a representation of the state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of damned Souls in Hell, and to assist your conceptions of them and of their state.</p>
               <p>'Tis a dreadful sight I am to give you this day, but how much better is it to see, than to feel that wrath: the treasures thereof shall shortly be broken up, and poured forth upon the Spirits of men.</p>
               <p>You had in the former Discourse a faint umbrage of the Spirits of just men in glory; in this you will have an imperfect repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the Spirits of wicked men in Hell: and look as the former cannot be adequate and perfect, because that happiness passeth our knowledge; so neither can this be so, because the misery of the damned passeth our fear.</p>
               <p>The case and state of a damned Spirit will be best opened in these following Propositions.</p>

                  <head>PROP. I. That the guilt of all sin gathers to and settles in the Conscience of every Christless sinner, and makes up a vast treasure of guilt in the course of his life in this World.</head>
                  <p>THE high and awful power of Conscience belonging to the understanding faculty in the Soul of Man, was spoken to before, as to its general nature, <hi>Page</hi> 21. And that conscience certainly accompanies it, and is inseparable from it, was there shewed. I am <hi>here</hi> to consider it as the <hi>seat</hi> or <hi>centre</hi> of guilt in all unregenerate and lost Souls. For look as the tides wash up, and leave the slime and filth upon the <hi>shore,</hi> even so all the corruption and sin that is in the other faculties of the Soul settles, upon the conscience. <hi>Their mind and conscience</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is defiled. Tit.</hi> 1.15. it is as it were the <hi>sink</hi> of a sinners Soul into which all filth runs, and guilt settles.</p>
                  <p>The conscience of every Believer is purged from its filthiness by the blood of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. his blood and his Spirit purifie it and pacifie it, whereby it becomes the region of light and peace, but all the guilt which hath been long contracting through the life of an unbeliever, fixes it self deep and fast in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. <hi>It is written upon the Tables of their hearts as with a pen of Iron,</hi> Jer. 17.1. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> guilt is as a mark or character fashioned or ingraven in the very substance of the Soul, as letters are cut into glass with a Diamond.</p>
                  <p>Conscience is not only the principal <hi>engagée</hi> obliged unto God as a Judge, but the principal <hi>director</hi> and guide of the Soul in its courses and actions, and consequently the guilt of all sin falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it and rests in it. The Soul is both the spring and fountain of all actions that go outward from man, and the term or recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of all actions inward: but in both sorts of actions, going outward and coming inward, conscience is the chief <hi>Counsellor, Guide</hi> and <hi>director</hi> in all, and so the guilt which is contracted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, must be upon its head? 'Tis the bridle of the Soul to restrain it from sin, the eye of the Soul to direct its course; and therefore is principally chargeable with all the evils of life. Bodily members are but instruments, and the will it self, as high and noble a faculty or power as it is, moveth not, until the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cometh to a conclusion, and the debate be ended in the mind.</p>
                  <p>Now in the whole course and compass of a sinners life in this World, what treasures of guilt must needs be lodged in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63760:187"/>
What a <hi>Magazine</hi> of sin and filth must be laid up there! 'Tis said of a wicked man, Job 20.11. <hi>His bones are full of the sins of his youth</hi>: meaning his Spirit, Mind or Conscience is as full of sin as bones are of Marrow; yea, the very sins of his Youth are enough to fill them: and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. they are said <hi>to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure up wrath against the day of wrath,</hi> which is only done by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring up guilt; for wrath and guilt are treasured up together, in proportion to each other. Every day of his life vast summs have been cast into this treasury, and the patience of God waiteth till it be full, before he call the sinner to an account and reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>IF you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins,</hi> Joh. 8.24. and Job 20.11. <hi>His bones are full of the sins of his youth which shall lye down with him in the dust.</hi> No Proposition lies clearer in Scripture, or should lie with greater weight upon the hearts of sinners: nothing but pardon can remove guilt; but without faith and repentance there never was nor shall be a pardon, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 24, 25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.46, 47. Look as the graces of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, so the sins of Unbelievers follow the Soul whithersover it goes. All their sins who dye out of Christ cry to them when they go hence, <hi>We are thy works, and we will follow thee.</hi> The acts of sin are transient, but the guilt and effects of it are permanent; and it is evident by this, that in the great day their consciences which are the Books of record wherein all their sins are registred, will be opened, and they shall be judged by them, and out of them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12.</p>
                  <p>Now before that general judgment, every Soul comes to its particular judgment, and that immediately after death; of this I apprehend the <hi>Apostle</hi> to speak in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed for all men once to dye, but after that the judgment.</hi> The Soul is presently stated by this judgment in its everlasting and fixed condition. The Soul of a wicked man appearing before God in all its sin and guilt, and by him sentenced, immediately it gives up all its hope, Prov. 11.7. <hi>When a wicked man dyeth, his expectation shall perish,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                  <p>This perishing or cutting off of hope is that which is called in Scripture the death of the Soul, for so long the Soul will live as it hath any hope. The deferring of hope makes it sick, but the final cutting off of hope strikes it quite dead (<hi>i.e.</hi>) dead as to all joy, comfort, or expectation of any for ever, which is that death which an immortal Soul is capable to suffer: the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous hath hope in his death; but every unregenerate man in the world breaths out his last hope in a few moments after his last breath, which strikes terror into the very centre of the Soul, and is a death-wound to it.</p>

                  <head>PROP. III. The Souls of the damned are exceeding large and capacious subjects of wrath and torment; and in their separate state their capacity is greatly enlarged, both by laying asleep all those affections whose exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise is relieving: and throughly awakning all those passions which are tormenting.</head>
                  <p>THE Soul of man being by nature a Spirit, an intelligent Spirit, and in its substantial faculties assimilated to God whose image it bears: it must for that reason be exquisitely sensible of all the impressions and touches of the wrath of God upon it. The Spirit of man is a most tender, sensible and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive Creature. The eye of the Body is not so sensible of a touch, a nerve of the Body is not so sensible when pricked; as the Spirit of man is of the least touch of Gods indignation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. <hi>A wounded spirit who can bear?</hi> Prov. 18.14. Other external wounds upon the Body, inflicted either by man or God, are tolerable; but that which immediately toucheth the Spirit of man is insufferable. Who can bear or endure it?</p>
                  <p>And as the Spirit of man hath the most delicate and exquisite sense of misery; so it hath a vast capacity to receive, and let in the fulness of anguish and misery into it: it is a large vessel, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>a vessel of wrath fitted to destruction.</hi> The large capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Soul is seen in this, that it is not in the power of all the creatures in the World to satisfie and fill it. It can drink up (as one speaks) all the rivers of created good, and its thirst not quenched by such a draught; but after all, it crys, Give, give. Nothing but an infinite God can quiet and satisfie its appetite and raging thirst.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:63760:188"/>And as it is capable and receptive of more good than is found in all the Creatures; So it is capable of more misery and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish than all the Creatures can inflict upon it. Let all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or men on Earth, yea, all the Devils and damned in Hell conspire and unite in a design to torment man; yet when they have done all, his Spirit is capable of a farther degree of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a torment as much beyond it, as a rack is beyond an hard bed, or the Sword in his bowels is beyond the scratch of a pin. The Devils indeed are the executioners and tormentors of the damned; but if that were all they were capable to suffer, the torments of the damned would be comparatively mild and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to what they are. O the largeness of the understanding of man! What will it not take into its vast capacity?</p>
                  <p>But add to this, That damned Souls have all those affections laid in a deep and everlasting sleep, the exercises whereof would be relieving by emptying their Souls of any part of their misery: and all those passions throughly and everlastingly awakened which increase their torments.</p>
                  <p>The affections of joy, delight and hope are all benummed in them, and laid fast asleep, never to be awakened into act any more. Their hope in Scripture is said to <hi>perish: (i. e.)</hi> it so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth, that after death it shall never exert another act to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The activity of any of these affections would be like a cooling gale, or refreshing Spring amidst their torments; but as <hi>Adrian</hi> lamented himself, <hi>nunquam jocos dabis,</hi> thou shalt never be merry more.</p>
                  <p>And as these affections are laid asleep, so their passions are rouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and throughly awakened to torment them. So awakened, as never to sleep any more. The Souls of men are sometimes jog'd and startled in this World, by the words or rods of God, but presently they sleep again and forget all: but hereafter the eyes of their Souls will be continually held waking to behold and consider their misery; their understandings will be clear and most apprehensive; their thoughts fixed and determined; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences active and efficacious: and by all this their capacity to take in the fulness of their misery enlarged to the uttermost.</p>

                  <p>And as if anger and wrath were not words of a sufficient edge and sharpness, its called <hi>fiery indignation,</hi> and <hi>vengeance</hi>: words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting the most intense degree of divine wrath. For indeed his power is to be glorified in the destruction of his enemies, and therefore now he will do it to purpose. He takes them now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hands. No creature can come at the Soul immediately, that is Gods prerogative, and now he hath to do with it himself in fury and revenges poured out. Can thy hands be strong, or thy heart endure when I shall deal with thee? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, the spirit quails and dies under it. This is the Hell of Hells.</p>
                  <p>What doleful cries and laments have we heard from Gods dearest children, when but some few drops of his anger have been sprinkled upon their Souls here in this world!

                  <head>PROP. V The separate Spirit of a damned man becomes a tormentor to it self by the various and efficacious actings of its own conscience, which are a special part of its torment in the other World.</head>
                  <p>COnscience which should have been the sinners <hi>curb</hi> on <hi>earth,</hi> becomes the <hi>Whip</hi> that must lash his Soul in <hi>Hell.</hi> Neither is there any faculty or power belonging to the Soul of man so fit and able to do it as his own conscience. That which was the seat and centre of all guilt, now becomes the seat and centre of all torments. The suspension of its tormenting power in this World is a mystery and wonder to all that duely consider it. For certainly should the Lord let a sinners conscience flie upon him with rage in the midst of his sins and pleasures, it would put them into an Hell upon Earth, as we see in the doleful instances of <hi>Iudas, Spira, &amp;c.</hi> but he keeps an hand of restraint upon them generally in this life, and suffers them to sleep quietly by a grumbling or seared conscience, which couches by them as a sleepy <hi>Lion,</hi> and lets them alone.</p>
                  <p>But no sooner is the Christless Soul turn'd out of the Body, and cast for eternity at the bar of God, but conscience is rouzed, and put into a rage never to be appeased any more. It now racks and tortures the miserable Soul with its utmost efficacy and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. The mere presages and forebodeings of wrath by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of sinners in this World hath made them lye with a ghastly paleness in their faces, an universal trembling in all their Members, a cold sweating horrour upon their panting bosoms, like men already in Hell: but this, all this is but as the sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or giving of the stones before the great rain falls. The acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of conscience (especially in Hell) are various, vigorous, and dreadful to consider, such are its <hi>recognitions, accusations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations upbraidings, shameings,</hi> and <hi>fearful expectations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, the consciences of the damned will recognize, and bring back the sins committed in this World fresh to their mind: for what is conscience, but a Register, or book of Records wherein every sin is ranked in its proper place and order: this act of conscience is fundamental to all its other acts; for it cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, condemn, upbraid, or shame us, for that it hath lost out of its memory, and hath no sense of. <hi>Son, remember,</hi> said <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives</hi> in the midst of his torments. This remembrance of sins past, mercies past, opportunities past, but especially of hope past and gone with them, never to be recovered any more, is like that
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:63760:189"/>
fire not blown (of which <hi>Zophar</hi> speaks) which consumes him, or the glistering Sword coming out of his Gall, <hi>Iob</hi> 20.24, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It chargeth and accuseth the damned Soul, and its charges are home, positive, and self-evident charges: a thousand legal and unexceptionable Witnesses cannot confirm any point more than one Witness in a mans bosome can do, <hi>Rom</hi> 2.15. it convicts and stops their mouths, leaving them without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse or Apology. Just and righteous are the Judgments of God upon thee, saith Conscience: in all this Ocean of misery, there is not one drop of injury or wrong: the Judgment of God is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto truth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It <hi>condemns</hi> as well as chargeth and witnesseth, and that with a dreadful Sentence; backing and approving the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The upbraidings of Conscience in Hell are terrible and insufferable things: to be continually hit in the teeth and twitted with our madness, wilfulness, and obstinacy, as the cause of all that eternal misery which we have pull'd down upon our own heads, What is it but the rubbing of the wound with Salt and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar?

                  <p>Fifthly, The <hi>shameings</hi> of Conscience are unsufferable torments. Shame arises from the turpitude of discovered actions. If some mens secret filthiness were but published in this World, it would confound them; what then will it be, when all shall lie open, as it will after this life; and their own Consciences shall cast the shame of all upon them! They shall not only be derided by God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26. but by their own Consciences also.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, The fearful expectations of Conscience still looking forward into more and more wrath to come, this is the very summ and complement of their misery. What makes a Prison so dreadful to a Malefactor, but the trembling expectations he there lives under of the approaching Assizes? Much after the same rate, or rather after the rate of condemned persons preparing for Execution, do these Spirits in Prison live in the other World. But alas, no instance or similitude can reach home to their case.</p>

                  <head>PROP. VI. That which makes the torments and terrours of the damned Spirits so extream and terrible, is, that they are unrelievable miseries, and torments for ever.</head>
                  <p>They are not capable either of
<list>
                        <item>1. A partial relief by any mitigation, or,</item>
                        <item>2. A compleat relief by a final cessation.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not of a partial relief by any mitigation: could they but divert their thoughts from their misery, as they were wont to do in this World, drink and forget their sorrows; or had they but any hope of the abatement of their misery, it would be a relief to them: But both these are impossible. Their thoughts are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and determined: to remove them (though but for a moment) from their misery, is as impossible as to remove a Mountain: their sin and misery is ever before them. As the blessed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are <hi>bono confirmati,</hi> so fixed and setled in blessedness, that they are not diverted one moment from beholding the blessed face of God, for they are ever with the Lord: so the damned in Hell are <hi>malo obfirmati,</hi> so setled and fixed in the midst of all evil, that their thoughts and miseries are inseparable for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Much less can their undone state admit the least hope of relief by a final cessation of their misery. All hope perisheth from them, and the perishing of their hope, is the plainest proof that can be given of the eternity of their misery. For were there but the remotest possibility of deliverance at last, hope would hang upon that possibility: and whilst hope lives, the Soul is not quite dead, the death of hope is the death of a mans Spirit: the cutting off of the Soul from God, and the last act of hope to see or enjoy him for ever, is that death which an immortal Soul is capable of suffering. Depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire, is that Sentence which strikes hope and soul dead for ever. In these six Propositions you have the true and terrible Representation of the Spirits in Prison, or the state of damned Souls. I have not mentioned their association with Devils, or the dismal place of their confinement, which though they compleat their misery, yet are not the principal parts of it, but rather Accessories to it, or Rivers running into the Ocean of their misery. The summ of their misery lies in what was opened before, and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it is in that which followeth.</p>

                  <p>IS this the state of ungodly Souls after death? Then it follows, that <hi>neither death nor annihilation are the worst of evils, incident to man. Aristotle</hi> calls death the most terrible of all terribles: and the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> affirm Annihilation to be a greater evil than the most miserable being: but it is neither so, nor so; the Wrath of God, the Worm of Conscience, are much more bitter than death. The pains of death are natural and bodily pains; the Wrath of God and anguish of Conscience, are spiritual and inward: that is but the pain of a few hours or days, these are the unrelieved torments of eternity.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>Annihilation,</hi> what a favour would the damned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it! Indeed if we respect the glory of Gods justice which is exemplified and illustrated in the ruine of these miserable souls, it is better they should abide as the eternal monuments thereof, than not be at all; but with respect to themselves, we may say as Christ doth of the Son of Perdition, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.24. <hi>Good had it been for them if they had never been born</hi>: For a mans Soul to be of no other use than a vessel of wrath, to receive the indignation, and be filled with the fury of God; surely an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>timely Birth that was never animated with a reasonable Soul, is better than they: for alas, they seek for death, but it flies from them. The immortality of their Souls, which was their dignity and priviledge above other Creatures, is now their misery, and that which continually feeds and perpetuates their flame. Here is a Being without the comfort of it, a Being only to howl and tremble under Divine wrath: a Being therefore, which they would gladly exchange with the contemptiblest Fly, or most loathsome Toad, but it cannot be exchanged or annihilated.</p>

                  <p>HEnce it follows, <hi>That the pleasures of sin are dear bought and costly pleasures.</hi> There is a greater disproportion betwixt that pleasure, and this wrath; than betwixt a drop of Honey, and a Sea of <hi>Gall.</hi> Could a man distil all the imaginable pleasure of sin, and drink nothing else but the highest and most refined de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of it all his life, though his life should be protracted to the Term of <hi>Methuselahs</hi>: Yet one day or night under the wrath of God would make it a dear bargain. But</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis certain sin hath no such Pleasures to give you: they are all imbitter'd either by adverse stroaks of Providence from without, or painful and deadly gripes and twinges of Conscience within, <hi>Iob</hi> 20.14. <hi>His meat in his Bowels is turned, it is the gall of Aspes within him.</hi>

'Tis as certain, the time of a sinner is near its Period when he is at the height of his pleasure in sin: for look, as high delights in God speak the Maturity of a Soul for Heaven, and it will not be long before such be in Heaven, so the heights of delight in sin, answerably speak the Maturity of such a Soul for Hell; and it will not be long ere it be there. Sin is now a big <hi>Embryo,</hi> and speedily the Soul travels with death.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 According to the measure of delights men have had in sin, will be the degrees and measures of their torment in Hell, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7. so much torment and sorrow, as there was delight and pleasure in sin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To conclude, the pleasures of sin are but for a season, as you read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. but the wrath of God in Hell is for ever, and ever. There is a time, when the pleasures of sin cannot be called <hi>pleasure to come,</hi> but the Wrath of God that will still be wrath to come. O consider for what a trifle you sell your Souls! When <hi>Lysimachus</hi> parted with his Kingdom for a draught of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he said when he had drank it, <hi>For how short a pleasure have I sold a Kingdom!</hi> And <hi>Ionathan</hi> lamented, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.43. <hi>I tasted but a little Honey, and I must die.

                     <hi>WHat a matchless madness is it to cast the Soul into Gods Prison, to save the Body out of Mans Prison!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men have their Prisons, and God hath his: but because the one is an Object of Sense, and the other an Object of Faith; that only is feared, and this slighted all over this unbelieving World; except by a very small number of men who tremble at the Word of God. Now, this I say is the height of madness, and will appear to be so in a just Collation of both in a few Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. (1) Mans Prison restrains the Body only, Gods Prison Soul and Body, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.28. The Spirits of Men (as my Text speaks) are the Prisoners there. O what a vast odds doth this single difference make? A thousand times more than the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating and binding of the greatest <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Emperour</hi> differs from the imprisonment of a poor Mechanick, or Vagrant Beggar. (2) In Mans Prison there are many comforts and unspeakable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshments from Heaven, but in Gods Prison none, but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary. You read of the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.25. how they sang in the Prison: the Spirit of God made them a Banquet of heavenly Ioys, and they could not but sing at it: though their
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:63760:191"/>
feet were in the stocks, their Spirits were never more at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. <hi>Algerius</hi> dated his Letters from the delectable <hi>Orchard</hi> of the <hi>Leonine</hi> Prison: where saith he, flows the sweetest Nectar. Another tells us Christ was always kind to him, but since he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Prisoner for him, he even overcame himself in kindness. I verily think, saith he, the Chains of my Lord are all overlaid with pure Gold, and his Cross perfumed: but the worst terrours of the Prisoners in Hell, come from the presence of the Lord, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God is a terrour to them.</hi> (3) The cause for which a man is cast into Prison by men, may be his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty, and so his Conscience must be at least quiet, if not joyful in such Sufferings. So it was with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 28.20. <hi>For the hope of Israel am I bound with this Chain</hi>: This diffuses Joy and Peace through the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science into the whole man; but the cause for which men are cast into Gods Prison, is their sin and guilt, which armes their own Consciences against them, and makes them as you heard before, Self-tormentors, terrours to themselves. What odds is here? (4) In Mans Prison, the most excellent Company and sweet Society may be found. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were fellow Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. In <hi>Queen Maries</hi> days, the most excellent Company to be found in <hi>England,</hi> was in the Prisons: Prisons were turned into Churches. But in Gods Prison no better Society is to be found, than that of Devils, and damned Reprobates, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. (5) In Mans Prison there is hope of a comfortable deliverance; but in Gods Prison none, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Thou shalt not come out thence, till thou hast paid the last Mite.</hi> 'Tis an everlasting Prison.</p>
                  <p>Compare these few obvious Particulars, and judge then what is to be thought of that man, who stands readier to cast himself into any guilt, than into the least Suffering? What is it but as if a man should offer his Neck to the Sword, to save his hand? The Lord convince us what trifles our Estates, Liberties, and Lives are to our Souls, or to the peace and purity of our Consciences.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>free pardon</hi> to thy Soul; though it cost Christ dear, it costs thee nothing. We have redemption, even <hi>the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace,</hi> Eph. 1.7. The <hi>project</hi> of it was Gods, not thine; the price for it was Christs blood, not thine: the glory and riches of free grace are illustriously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in thy forgiveness.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

The blood of Christ cleanseth us from all sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It must be as <hi>firm,</hi> as it is free and full, even an irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pardon for ever more.

The justified shall never come again under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. O the unspeakable joy that flows from this Spring! O the triumphs of faith upon this foundation!</p>
                  <p>It is not ravishing, melting, overwhelming, and amazing, to think thus with thy self? Here sit I with a joyful plenary free pardon of sin in my hand, whilst many who never sinned to that height and degree I have, lye groaning, howling, sweating, and trembling under the indignation of God poured out like fire upon their Souls in Hell.

dreadful Tempest! This poor breast of mine was lately pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sweating, trembling under the horrors of wrath to come, terrified with the visions of Hell.

                  <p>Here is the law, the wrath of God, and everlasting burnings; the just demerit of sin upon one side; and a poor sinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the other side: but the Covenant of grace hath solv'd all. An <hi>Act of oblivion</hi> is past in Heaven, <hi>I will forgive their iniquities, and their sins and transgressions will I remember no more.</hi> In this Act of Grace my Soul is included; I am in Christ, and there is no condemnation. Dye I must, but damned I shall not be: My debts are paid, my bonds are cancelled, my Conscience is qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted; let death do its worst, it shall do me no harm, that blood which satisfies God, may well satisfie me.</p>

                     <hi>HOw amazingly sad and deplorable is the security and stilness of the Consciences of sinners under all their own guilts, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate danger of Gods everlasting wrath!</hi>

                     <hi>Philosophers</hi> observe that before an Earthquake the Wind lies, and the weather is exceeding calm and still, not a breath of wind going. So it is in the Consciences of many just before the tempest and storm of Gods wrath pours down upon them. What a golden morning open'd upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> and began that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal day? Little did they imagine showres of fire had been ready to fall from so pleasant and serene a skie as they saw over their heads. How secure, still, and unconcerned are those to day, who it may be shall rage, roar, and tremble in Hell to morrow? <hi>Caesar</hi> hearing of a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> who was deep in debt, and yet slept soundly, would needs have his Pillow, as supposing there was some strange charming virtue in it.</p>
                  <p>It is wonderful to consider what shift men make to keep their consciences in that stilness and quiet they do, under such loads of guilt, and threatnings of wrath ready to be executed upon them. It must be some strong <hi>Opium</hi> that so stupefies and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nums their Consciences; and upon enquiry into the matter we shall find it to be the effect of

                  <p n="1">1. This stilness of Conscience upon the brink of damnation proceeds from the strong delusions of Satan; blinding their eyes and feeding their false hopes; he removes the evil day at many years imaginary distance from them, and interposeth many a fair day betwixt them and it, and in that interposed season, time enough to prepare for it; without such an artifice as this, his house would be in an uproar, but this keeps all in peace, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21.<note place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. This stilness of Conscience in so miserable and dangerous a state, is the effect of a spiritual, judicial stroke of God upon the children of wrath. That's a dreadful word, Isaiah 6.10. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes</hi>:<note place="margin">

                     <hi>THe case of distressed Consciences upon earth, is exceeding sad, and calls upon all for the tenderest pity, and utermost help from men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You see the labourings of Conscience under the sense of guilt and wrath, is a special part of the Torments of Hell; of which there is not a livelier Emblem or Picture, than the distresses of Conscience in this World.</p>
                  <p>It must be thankfully confessed there are two great differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt the terrours of Conscience here, and there: One in the <hi>degrees</hi> of anguish, the other in the <hi>reliefs</hi> of that anguish. The ordinary distresses of Conscience here, compared with those of the damned, are as the flame of a Candle, to a fiery Oven; a mild and gentle fire: Or as the Sparks that fly out of the top of a Chimney, to the dreadful eruptions of <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> or Mount <hi>Aetna.</hi> Beside, these are capable of relief, but those are unrelievable: their hearts die, because their hope is perished from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>But yet of all the miseries and distresses incident to men in this World, none like those of distressed Consciences: the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:63760:193"/>
of God set themselves in array, or are drawn up in <hi>Batalia</hi> against the Soul, <hi>Iob</hi> 6.4, <hi>Whilst I suffer thy terrors</hi> (saith <hi>Heman</hi>) <hi>I am distracted,</hi> Psal. 88.15. Yea, they not only distract, but cut off the Spirit; as he adds <hi>v.</hi> 16. They lick up the very Spirit of a man, and none can bear them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. for now a man hath to do immediately with God; yea, with the Wrath of the great and dreadful God; and this wrath which is the most acute and sharp of all torments, falls upon the most tender and sensible part, the Spirit and Mind which now lies open and naked before him to be wounded by it. No Creature can administer the least relief, by the application of any temporal comfort or refreshment to it. Gold and Silver, Wife and Children, Meat and Melody, signifie no more than the drawing off a silk stockin to cure the <hi>Paroxysms</hi> of the <hi>Gout.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that can be done for their relief is by seasonable, judicious, and tender Applications of Spiritual Remedies, and what can be done ought to be done for them. What heart can hear a voice like that of <hi>Iob, Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my Friends, for the Hand of God hath touched me</hi>; and not melt into Compassions over them? Is there a word of Wisdom in thy heart, let thy Tongue apply it to the relief of thy distressed Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: whilst his heart meditates <hi>terrour,</hi> let thine meditate his <hi>succour.</hi> It is not impossible but thou who lendest a friendly hand to another, maist ere long need one thy self, and he that hath ever felt the terrours of the Almighty upon his Soul, hath motive enough to draw forth the Bowels of his pity to another in the like case.</p>
                  <p>Alas for poor distressed Souls, who have either none about them that understand and are able and willing to speak a word in season to their weary Souls, or too many about them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate their sorrows, and persecute them whom God hath smitten. You that have both ability and opportunity for it are under the strongest engagements in the World to endeavour their relief with all faithfulness, seriousness, compassion, and constancy. Did Christ shed his Blood for the saving of Souls, and wilt not thou spend thy breath for them? Shall any man that hath found mercy from God, shew none to his Brother? God forbid. A Soul in Hell is out of your reach, but these that are in the Suburbs of Hell are not: the Candle of intense sorrow is put to the thread of their miserable life, and should they be suffered to drop into Hell whilst you stand by as unconcern'd: Spectators of such a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> will have little peace. Your unmercifulness to their Souls, will be a wound to your own.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>If Hell be out of measure dreadful, then sin must be out of measure sinful: the torments of Hell do not exceed the demerit of sin, though they exceed the understandings of men to conceive them. God will lay upon no man more than is right: sin is the Founder of Hell: all the miseries and torments there, are but the Treasures of wrath which sinners in all Ages have been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring up, and how dreadful soever it be, it is but the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>We have slight thoughts of sin, <hi>Fools make a mock of sin</hi>: but if the Lord by the convictions of mens Consciences did but lead them through the Chambers of death, and give them a sight of the wrath to come; could we but see the <hi>Piles</hi> that are made in Hell (as the Prophet calls them, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 30.33. to maintain the flames of Vengeance to eternity; could we but understand in what <hi>Dialect</hi> the damned speak of sin, who see the treasures of wrath broken up to avenge it, surely it would alter our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of sin, and strike cold to the very hearts of sinners.</p>
                  <p>Cannot the extremity and eternity of Hell Torments exceed the evil that is in sin? What words then can express the evil of it! Hell flames have the Nature of a <hi>punishment,</hi> but not of an <hi>atonement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O think on this you that look upon sin as the veriest trifle, that will sin for the value of a Penny: that look upon all the humiliations, broken hearted confessions, and bitter moans of the Saints under sin, as Frenzy, or Melancholy, slighting them as a Company of half-witted Hypochondriack persons. You that never had one sick night or sad day in all your lives upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of sin; let me tell thee, that breast of thine must be the seat of sorrow: that frothy airy Spirit of thine must be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with emphatical sobs and groans. God grant it may be on this side Hell by effectual repentance, else it must be there in the extremity and eternity of sorrows.</p>

Whose Conversation is so much in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that nothing falls out in the course thereof which may not farther some or other in their way to Hell?</p>
                  <p>Among wicked men there are five sorts eminently accessary to the guilt and ruine of other mens Souls. (1) Loose Professors, whose lives give their lips the Lie: whose Conversations make their Professions blush.

                  <p>And many there are who suffer sin to lie upon others, without a wise and seasonable reproof to recover them.</p>
                  <p>O what cruelty to Souls is here! The day is coming when they will curse the time that ever they knew you: 'tis possible you may repent, but then it may be those, whose Souls you have help'd to ruine, are gone, and quite out of your reach.

There be five Considerations provoking pity to them that are thus past into a miserable eternity, and Caution to all that are following after in the same path.</p>

                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:63760:195"/>First, That fatal mistake in the practical understanding and judgment of man deserves a compassionate lamentation, as the cause and reason of their eternal miscarriage and ruine. They looked upon trifles as things of greatest necessity, and the most necessary things as meer trifles: putting the greatest weight and value upon that which little concerned them, and none at all upon their greatest concernment in the whole World, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The perpetual diversions that the trifles of this World gave them from the main use and end of their time. O what a hurry and thick succession of earthly business and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances filled up their days! So that they could find no time to go alone, and think of the awful and weighty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the World to come, <hi>Iames</hi> 5.5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The total waste and expence of the only season of Salvation about these vanished, impertinent trifles, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more to be recovered, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9 10.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That these deluding shadows, the pleasures of a moment, is all they had in exchange for their Souls: a goodly price it was valued at, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That by such a life they have not only ruined their own Souls, but put their posterity, by their education of them in the same course of life, into the same path of destruction, in which they went to Hell before them: <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.13. <hi>Their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity approve their saying.</hi>

                  <p>That which men now call Pride, Humour, Fancy, and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness; will one day appear to be their great wisdom and the excellency of their Spirits.

                  <p>Your chastisements when sanctified are preventive of all the misery opened before.

                     <hi>HOw doleful a change doth the death of wicked men make upon them! from Palaces on Earth, to the Prison of Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No sooner is the Soul of a wicked man stept out of his own door at death, but the <hi>Serjeants</hi> of Hell are immediatly upon it, serving the dreadful summons on the Law-condemned wretch. This arrest terrifies it more than the hand-writing upon the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Wall did him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.5. How are all a mans apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions changed in a moment! Out of what a deep sleep are most, and out of what a pleasant dream of Heaven are some awaked and startled at death, by the dreadful arrest and summons of God to condemnation!</p>
                  <p>How quickly would all a sinners mirth be dampt and turned into houlings in this World, if Conscience were but throughly awakened! It is but for God to change our apprehensions now, and it would be done in a moment: but the eyes of most mens Souls are not opened, till death hath shut their bodily eyes; and then how suddain, and how sad a change is made in one day!</p>
                  <p>O think what it is to pass from all the pleasures and delights of this World into the torments and miseries of that World: from a pleasant Habitation, into an infernal Prison: from the depth of security to the extremity of desperation: from the arms and bosoms of dearest Friends and Relations, to the Society of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Spirits! Lord, what a change is here! Had a gracious change been made upon their hearts by grace, no such doleful change could have been made upon their state by death: Little do their surviving Friends think what they feel, or what is their estate in the other World, whilst they are honouring their Bodies with splendid and pompous Funerals. None on earth have so much

                  </p>
                  <p>This Prison which is continually filling with the Spirits of wicked men, is an undeniable evidence of it: for why is Hell called a Prison, and why are the Spirits of men confined and chained there; but with respect to the judgment of the great day? As there is a necessary connection betwixt sin and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so betwixt punishing and trying the Offender: there are millions of Souls in custody, a world of Spirits in Prison, these must be brought forth to their Tryal, for God will lay upon no man more than is right: the legality of their <hi>Mittimus</hi> to Hell, will be evidenced in their solemn day of Tryal. God hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>appointed a day in which he will judge the World in righteousness, by that Man whom he hath ordained,</hi> Acts 17.31.</p>
                  <p>Here sinners run in Arrears, and contract vast debts; in Hell they are seiz'd and committed, at Judgment tryed and cast for the same. This will be a dreadful day, those that have spent so prodigally upon the patience of God, must now come to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere account for all: they have past their particular judgment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after death, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.27. by this they know how they shall speed in the general judgment, and how it shall be with them for ever; but though this private Judgment secures their Damnation sufficiently, yet it clears not the Justice of God before Angels and Men sufficiently; and therefore they must appear once more before his Bar, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. In the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expectation of this day, those trembling Spirits now lie in Prison, and that fearful expectation is a principal part of their present misery and torment. You that refuse to come to the Throne of Grace, see if you can refuse to make your appearance at the Bar of Justice. You that brav'd and brow-beat your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters that warn'd you of it, see if you can out-brave your Judge too as you did them.

                  <p>The great <hi>Apostle</hi> of the Gentiles, found the consideration of the terror of the Lord, as a spur urging and enforcing him to ministerial faithfulness and diligence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we perswade men:</hi> and the same he presseth upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.1, 2. <hi>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall judge the quick, and the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdom: Preach the Word, be instant in season, and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering, and Doctrine.</hi> O that those to whom so great a trust as the Souls of men is committed, would labour to acquit themselves with all faithfulness therein as <hi>Paul</hi> did, warning every one night and day with tears, that if we cannot prevent their ruine which is most desireable; yet at least, we may be able to take God to Witness, as he did, that we are pure from the blood of all men.</p>
                  <p>O consider my Brethren, if your faithful plainness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied diligence to save mens Souls, produce no other fruit but their hatred of you now, yet it is much easier for you to bear that, than that they and you too should bear the Wrath of God for ever.</p>
                  <p>We have all of us personal guilt enough upon us, let us not add other mens guilt to our account: to be guilty of the blood of the meanest man upon the earth, is a sin which will cry in your Consciences; but to be guilty of the blood of Souls, Lord, who can bear it! Christ thought them worth his heart blood, and are they not worth the expence of our breath? Did he sweat blood to save them, and will not we move our lips to save them. 'Tis certainly a sore Judgment to the Souls of men, when such Ministers are set over them, as never understood the value of their peoples Souls; or were never heartily concerned about the Salvation of their own Souls.</p>

the just consultation and deliberation of all the Persons in the Godhead about it, that our hearts might be raised to the expectation of some extraordinary work to follow. great Counsels and wise Debates being both the forerunners and foundations of great Actions and Events to ensue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Iob</hi> 35.10. <hi>None saith, Where is God my makers?</hi> and <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 149 2. <hi>Let Israel rejoyce in his makers:</hi> In both places the word is plural.

                  </gap>rsons, no Angels are called to this Council-table, the whole matter was to be conducted by the Wisdom, and effected by the Power of God; and therefore there was no need to consult with any but himself, the wisdom of Angels being from him: but this great Council shews what an excellent Creature was now to be produced, and the excellency of that creature Man, was principally in his Soul; for the bodies of other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were made by the word of his command, are as beautiful, elegant, and neat as the body of man; yea, and in some respects more excellent. The Soul then was that rare piece which God in so condescending an expression tells us was created with the deliberation of a Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And by the way, this may smartly check the pride and arrogance of Souls, who dare take it upon them to teach God, as we interpretatively do in our censures of his works, and murmures at his disposals of us. Shall that Soul, which is the product of his Wisdom and Counsel, dare to instruct or counsel its Maker? but that by the bye. You see there is a transcendent dignity and worth in the Soul of man above all other Beings in the World, by the peculiar way of its production into the number of created Beings: no wise man deliberates long, or calls a counsel about ordinary matters, much less the All-wise God.</p>

Secondly, The Soul hath in it self an intrinsick worth and excellency worthy of that Divine Original whence it sprang: view it in its noble faculties and admirable powers, and it will appear to be a Creature upon which God hath laid out the riches of his Wisdom and Power.</p>

               <p>View its <hi>Will,</hi> and you shall find it like a <hi>Queen</hi> upon the Throne of the Soul, swaying the Scepter of Liberty in her hand,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Culverwell.</hi>
                  </note> (as one expresseth it) with all the affections waiting and attending upon her. No Tyrant can force it, no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can wrest the golden Scepter of Liberty out of its hand, the keys of all the Chambers of the Soul hang at its girdle, these it delivers to Christ in the day of his power; victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Grace sweetly determines it by gaining its consent, but commits no rape upon it by unnatural coaction. God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts its offering, though full of imperfections; but no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is accepted without it, how excellent soever the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it.</p>
               <p>View the <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Thoughts</hi> with their self-reflexive abilities, wherein the Soul retires into it self, and sits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from all eyes but his that made it, judging its own actions, and censuring its estate; viewing its face in its own glass, and correcting the indecencies it discovers there: Things of greatest moment and importance are silent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transacted in this Council-chamber betwixt the Soul and God; so remote from the knowledge of all Creatures, that neither Angels,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.11.</note> Devils, or men can know what it is doing there, but by uncertain guess, or revelation from God: here it impleads,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.15.</note> condemns, and acquits it self as at a privy Session, with respect to the Judgment of the great Day: here it meets with the best of comforts,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.12.</note> and with the worst of terrors.</p>
               <p>Take a survey of its Passions and Affections, and you will find them admirable: see how they are placed by Divine Wisdom in the Soul, some for defence and safety, others
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:63760:200"/>
for delight and pleasure. <hi>Anger</hi> actuates the Spirits, and rouzeth its courage, enabling it to break through difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: <hi>Fear</hi> keeps <hi>Sentinel,</hi> watching upon all dangers that approach us: <hi>Hope</hi> forestals the good, and anticipates the joys of the next Life, and thereby supports and strengthens the Soul under all the discouragements and pressures of the present life: <hi>Love</hi> unites it to the chiefest Good; he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him: <hi>Zeal</hi> is the Dagger which love draws in Gods cause and quarrel, to secure it self from sin, and testifie its resentments of Gods dishonour.</p>
               <p>O what a Divine spark is the Soul of man! well might Christ prefer it in dignity to the whole World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The worth of a Soul may be gathered and discerned from its subjective capacity and hability both of Grace and Glory. It is capable of all the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, of being silled with the fulness of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. to live to God here, and with God for ever. What excellent Graces do adorn some Souls! How are all the rooms richly hanged with Divine and costly Hangings, that God may dwell in them! This makes it like the carved works of the Temple, overlaid with pure Gold; here is Glory upon Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a new Creation upon the old; in the inmost parts of some Souls is a spiritual Altar erected with this Inscription, <hi>Holiness to the Lord:</hi> Here the Soul offers up it self to God in the sacred flames of Love, and here they sacrifice their vile affections, devoting them to destruction to the glory of their God: here God walks with delight, even a delight beyond what he takes in all the stately Structures and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent adorned Temples in the whole World, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.1, 2.</p>
               <p>No other Soul besides mans is marriageable to Christ, or capable of Espousals to the King of Glory: they were not designed, and therefore not endued with a capacity for such an honour as this; but such a capacity hath every Soul, even the meanest on Earth, and such honour have all his Saints: others may,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.2. Eph. 5.27.</note> but they are betrothed to Christ in this World, and shall be presented without spot before him in the World to come.</p>
               <p>It is now a lovely and excellent Creature in its naked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:63760:201"/>
state, much more beautiful and excellent in its sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gracious state; but what shall we say, or how shall we conceive of it, when all spots of sin are perfectly washed off its beautiful face in Heaven, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon it! When its filthy garments are taken away, and the pure robes of perfect Holiness, as well as Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, superinduced upon this excellent Creature! If the imperfect beauty of it, begun in Sanctification, enamou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, The preparations God makes for Souls in Heaven, speak their great worth and value. When you lift up your eyes to Heaven, and behold that bespangled Azure Canopy, beset and inlaid with so many golden Studs, and sparkling Gems, you see but the floor or pavement of that place which God hath prepared for some Souls. He furnished this World for us before he put us into it; but as delightful and beautiful as it is, it is no more to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Fathers house in Heaven, than the smallest rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Chapel</hi> your eyes ever beheld, is to be compared with <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple when it stood in all its shining glory.</p>
               <p>When you see a stately magnificent Structure built, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Hangings and Furniture prepared to adorn it, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude some great persons are to come thither; such prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions speak the quality of the <hi>Guests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Heaven, yea the Heaven of Heavens, the Palace of the great King, the Presence-chamber of the Godhead is prepared, not only by Gods Decree and Christs Death, but by his Ascension thither in our Names, and as our Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for all renewed and redeemed Souls: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.2. <hi>In my Fathers house are many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you; I go to prepare a place for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And where is the place prepared for them? but in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house; the same place, the very same house where the Father, Son and Spirit themselves do dwell: such is the love
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:63760:201"/>
of Christ to Souls, that he will not dwell in one house, and they in another; but as he speaks, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.26. <hi>Where I am, there shall my servant also be.</hi> There is room enough in the Fathers house for Christ and all the Souls he redeemed to live and dwell together for evermore. His Ascension thither was in the capacity of a common or publick person, to take Livery and Seisin of those many mansions for them, which are to be filled with their inhabitants, as they come thither in their respective times and orders.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, The great price with which they were redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and purchased, speaks their dignity and value. No wise man will purchase a trifle at a great price, much less the most wise God. Now the redemption of every Soul stood in on less than the most precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>You know</hi> (saith the Apostle there) <hi>that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold— But with the precious blood of Christ, as a Lamb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemish and without spot.</hi> All the gold and silver in the world was no Ransom for one Soul; nay, all the blood of the Creatures, had it been shed as a Sacrifice to the glory of Justice, or even the blood which is most dear to us, as being derived from our own, I mean the blood of our dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, even of our first-born, the beginning of our strength, which usually have the strength of affection: I say, none of this could purchase a pardon for the smallest sin that ever any Soul committed, much less was it able to purchase the Soul it self, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.6, 7. Thousands of rams, and ten thousand rivers of oyl, or our first-born are no ransom to God for the sin of the Soul. It is only the precious Blood of Christ that is a just ransom or counterprice, as it's called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28.</p>
               <p>Now who can compute the value of that Blood? such was the worth of the Blood of Christ, which by the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of properties, is truly stiled the Blood of God; that one drop of it is above the estimations of men and Angels; and yet before the Soul of the meanest man or woman in the World could be redeemed, every drop of his Blood must be shed; for no less than his Death could be a price for our Souls. Hence then we evidently discern an invaluable worth
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:63760:202"/>
in Souls. A whole Kingdom is taxed when a King is to be ransomed, the delight and darling of Gods Soul must dye, when our Souls are to be redeemed. O the worth of Souls!</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixthly, This evidences the transcendent dignity and worth of Souls, that <hi>Eternity is stampt upon their actions,</hi> and theirs only of all the Beings in this World: the acts of Souls are immortal, as their Nature is, whereas the actions of other Animals having neither moral goodness or moral evil in them, pass away as their Beings do.</p>
               <p>The Apostle therefore in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7. compares the actions of men in this world to seed sown, and tells us of everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruits we shall reap from them in the next life: they have the same respect to a future account that seed hath to the Harvest; he that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> everlasting disappointment and misery, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.8. and they that now sow in tears, shall then reap in joy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 126.5. every gracious action is the seed of joy, and every sinful action the seed of sorrow; and this makes the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the actions of a rational Soul, and those done by Beasts: and if it were not so, man would then be wholly sway'd by sense and present things, as the beasts are, and all Religion would vanish with this distinction of actions.</p>
               <p>Our actions are considerable two ways, <hi>physically</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>; in the first sense they are <hi>transient,</hi> in the last <hi>perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent:</hi> a word is past assoon as spoken, but yet it must and will be recalled and brought into the Judgment of the great Day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36. whatever therefore a man shall speak, think, or do, once spoken, thought, or done, it becomes eternal, and abides for ever. Now, what is it that puts so great a difference betwixt humane and brutal actions, but the excellent Nature of the reasonable Soul? 'Tis this which stamps immortality upon humane actions, and is at once a clear proof both of the immortality and dignity of the Soul of man, above all other Creatures in this World.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seventhly, The contention of both Worlds, the strife of Heaven and Hell about the Soul of man, speaks it a most precious and invaluable Treasure.</p>
               <p>The Soul of man is the Prize about which Heaven and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:63760:202"/>
Hell contend: the great design of Heaven is to save it, and all the plots of Hell to ruine it. Man is a Borderer betwixt both Kingdoms, he lives here upon the Confines of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and material World; and therefore <hi>Scaliger</hi> fitly calls him, <hi>Vtrius<expan>

                  </gap>allies from Heaven to rescue and save it, such incursions from Hell to captivate and ruine it.</p>
               <p>The infinite Wisdom of God hath laid the plot and design for its Salvation by Christ in so great depth of counsel, that the Angels of Heaven are astonished at it, and desire to pry into it. Christ in pursuance of this eternal project came from Heaven professedly to seek and to save lost Souls, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.10. He compares himself to a good Shepherd who lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ninety nine to seek one lost sheep, and having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hell imploys all its skill and policy, sets a-work all wiles and stratagems to destroy and ruine it: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary the Devil goeth about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</hi> The strong man armed gets the first possession of the Soul, and with all his forces and policies labours to secure it as his property, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. Christ raises all the spiritual Militia, the very <hi>posse Coeli,</hi> the Powers of Heaven to rescue it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. And do Heaven and Earth thus contend, think you, <hi>de lana caprina,</hi> for a thing of nought? No, no, if there were not some singular and peculiar excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and worth in mans Soul, both worlds would never tug and pull at this rate, which should win that Prize: It was a great Argument of the worth and excellency of <hi>Homer,</hi> that incomparable <hi>Poet,</hi> that seven Cities contended for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Nativity:

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:63760:203"/>
themselves with the honour of his birth: but when Heaven and Hell shall contend about a Soul, certainly it much more speaks the dignity of it, than the contention of seven Cities for one <hi>Homer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What are all the wooings, expostulations, and passionate beseechings of Christs Ministers, what are all the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Conscience, and strong impressions made upon the affections; what are all strokes from Heaven upon men in the way of sin: I say, what are all these but the tuggings of Heaven to draw Souls out of the snares of Hell?</p>
               <p>And what are the hellish temptations that men feel in their hearts, the alluring objects presented to their eyes, the ensnaring examples that are set round about them; but the tuggings of Satan, if possible, to draw the Souls of men into the same condemnation and misery with himself?</p>
               <p>Would Heaven and Hell be up in Arms, as it were, and strive at this rate for nothing? Thy Soul, O man, how vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soever thou depreciatest and slightest it, is of high esteem, a rich purchace, a Creature of nobler rank than thou art aware of. The wise Merchant knows the value of Gold and Diamonds, though ignorant <hi>Indians</hi> would part with them for Glass-beads and Tinsel toyes. And this leads us to</p>
               <p n="8">8. The eighth Evidence of the invaluable worth of Souls, which is the joy in Heaven, and the rage in Hell for the gain and loss of the Soul of man.</p>
               <p>Christ who came from Heaven, and well knew the frame and disposition of the Inhabitants of that City,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quoties bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus gaudent Angeli, &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantur Daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; quoties à bono deviamus Diabolum laeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficamus, &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos suo gaudio defraudamus.</hi> August.</note> tells us, That <hi>there is joy in the presence of the Angels of God over one sinner that repenteth,</hi> Luke 15.7, 10. No sooner is the heart of a sinner darted with conviction, broken with sorrow for sin, and begins to cry, Men and brethren, what shall I do? but the news is quickly in Heaven, and sets all the City of God a rejoycing at it, as is in the chief City of a Kingdom when a young Prince is born.</p>
               <p>We never read that Christ laughed in all his time on Earth; but we read, that he once rejoyced in Spirit, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.21. And what was the occasion of that his joy, but the success of the Gospel in the Salvation of the Souls of men? Now certainly it must be some great good that so affects
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:63760:203"/>
Christ and all his Angels in Heaven at the sight of it: the degree of a wise mans joy is according to the value of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof: no man that is wise will rejoyce, feel his heart leap within him for gladness at a small or common thing.</p>
               <p>And as there is joy in Heaven for the saving, so certainly there is grief and rage in Hell for the loss of a Soul. No sooner had God by <hi>Pauls</hi> Ministry converted one poor <hi>Lydia</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> whither he was called by an immediate Express from Heaven for that service, but the Devil put all the City into an uproar, as if an Enemy had landed on their Coast, and raised a violent Persecution, which quickly drave him thence, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.9, 14, 22.</p>
               <p>And indeed what are all the fierce and cruel persecutions of Gods faithful Ministers, but so many efforts of the rage and malice of Hell against them, for plucking Souls as so many captives and preys out of his paws? For this he owes them a spight, and will be sure to pay them, if ever he get them at an advantage. But all this joy and grief demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates the high and great value of the Prize which is won by Heaven, and lost by Hell.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Ninthly, The institution of Gospel-Ordinances and the appointment of so many Gospel-Officers purposely for the saving of Souls, is no small evidence of what value and esteem they are.</p>
               <p>No man would light and maintain a Lamp fed with golden Oyl, and keep it burning from Age to Age, if the work to be done by the light of it were not of a very precious and important nature; what else are the Dispensations of the Gospel, but Lamps burning with golden Oyl to light Souls to Heaven, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.2, 3, 4, &amp; 12. compared: a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Vision is there presented to the Prophet, <hi>viz.</hi> a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick of Gold with a <hi>Bowl</hi> or <hi>Cistern</hi> upon the top of it, and seven Shafts with seven Lamps at the ends thereof, all lighted: and that these Lamps might have a constant sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of oyl, without any accessary humane help, there are presented (as growing by the Candlestick) two fresh and green Olive-trees on each side thereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. which do empty out of themselves golden Oyl, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. naturally dropping and distilling it into that Bowl, and the two Pipes
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:63760:204"/>
thereof to feed the Lamps continually. Under this stately Emblem you have a lively representation of the spiritual Gifts and Graces distilled by the Spirit into the Ministers of the Gospel, for the use and benefit of the Church, as you find not only by the Angels Exposition of it here, but by the Spirits allusion to it, and accommodation of it in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3, 4. See herein what price God puts upon the salvation of Souls: Gospel Lamps are maintain'd for their sakes, not with the sweat of Ministers brows, or the expence and waste of their Spirits, but by the precious Gifts and Graces of Gods Spirit continually dropping into them for the use and service of Souls. These ministerial Gifts and Graces are Christs Ascension-gifts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. <hi>When he ascended up on high, he gave gifts unto men</hi>; and what were the Royal gifts of that triumphant day? why, he <hi>gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.</hi> It is an allusion to the <hi>Roman Triumphs,</hi> wherein the Conqueror did <hi>spargere missilia,</hi> scatter abroad his treasures among the people. It is reported of the <hi>Palm</hi>-tree saith one, that when it was first planted in <hi>Italy,</hi> they water'd its roots with Wine to make it take the better with the Soil; but God waters our Souls with what is infinitely more costly than Wine, he waters them with the Heart-blood of Christ, and the precious Gifts and Graces of the Spirit, which certainly he would never do, if they were not of great worth in his eyes. O how many excellent Ministers who were, as is said of <hi>Iohn,</hi> burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and shining Lights in their places and generations, have spent themselves, and how many are there who are willing to spend and be spent, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, for the salvation of Souls! God is at great expences for them, and therefore puts a very high value upon them.</p>
               <p>Now all this respects the Soul of man, that is the object of all ministerial labours. The Soul is the <hi>terminus actionum ad intra,</hi> the subject on which God works, and upon which he spends all those invaluable treasures. 'Tis the Soul which he aims at, and principally designs and levels all to, and reckons it not too dear a rate to save them at.</p>

the instruments that would be worn out being of far greater value than the thing. This may convince us of what worth our Souls are, and at what rates they are set in Gods Book, that such instruments are sent abroad into the World, and such precious Gifts and Graces like golden Oyl spent continually for their Salvation: whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> all are yours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> all set apart for the service and salvation of your Souls.</p>

               <p>There cannot be a more acceptable service done to God, than for a man to set himself heartily and diligently to the Conversion of Souls: so many Souls as a man instrumentally saves, so many <hi>Diadems</hi> will God crown him withal in the great Day. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls his converted <hi>Philippians</hi> his <hi>joy and his crown,</hi> Phil. 4.1. and tells the converted <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> they were his <hi>Crown of rejoycing in the presence of Iesus Christ at his coming,</hi> 1 Thess. 2.19. There is a full reward assured by promise to those that labour in this great service, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.</hi> The wisdom here spoken of I conceive not to be only that whereby a man is made wise to the salvation of his own Soul, but whereby he is also furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with skill for the saving of other mens Souls, according to that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.30. <hi>He that winneth souls is wise:</hi> and so the latter Phrase is exegetical of it, meaning one and the same thing by being wise, and turning many unto righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: and to put men upon the study of this wisdom, he puts a very honourable title upon them, calling them <gap reason="foreign">

Here is singular honour put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very instruments imploy'd in this honourable service, and that is not all; but their reward is great hereafter, as well as their honour great at present: they shall <hi>shine as the brightness of the firmament, and the stars for ever and ever.</hi> The Firmament shines like a Saphir in it self, the Stars and Planets more gloriously again; but those that faithfully la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

in this work of saving Souls, shall shine in Glory for ever and ever, when the Firmament shall be parched up as a scrowl. O what rewards and honours are here to provoke men to the study of saving Souls! God will richly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense all our pains in this work: if we did but only sow the seed in our days, and another enters into our labours, and waters what we sowed, so that neither the first hath the comfort of finishing the work, nor the last the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it; but one did somewhat towards it in the work of Conviction, and the other carried it on to greater matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and perfection, and so neither the one or other began and finished the work singly; yet both shall rejoyce in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven together, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.36.</p>
               <p>You see what honours God puts upon the very instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments imploy'd in this work, even the honour to be Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours under God of mens Souls, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.20. and what a full reward of glory, joy, and comfort they shall have in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: all which speaks the great value of the Soul with God. Such encouragements and such rewards would never have been propounded and promised, if God had not a singular estimation of them.</p>
               <p>And the more to quicken his instruments to all diligence in this great work, he works upon their fears as well as hopes; threatens them with <hi>Hell,</hi> as well as incourages them with the hopes of Heaven: tells them he will require the blood of all those Souls that perish by their negligence; Their blood, saith he, will I require at that watch-mans hands, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.6. which are rather Thunderbolts than words, saith <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> By all which you see what weight God lays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the saving or losing of Souls: such severe charges, great encouragements, and terrible threats had never been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in Scripture, if the Souls of men had not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuably precious.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Eleventhly, It is no small evidence of the preciousness and invaluable worth of Souls, that God manifests so great and tender <hi>Care</hi> over them, and is so much concern'd about the evil that befals them.</p>
               <p>Among many others, there are two things in which the tender care of God for the good of Souls is manifested,

                     <item>(2.) His special regard to Souls is evidenced in his severe prohibitions to all others to do nothing that may be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of ruine to them. He charges it upon all, <hi>That no man put a stumbling-block, or an occasion to fall in his brothers way,</hi> Rom. 14.13. that by the abuse of our own liberty, <hi>we destroy not him for whom Christ died,</hi> Rom. 14.15.

                  <hi>Heirs of Salvation</hi>] And in some respect nearer to Christ than themselves are; on this account it is that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels delight to serve them. Christs little ones upon earth have their Angels, which always behold the face of God in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. and therefore saith our Lord there, <hi>Take heed you despise not one of these little ones</hi>; they are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er persons than you are aware of. Nor is it enough that one Angel is appointed to wait upon all, or many of them, but many Angels, even a whole Host of them are sometimes sent to attend upon one of them. As <hi>Iacob</hi> was going on his way, the Angels of God met him, and when he saw them, he said, <hi>This is Gods host,</hi> Gen. 32.1, 2.</p>
               <p>The same two offices which belong to a Nurse to whom the Father commits his Child, belong also to the Angels of Heaven, with respect to the Children of God, <hi>viz.</hi> to keep them tenderly whilst they are abroad, and bring them home to their Fathers house at last. And how clearly doth all this evince and demonstrate the great dignity and value of Souls? Was it an Argument of the Grandeur and Magnificence of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he had two hundred men with <hi>Targets,</hi> and three hundred men with Shields of beaten Gold for his ordinary Guard every day?

               <p>And now lay all these Arguments together, and see what they will amount to. You have before you no ordinary Creature; for, (1.) it was not produced as other Creatures were, by a meer word of command, but by the delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great Council of Heaven: and, (2.) such are the

Nor is this its capacity in vain, for God hath made glorious preparations for some of them in Heaven. (5.) And purchased them for Heaven, and Heaven for them at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable price, even the precious Blood of Christ. (6.) And stampt immortality upon their actions, as well as natures. (7) Both Worlds contend and strive for the Soul, as a prize of greatest value. (8) Their Conversion to Christ is the Triumph of Heaven, and Rage of Hell. (9.)

Great rewards are propounded to all that shall hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily endeavour the salvation of them. (11.) The care of Heaven is exceeding great and tender over them. And (12.) the heavenly Host of Angels have the charge of them, and reckon it their honour to serve them. These things duly weighed, bring home the conclusion with demonstrative clearness to every mans understanding, <hi>That one Soul is of more value than the whole World,</hi> which was the thing to be proved. What remains is the improvement of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent subject, in these following Inferences.</p>
               <div n="1" type="inference">
                  <head>Inference I.</head>
                  <p>THE Soul of man appearing to be a Creature of such transcendent dignity and excellency, this truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears of equal clearness with it, <hi>That it was not made for the body, but the body for it; and therefore it is a vile abuse of the noble and high-born Soul, to subject it to the lusts, and enslave it to the drudgery of the inferior and more ignoble part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The very Law of Nature assigns the most honourable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and imployments to the most noble and excellent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the baser and inferior to things of the lowest rank and quality. The Sun, Moon, and Stars are placed by this Law in the Heavens, but the <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> and the Glow-worm in the Fens and Ditches. <hi>Princes</hi> are set upon Thrones of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:63760:207"/>
Glory, the <hi>Beggers</hi> lodg'd in Barns and Stables: and if at any time this order of Nature be inverted, and the baser sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and perk over the more noble and honourable Beings, it is looked upon as a kind of Prodigy in the Civil World: and so <hi>Solomon</hi> represents it, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10.7. <hi>I have seen servants upon horses, and Princes walking as servants upon the earth, (i. e.)</hi> I have seen men that are worthy of no better imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than to rub Horses heels, in the Saddle, with their Trappings; and men who deserve to bear rule and to govern Kingdoms, men who for their great ability and integrity deserved to sit at Helm, and moderate the Affairs of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, these have I seen walking as servants upon the earth, and this he calls an evil under the Sun, that is an <hi>Ataxie,</hi> confusion or disorder in the course of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Now there can never be that difference and vast odds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one man and another, as there is betwixt the Soul and the body of every man. A King upon the Throne is not so much above a Begger that cryes at our doors for a crust, as the Soul is above a body; for the Soul of a Begger is of the same Species, Original, and Capacity of happiness with the Soul of the most illustrious Prince: and sometimes greater Excellencies of mind are found in the lowest rank and order of men; <hi>Better is a poor and wise child, than an old and foolish King,</hi> Eccles. 4.13. but the Soul of the meanest person in the World, is better than all the bodies in it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make the noble and high-born Soul a slave, a meer drudge to the vile body; as the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. <hi>The body of this vileness</hi>; what is it but to set the Begger on Horse-back, and make the King lacquey after him on foot.</p>
                  <p>It was a generous resentment that an Heathen had of the dignity of his own Soul,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Major sum, &amp; ad majora na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, quàm ut corporis mei sim mancipium.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca.</note> and a very just abhorrence of so vile an abuse of it, when he said, <hi>I am greater, and born to greater things, than that I should be a slave to my body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know there is a debt of duty the Soul owes to its own body, and few Souls are to be found too careless or dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in the discharge thereof: where one Soul needs the <hi>Spur</hi> in this case, thousands need the <hi>Curb.</hi> Most Souls are over-heated with zeal for the concerns of the flesh, worn out and spent in its constant drudgery: their whole life is but a <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of divers lusts and pleasures,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3.
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:63760:207"/>
Imperious lusts are cruel Task-masters, they give the Soul no rest; the more provision the Soul brings in to satisfie them, the more they rage, like fire by the addition of more fuel. What a sad sight is it to see a noble immortal Soul <hi>enslaved,</hi>

                  <p>O what perpetual hurry and noise do thousands of Souls live in! so that they have no time to retire into themselves, and think for what end and use they were created, and sent into this World: all their thoughts, all their cares, all their studies and labours are taken up about that perishing, clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, ensnaring body, which must so shortly fall a prey to the worms. How many millions of poor Creatures are there that labour and toil all their life long for a poor, bare main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their bodies, and never think they have any other business to do in this World?</p>
                  <p>And how many of an higher rank are charm'd by a thick succession of fleshly delights and pleasures into a deep ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion of their eternal concerns? so that their whole life is but one intire diversion from the great business and proper end of it: <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Ye have lived in pleasure on earth,</hi> lived in them, as the fish doth in the water, its proper Element, or the <hi>Eel</hi> in the mud. Sometimes it falls out at the very close of a vain voluptuous life, when they see all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights shrinking away at the approaches and appearance of death; that they begin to be a little startled at the change which is about to be made upon them, and to cry, O what shall we do now! Ah poor Souls, is that a time to think what you shall do, when you are just stepping into the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful state of Eternity? O that this had been thought on in season; but you could find no leisure for one such thought. Now you begin to wish time had been rescued out of the hands of the cares and pleasures of this life for better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses; but it's gone, and never more to be recalled.</p>

Thy Soul, O man, is more worth than the Crowns and Treasures of all the Princes in the World: if all their Exchequers were drained, and all their Crown-Jewels sold to their full value, they could never make up half a Ransom for the Soul of the poorest and meanest man. This invaluable Treasure is committed to your charge, if it be lost, you are lost for ever: that which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> calls the losing of the Soul in my Text, St. <hi>Luke</hi> calls <hi>losing himself:</hi> if the Soul be lost, the man is lost: the body is but as a Boat fastned to the stern of a stately Ship, if the Ship sink, the Boat follows it.</p>
                  <p>O therefore what thoughts, what fears, what cares should exercise the minds of men day and night, till their precious Souls be out of all danger! Methinks the sound of this <hi>Text</hi> should ring a perpetual <hi>Alarm</hi> in the ears of careless sinners, and make them hasten to the Ensurance-Office, as Merchants do, who have great Adventures in danger at Sea. It was counsel given once to a King, and worthy to be prest upon all, from the King to the Begger, to ruminate these words of Christ one quarter of an hour every day, <hi>What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi> certainly it would make men slack their pace, and cool themselves in their hot and earnest pursuit of the trifles of this World, and convince them, that they have somewhat else to do of far greater importance.</p>

                  <p>Many Souls never spent one solemn hour in a close and serious debate about this matter, others have taken a great deal of pains about it, they have broken many nights sleep, poured out many prayers, made many a deep search into their own hearts, walked with much conscientious watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and tenderness, proposed many a serious case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to the most judicious and skilful Ministers and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: and after all, their security is not such as fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies; and probably one reason of it may be the great weight wherewith the matters of their Salvation lye upon their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.

Hence Christ forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Faith of Christians against all distrusts of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, even from their Excellency above other Creatures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Ye are of more value than many sparrows:</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.26. your heavenly Father feeds the Fowls of the Air, <hi>and are ye not much better than they?</hi> and <hi>vers.</hi> 30. he cloaths the grass of the field, <hi>and shall he not much more cloath you?</hi> And so the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.9. <hi>Doth God take care for oxen? or saith he it altogether for our sakes? for our sakes no doubt this is written.</hi> In all which places the dignity of man above all <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Vegetables,</hi> in respect of both natural Excellency of his reasonable Soul, but especially the gracious endowments of it, which endear it far more to its Maker: this is the very hing of the Argument, and a firm ground for the Believers Faith of Gods tender care over both parts, but especially the Soul. The body of a Believer is Gods Creature as well as his Soul; but that being of less value, hath not such a degree of care and tenderness expressed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, as the Soul hath: the Fathers care is not so much for the Childs cloaths, as it is for the Child himself. Besides, the immediate wants and troubles of the Soul, which are <hi>Idiopathetical,</hi> are far more sharp and pinching than those it suffers upon the bodies account, which are but <hi>Sympathetical</hi>; and therefore when-ever such an excellent Creature, as a sanctified Soul, which is in Christ, or a Soul designed to be sanctified, which is moving towards Christ, fall under those heavy pressures and distresses, (as they often do) and are ready to fail; let it be assured its merciful Creator will not
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:63760:209"/>
fail to relieve, support, revive, and deliver it as often as it shall fall into those deep distresses.</p>
                  <p>Hear how his compassionate tenderness is expressed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards distressed Souls, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.15. <hi>Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sooner shall a <hi>Woman,</hi> the more tender <hi>Sex,</hi> forget not the Nurse-child that only sucks her breast, but the child, yea the son of her womb, and that not when grown and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced abroad, but whilst it hangs upon her breast, and draws love from her heart, as well as milk from her breast; than God will forget a Soul that fears him. Let gracious Souls fortifie their Faith therefore in the Divine care, by consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with what a peculiar eye of estimation and care God looks upon them above all other Creatures in the World: only beware you so eye not the natural or spiritual excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of your Souls, as to expect mercy for the sake thereof, as if your Souls were worthy for whose sake God should do this: no, no, sin hath nonsuited that Plea, all is of free Grace, not of debt; but he minds us what reputation the new Creation brings the Soul into with its God.</p>

                  <p>O Parents, consider with your selves what strong engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lye upon you to do all you are capable of doing for the salvation of the precious Souls of your dear Children. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their Souls are infinitely of more value than their bodies, that they came into the World under sin and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; that you were the instruments of propagating that sin to them, and bringing them into that misery; that you know their dispositions, and how to suit them better than others can. That the bonds of Nature give you singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar advantages to prevail, and be successful in your exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beyond what any others have; that you are always

with them, and can chuse your opportunities, which others cannot. That you and they must shortly part, and never meet them again, till you meet at the Judgment-seat of Christ. That it will be inconceivably dreadful to see them stand at Christs left hand among the cursed and condemned, there cursing the day that ever they were born of such igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and negligent, such careless and cruel Parents as took no care to instruct, reprove, or exhort them. O who can think without horrour of the cryes and curses of his own Child in Hell, cast away by the very instrument of its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
                  <p>Is this the love you bear them, to betray them to eternal misery? Was there no other provision to be made, but for their bodies? Did you think you had fully acquitted your duty, when you had got an Estate for them? O that God would effectually touch your hearts with a becoming sense of the value and danger of their Souls, and your own too in the neglect of that great and solemn trust committed to you with respect to them. And you Masters, consider, though God hath set you above, and your Servants below, yet are their Souls equally precious with your own: they have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Master that expects service from them, as well as you: do not only allow them time, but give them your exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and commands, not to neglect their own Souls, whilst they attend your business: think not your business will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper the less, because it is in the hand of a praying servant; their Souls are of greater concernment than any business of yours can be.</p>

                  <p>Then do we live like Christians, when the cares of our bodies are swallowed up and subdued by the cares of our Souls, and all Creature-loves by the love of Christ: those blessed Souls hated their own bodies, and counted them their enemies, when they would draw them from Christ and his Truths, and plunge their Souls into guilt and danger. This was the result of all their debates with the flesh in the hour of temptation, Cannot we live but to the dishonour of Christ, and ruine of our own Souls by sinful compliance against our Conscience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, then welcome the worst of deaths rather than such a life.</p>
                  <p>Look into the stories of the Martyrs, and you shall find this was the rule they still governed themselves by; a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, a Stake, a Gibbet, any thing rather than guilt upon the inner man: death was welcome even in its most dreadful form, to escape ruine to their precious and immortal Souls. One kissed the Apparitor that brought him the tidings of his death. Another being advised, when he came to the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical point on which his life depended, to have a care of
<pb facs="tcp:63760:213"/>
himself; So I will, said he, I will be as careful as I can of my best self, my Soul. These men understood the value and precious worth of their own Souls; and certainly we shall never prove couragious and constant in sufferings, till we understand the worth of our Souls, as they did. Consider and compare these sufferings in a few obvious particulars, and then determine the matter in thine own breast.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) How much easier it is to endure the torments of men in our bodies, than to feel the terrors of God in our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? Can the Creature strike with an arm like God? O think what it is for the wrath of God to come into a mans bowels like water, and like oyl into his bones, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 109.18. Sure there is no compare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the strokes of God and men.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The sufferings of the body are but for a moment. When the <hi>Proconsul</hi> told <hi>Polycarp</hi> that he would tame him with fire: he replied, Your fire shall burn but for the space of an hour, and then it shall be extinguished; but the fire that shall devour the wicked will never be quenched: the sufferings of a moment are nothing to eternal sufferings.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Sufferings for Christ are usually sweetned and made easie by the consolations of the Spirit; but Hell-torments have no relief, they admit of no ease.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) The life you shall live in that body, for whose sake you have damned your Souls, will not be worth the having: it will be a life without comfort, light or joy: and what is there in life, separate from the joy and comfort of life?</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) In a word, if you sacrifice your bodies for God and your Souls, freely offer them up in love to Christ and his Truth: your Souls will joyfully receive and meet them again at the Resurrection of the Just; but if your poor Souls be now ensnared and destroyed by their fond indulgence to their bodies, you will leave them at death despairing, and meet them at the Resurrection howling.</p>

                  <head>Inference IX.</head>
                  <p>TO conclude, <hi>If the Soul be so invaluably precious, how great and irreparable a loss must the loss of a Soul to all Eternity be!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a double loss of the Soul of man, the one in <hi>Adam,</hi> which loss is recoverable by Christ; the other by final impenitence and unbelief, cutting it off from Christ, and this is irreparable and irrecoverable. Souls lost by <hi>Adams</hi> sin are within the reach of the arms of Christ; but in the shipwrack of personal infidelity there is no plank to save the Soul so cast away: Of all losses this is the most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, yet what more common? O what a shrlek doth the unregenerate Soul make, when it sees whereto it must, and that there is no remedy! Three cries are dreadful to hear on Earth, yet all three are drown'd by a more terrible cry in the other World. The cry of a condemned Prisoner at the Bar, the cry of drowning Seamen and Passengers in a shipwrack, the cries of Souldiers conquer'd in the field; all these are fearful cries, yet nothing to that of a Soul cast away to all Eternity, and lost in the depth of Hell.</p>
                  <p>If a man, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> well observes, lose an eye, an arm, a hand, or leg, it is a great loss: but yet if one be lost, there is another to help him; for <hi>omnia Deus dedit duplicia,</hi> God hath given us all those members double: <hi>animam verò unam,</hi> but we have but one Soul, and if that be damned, there is not another to be saved.</p>
                  <p>And it is no small aggravation to this loss, that it was a wilful loss. We had the offers and means of Salvation plentifully afforded us: we were warn'd of this danger over and over: we were intreated and beseecht upon the knee of importunity, not to throw away our Souls by an obstinate rejection of Christ and Grace: we saw the diligence and care of others for the salvation of their Souls; some rejoycing in the comfortable assurance of it, and others giving all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make their calling and election sure: we knew that our Souls were as capable of blessedness as any of those that are in enjoying God in Heaven, or panting after that enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:63760:214"/>
on Earth; yea, some Souls that are now irrecoverably gone, and many others who are going after them, once were, and now are not far from the Kingdom of God: they had convictions of sin, a sense of their lost and miserable state, they began to treat with Christ in Prayer, to converse with his Ministers and People about their condition: and after all this, even when they seemed to have clean escaped the snares of Satan, to be again intangled and overcome; when even come to Harbours mouth, to be driven back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and cast away upon the Rocks: O what a loss will this be!</p>

               <p>

And this is the case of the far greater part of even the professing World. Let us suppose a number of blind men upon an <hi>Island,</hi> where there are many smooth paths all leading to the top of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular cliff; and these blind men going on continually, some in one path, and some in another: but all in some one of those many paths which lead to the brink of their ruine which they see not; it must needs follow, if they all move forward, the whole number will in a short time be cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the <hi>Island</hi> clear'd, and its Inhabitants dead and lost in the bottom of the Sea. This is the case of the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate World: they are now upon this habitable spot of earth, environed with the vast Ocean of Eternity, there are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of paths leading to eternal misery, one man takes this way, another that; as it is <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. <hi>We have turned every one to his own way</hi>; one to the way of pride, another to the way of covetousness, a third to the way of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a fourth to the way of Civility and Morality, and so on they go, not once making a stand, or questioning to what end it will bring them, till at last over they go at death, and we hear no more of them in this world; and thus one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of sinners follows another, and they that come after approve and applaud those miserable wretches that went before them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.13. and so Hell fills, and the World empties its Inhabitants daily into it. Now I will make it my work out of a dear regard to the precious Souls of men, and in hope to prevent (which the Lord in mercy grant) the loss and ruine of some under whose eyes this Discourse shall fall, to note some of the principal ways in which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls are lost, and to put such bars into them as I am capable to put: and among many more, I will set a mark

upon these following twelve paths, wherein millions of Souls have been lost, and millions more are confidently and securely following after, among which 'tis likely some are within one step, one day or hour to their eternal downfal and destruction. There is but one way in all the world to save and preserve the precious Souls of men, but there are many ways to lose and destroy them: it is here as it is in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural birth and death, but one way into the World, but a multitude out of it.

And to begin where indeed the ruine of very many doth begin, it will be found that <hi>an ill Education is the high way to destruction.</hi> Vice need not be planted; if the <hi>Gardiner</hi> neglect to dress, sow, and manure his Garden, he need not give the weeds a greater advantage; but if he also scatter the seed of Hemlock, Docks, and Nettles into it, he spoils it, and makes it fit for nothing. Many Parents, and those godly too, are guilty of too many neglects, through care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness, worldly incumbrances, or fond indulgence, and whilst they neglect the season of sowing better seed, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil takes hold of it; if they will not improve it, he will; if they teach them not to pray, he will teach them to curse, swear, and lye; if they put not the Bible or Catechise into their hands, he will put <hi>obscene Ballads</hi> into them: and thus the off-spring of many godly Parents turn into degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate plants, and prove a generation that know not the God of their Fathers. This debauched Age can furnish us with too many sad instances hereof. Thus they are spoiled in the bud; simple ignorance in youth becomes affected and wilful ignorance in age; blushing sins in children become impudent sins in age: and all this for want of a timely and prudent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting care. Others there are of the rude and ignorant multitude, who are bred themselves much like the Beasts they daily converse withal, and so they are fitly described, <hi>Iob</hi> 30.6, 7. Go into their houses, and you may sooner find in the window, or upon the shelf, a Pack of Cards, than a Bible or Catechise; their Beds and Tables differ little or not at all from the <hi>Stalls</hi> and <hi>Cribs</hi> where beasts lye down
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:63760:216"/>
and feed, in respect of any worship of God among them: or if for fashion sake a few words be hudled over in the evening when their bodies are tired, the man saith something, he scarce knows what, the wife is asleep in one corner, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in another, and the servants in a third. This is the Education multitudes of Parents give their Children all the week; and when the Sabbath comes, the most they learn to know at Church, is where their own seat stands, and that it is necessary to speak with such a Neighbour after Prayers, about such or such a bargain or business for the next week.</p>
                  <p>And others there are who breed their Children as <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely</hi> as these do <hi>sottishly,</hi> teaching them by their Examples the newest Oaths that were last minted in Hell, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile and scoff all serious Godliness and the sincere Professors of it, smiling to hear with what an Emphasis they can talk in the Dialect of Devils, and how wittily they can droll upon godly Ministers and Christians.</p>
                  <p>Such Families are Nurseries for Hell, and though God by an extraordinary hand of Providence now and then snatch a Soul by conversion from among them, as a brand out of the fire, yet generally they die as they live, going to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Fathers where they shall never see light, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.19.

To conclude, Would you heartily seek it of God, and would the Spirit (which he hath promised to give them that ask him) become your Teacher, how soon would the light of the saving knowledge of God in the face of Christ shine into your hearts? No matter how ignorant, dull, and weak the Scholar be, if God once become the Teacher. You are not able to purchase or want time to read many Books; but if once you were sanctified persons, the anointing you would receive from the Father would teach you all things, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27. your own hearts would serve you for a <hi>Commentary</hi> upon a great part of the <hi>Bible</hi>; it would make you of a quick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in the fear of the Lord: one drop of your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge would be more worth than all learned Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the world to you. And is God so far from you, and his illuminating Spirit at such a distance, that there is no hope for you to find him? Is there never a private corner about your Houses or Barns or in the fields, where you can turn aside, if it be but a quarter of an hour at a time to pour out your Souls to God, and beg the Spirit of him? Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Wretch! is thy whole life such a cumber, and clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of cares and puzzles about the World, that thou hast no leisure to mind God, Soul, or Eternity?

                  <p>Thus the <hi>Ephesians</hi> in their unregenerate state <hi>walked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the course of this world,</hi> Eph. 2.2. and the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were carried away unto dumb Idols, even as they were led,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. just as a drop of water is carried and moved according to the course and current of the Tide: For look as every drop of water in the Sea is of one and the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature, so are all carnal and unsanctified persons: and as these waters being collected into one vast body in the Ocean, unite their strength, and make a strong current this way or that; so doth the whole collective body of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate World, all the particular drops move as the Tide moveth. Hence they are said <hi>to have received the spirit of the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.12. one common Spirit or Principle acts and rules them all, and therefore they must needs be carried away in the same course. And there are two special consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations that seem to determine them, by a kind of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do as the multitude do; the one is, that they find it the easiest and most commodious way to the flesh, here they meet with quietness and safety; hereby they are exempt from reproaches, losses, persecutions, and distresses for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake: rest is sweet, and here only they think to find it. The other is the prejudice of singularity, and manifold tribulations they see that little handful that walk counter to the course of the World involved in; this startles them from their company, and fixes them where they are. Against such sensible Arguments it is to no more purpose to oppose spritual Considerations, motives drawn from the safety of the Soul, or importance of Eternity, than it is for a man to turn the Tide or course of a River with his weak breath.</p>

                  <head>The fourth way to Hell shut up, by two Considerations.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. First, Let it be considered; the longer any man hath been engaged in, and accustomed to the way of sin, the more reason and need that man hath speedily and without delay to repent, and reform his course; there is yet a possibility of mercy, a season of Salvation left, how far soever a Soul be gone on towards Hell: none can say it is yet too late. When Mr. <hi>Bilney</hi> the Martyr heard a Minister preaching thus, O thou old Sinner, that hast gone on in a course of sin these fifty or sixty years, dost thou think that Christ will accept thee now? or take the Devils leavings? Good God! said he, what preaching of Christ is here? Had such Doctrine been preached to me in the day of my troubles, it had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough utterly to have discouraged me from Repentance and Faith. No, no, Sinner, it is not yet too late, if at last thy heart be touched with a real sense of thy sin and danger: the word is plain, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An abundant pardon thou needest; thy sins by long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued custom and frequent repetitions have been abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aggravated; and an abundant pardon is with God for poor sinners: he will abundantly pardon, but then thou must come up to his terms; thou must not expect pardon or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when thy sins have forsaken thee, but upon thy forsaking them: yea, such a forsaking as includes a resolution or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in thy will to return to them no more, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.8. there must be a change of thy way, and that not from profaneness to civility only, which is but to change one false way to Heaven for another, or the dirty road to hell for a clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier path on the other side the hedge; but a total and final forsaking of every way of sin, as to the love and habitual
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:63760:223"/>
practice of it; yea, and thy thoughts too, as well as thy ways: there must be an internal, as well as an external change upon thee; yea, a positive, as well as a negative change: a turning to the Lord, as well as a turning from sin; and then how long soever thou hast walked in the road towards Hell, there will be time enough, and mercy enough to secure thy returning Soul safe to Heaven.</p>

I have read of a certain Fruit which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which was exceeding pleasant to the taste; but Nature had so fenced it and double-guarded it with sharp and dangerous thorns, that it was very difficult to come at it.

Isa. 41.17. Psal. 34.9, 10. Psal. 91.15. Rom. 8.28.</note> You would suck the breasts of those Promises in the Margent, and say all the dainties in the world cannot make you such another Feast. You would then see your bread, your cloaths, and all provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions for you and yours in Gods promises, when you are brought to an exigence, and would certainly find perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances as well as promises all along the course of your life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Say not you have no time to mind another world, God hath not put any of you under such an unhappy necessity: you have one whole day every week allowed you by God and Man for your Souls: you have some spare time every day, which you know you spend worse than in heavenly thoughts and exercises; yea, most Callings are such as will admit of spiritual exercises of thoughts, even when your hands are exercised in the affairs of this life. Besides, there are none of you but have and must have daily some relaxations and rest from business; and if your hearts were spiritual, and set upon Heaven, you would find more time than you think on, without prejudice to your Callings, yea to the great furtherance of them, to spend with God. I can tell you when and where I have found poor Servants hard at work for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:63760:226"/>
labouring for Christ, some in the Fields, others in Barns and Stables, where they could find any privacy to pour out their Souls to God in prayer. As Lovers will make hard shifts to converse together, so will the Soul that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to God, and in earnest for Heaven. And though your opportunities be not so large, they may be as sweet as suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful, and to be sure sincere, as those whose condition affords them more time, and greater external conveniencies than you enjoy. More business is sometimes dispatcht in a quarter of an hour in prayer, yea let me say, in a few hearty ejaculations of Soul to God in a few minutes, than in many long and elaborate duties. If thou cast in thy two mites of time into the Treasury of Prayer, having no more, thou mayst, as Christ said of the poor Widow, give more than those that cast in of their great abundance of time and Talents.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Lastly, Consider, Jesus Christ is no Respecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the poorest and vilest on earth are as welcome to him as the greatest. He chose a poor and mean condition in this World himself, conversed mostly among the poor, never refused any because of his poverty: <hi>God accepteth not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; for they are all the work of his hands,</hi> Job 34.19. and that both in respect of their natural constitution as men, and their Civil condition as rich or poor men. Riches and poverty make a great difference in the respects of men, but none at all with God. If thou be one of Gods poor, he will accept, love, and honour thee above the greatest (if graceless) person in the world. Poverty is no bar to Christ or Heaven, though it be to the respects of men and pleasures of this life. Away then with all vain pretences against a life of godliness from the meanness of your outward condition. Heaven was not made for the rich, and Hell only for the poor; no, no: how hard soever you find the way thither, I am sure Christ saith, It's hard for a rich man to enter into that Kingdom.</p>

by presumption they have hope, and by that hope they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>
                  <p>There are divers objects of Presumption, amongst which these three are most usual and most fatal: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That they have
<list>
                        <item>1. That Grace which they have not.</item>
                        <item>2. That Mercy in God they will not find.</item>
                        <item>3. That Time before them which will fail them.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Many presume they have that Grace in them, which God knoweth they have not: So did <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Rev. 3.17. <hi>Thou sayest, I am rich, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable, poor, blind and naked.</hi> Here is a dangerous Conspiracy betwixt a cunning Devil, and an ignorant proud Heart, to ruine the Soul for ever: they stamp their common Grace for special: they put the old Creature, by a general Profession, into the new Creatures habit, and lay a confident claim to all the Priviledges of the Children of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They presume upon such Mercy in God, as they will never find: they expect pardoning and saving Mercy out of Christ, in an unregenerate state, when there is not one drop of Mercy dispensed in any other way. The whole oeconomy of Grace is managed by the Mediator, <hi>Iude v.</hi> 21. all saving Mercies come through him, upon all that are in him, and upon no others. God is indeed a merciful God, and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous sinners will find Judgment without Mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not found in the proper way and method of Mercy. Thousands and ten thousands carve out and dispose the Mercy of God at their own pleasure, write their own Pardons in what Terms they think fit; and if they had Gods Seal to firm and ratifie them, it were all well: but alas! it is but a night-vision, a dream of their own brain.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But especially, men presume upon Time enough for Repentance hereafter: they question not but there be as fit and as fair opportunities of Salvation to come, as are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy past; and in this snare of the Devil thousands are taken
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:63760:227"/>
in the very prime and vigour of their youth. That age is voluptuous, and loves not to be interrupted with severe and serious thoughts and courses; and here is a Salvo fitted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to suit their inclination, and quiet them in their way, that they may pursue their lusts without interruption.</p>
                  <p>I cannot follow the sin of Presumption at present in all these its courses and ways, and will therefore apply my self to the case last mentioned, which is so common to the world.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The seventh way to destruction shut up by five weighty Considerations.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. And in the first place, I would beg all those young voluptuous Sinners, whose feet are fast held in the snare of this Temptation, seriously to bethink themselves, whether they are not old enough to be damned, whilst they judge themselves too young to be seriously godly. There are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes in Hell of your age and size: you may find Graves in the Church-yard of your own length, and Skulls of your own size. Men will not spare a nest of young Snakes, because they are little. If you die Christless and unregenerate, 'tis the same thing whether you be old or young: there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of young Spray, as well as old Logs, burning in the flames of Hell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you knew the weight and difficulty of Salvation-work, you would never think you could begin too soon. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a business will take up all your time:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Poenitet me, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, quod serò te amavi.</hi> Aug.</note> many have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented they began so late, none that they began too soon. Say not, the penitent <hi>Thief</hi> found mercy at the last hour, for his Conversion was extraordinary, and we must not hope for Miracles. Besides, he could never encourage himself in sin with the hope and expectation of such a miraculous Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. He was the only Example of a Sinner that was ever so recovered in Scripture, and this was recorded not to nourish presumption, but to prevent despair. If ten thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons died of the Plague, and one only of the whole number infected with it escaped, it's no great encouragement that you shall make the second. O think and think again, how many thousands now on earth have been tugging and striving
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:63760:228"/>
forty or fifty years together to make their Calling and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction sure, and yet to this day it is not so sure as they would have it: they are afraid after all, time will fail them for finishing, and you think 'tis too early for beginning so great a work.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Others have begun sooner than you, and finished the great and main work before you have done one stroke. <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> was very young, scarce got out of his childhood, when the Grace of God was found in him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.13. The fear of God was in <hi>Obadiah</hi> when but a youth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.12. <hi>Timothy</hi> was not only a Christian, but a Preacher of the Gospel in the morning of his life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. What have you to plead for your selves, which they had not? Or what arguments and motives to godliness had they, which you have not? You shall be judged <hi>per pares,</hi> by those of your own age and size; their seriousness shall condemn your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The morning of your life is the flower of your time, the freshest and fittest of all your life for your great work: now your hearts are tender and impressive, your affections flowing and tractable, your heads clear of distracting cares and hurries of business, which come on afterwards in thick successions: <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, whilst the evil days come not,</hi> Eccles. 12.1, 2. If a man have an important business to do, he will take the morning for it, knowing if that be slipt, a crowd and hurry of business will come on afterwards to distract and hinder him. I presume if all the Converts in the World were examined in this point, it would be found that at least ten to one were wrought upon in their youth: that is the moulding age.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And if this proper, hopeful season be elapsed, it is very unlikely that ever you be wrought upon afterwards. How thin and rare in the world are the instances and examples of Conversion in old age? Long continued customs in sin harden the heart, fix the will, and root the habits of vice so deep in the Soul, that there is no altering of them: your ears then are so accustomed to the sounds of the Word, that Christ and
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:63760:228"/>
Sin, Heaven and Hell, Soul and Eternity have lost their aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sound and efficacy with you. But it is a question only to be decided by the event, whether ever yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What if your presumption of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fair and proper opportunities hereafter fail you, as it hath failed millions (who had as rational and hopeful a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of them as you can have) where are you then? And if you should have more time and means than you do presume upon, are you sure your hearts will be as flexible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive, as now they are? O beware of this sin of vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, to which the generality of the damned owe their everlasting ruine.</p>

                  <p n="8">VIII. The eighth way of ruining the precious Soul, is by drinking in the Principles of <hi>Atheism,</hi> and living without God in the World.</p>
                  <p>Atheism stabs the Soul to death at one stroke, and puts it quite out of the way of Salvation. Other Sinners are worse than <hi>Beasts,</hi> but <hi>Atheists</hi> are worse than <hi>Devils,</hi> for they believe and tremble: these banish God out of their thoughts, and what they can out of the world, living as <hi>without God in the world,</hi> Eph. 2.12. It is a sin that quencheth all Religion in the Soul: he that knows not his Landlord, cannot pay his Rent: he that assents not to the Being of a God, destroys the foundation of all religious Worship; he cannot fear, love, or obey him, whose Being be believes not: this sin strikes at the Life of God, and destroys the life of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Some are Atheists in <hi>opinion,</hi> but multitudes are so in <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: The fool hath said in his heart there is no God,</hi> Psal. 14.1. Though he hath engraven his N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

he judge through the dark clouds? thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not,</hi> Job 22.14.</p>
                  <p>Others profess to believe his Being, but their lives daily give their lips the lye; for they give no evidence in practice of his fear, love, or dependence on him. If they believe his Being, they plainly shew they value not his favour, delight not in his presence, love not his ways or people; but lye down and rise, eat and drink, live and die without the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or acknowledgment of him, except so much as the Law of the Country, or Custom of the place extorts from them. These dregs of time produce abundance of Atheists of both sorts: many ridicule and hiss Religion out of all Companies into which they come; and others live down all sense of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: they customarily attend indeed upon the external Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it, hear the Word; but when the greatest and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Duties are urged upon them, their inward thought is, this is the Preachers Calling, and the man must say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fill up his hour, and get his living. If they dare not put their thoughts into words, and call the Gospel <hi>Fabula Christi,</hi> the Fable of Christ, as a wicked Pope once did, or say of Hell and the dreadful Sufferings of the Damned, as <hi>Calderinus</hi> the Jesuit did, <hi>tunc credam cum illuc venero,</hi> I will believe it when I see it: yet their hearts and lives are of the same complexion with these mens words. They do not heartily assent to the Truth of the Gospel which they hear; and though bare assent would not save them, yet their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or non-assent will certainly damn them, except the Lord heal their understandings and hearts by the light and life of Religion. To this last sort I shall offer a few things.</p>

An unbelieved Truth never converted or saved one Soul from the beginning of the world, nor never shall to the end of it. Those bodies that have the <hi>Boulema,</hi> or Dog-appetite, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they eat, it affords them no nourishment or satisfaction, they thrive not with the best fare: just so it is with your Souls, no Duties, no Ordinances can possibly do them good: as in Argumentation, no Conclusion, be it never so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly drawn, and strongly inferred, is of any force to him that denies Principles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you assent not to the Truth of the Gospel, you not only make God speak to your Souls in vain, which is fatal to them; but you also make God a lyar, which is the greatest affront a Creature can put upon his Maker: 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a lyar.</hi> Vile dust, darest thou rise up against the God that made thee, and give him the lye!

Are they not all built upon the Veracity of God? which is the firmest foundation and greatest security in the world. Hath he not intermingled for our satisfaction, not only frequent asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but his asseverations and Oath to put all beyond doubt? And yet dare any of you lift up your ignorant blind Understandings against all this, and give him the lye? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the wrath of God shall smoke against every Soul of man that doth so, and his own bitter, lamentable, doleful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience shall be his conviction shortly, except he repent.</p>

                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:63760:230"/>3. Dare any of you give the thoughts of your hearts as certain conclusions under your hand, and stand by them to the last, and venture all upon them?</p>
                  <p>Wretched <hi>Atheist,</hi> bethink thy self, pause a while, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thine own breast, whatever thy vile Atheistical thoughts sometimes are, is there not at other times a fear of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?

When thou readest, or hearest that Text, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already</hi>; His <hi>Mittimus</hi> is already made for Hell: Doth not thy Conscience give thee a secret gird, like a stitch in thy side?

Look upon the Seals and Confirmations of it, hath not God confirmed it by divers Miracles from Heaven, a Seal which neither Men or Devils could counterfeit? And
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:63760:230"/>
don't you see the blessing and power of God accompanying it in the Conversion and wonderful change of mens hearts and lives, which can be done by no other hand than Gods? Say not, the Miracles which confirm the Gospel are but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Traditions, and except you your selves see them wrought, you cannot believe them. There are a thousand things which you do believe, though you never saw them; and what you require for your satisfaction, every man may require the same for his, and so Christ must live in all parts of this World, and repeat his Miracles over and over in all Ages to satisfie the unreasonable incredulity of those that question their truth after the fullest Confirmation and Seal hath been given, that is capable to be given, or the heart of man can desire should be given; and if all this should be done, you might be as far from believing, as now you are; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those that saw and heard the things wrought by Christ, contradicted and blasphemed, and so might you.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Satan who undermines your assent to these things, is forced to give his own: he that tempts you to look on them as <hi>Fables,</hi> himself knows, and is convinced that they are realities, <hi>the Devils also believe and tremble,</hi> Jam. 2.19. they know and feel the truth of these things, though it be their great design and interest to shake your assent to them: they know Christ is the Son of God, and that there will be a day in which he will judge the World in righteousness, and that there are Torments prepared for themselves, and all whom they seduce from God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.29. If you ungod God, you must unman your selves, yea, not only make your selves less than men, but worse than Devils.</p>

You are loth those things should be true, which the Scriptures speak, and are glad of any colourable argument or pretence to still your own Consciences. Is not this the case?

The Hypocrite steals to Hell in a private close way of concealed sin; but the prophane gallop along the publick road at noon-day: <hi>They declare their sin as Sodom, and hide it not:</hi> Isa. 3.9. <hi>The shew of their countenance testifieth against them.</hi> The Hypocrite hath devotion in his countenance, and Heaven in his mouth; you know not by his words or countenance whither he is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the prophane hide it not, they are past shame, and above blushing at the horridst impieties. Look as God hath some Servants more eminent, forward, and couragious in the ways of Godliness than others; men that will not hide their Principles, or be ashamed of the ways of Godliness in the face of danger; so the Devil hath some Servants as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for wickedness, who scorn to sneak to Hell by conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their wickedness, but avow and owne it without fear or shame in the open sight of Heaven and Earth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they come, they defile the Air they breathe in with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid blasphemies and obscene discourses not to be named, and leave a strong scent of Hell behind them.</p>
                  <p>This Age hath brought forth multitudes of these Monsters, the reproach and shame of the Nation that bred them. I have little hope to stop one of them in the career and full speed to

Hell. They have lost the <hi>sense of sin,</hi> the restraints of <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>fear</hi>; and then what is left to check them in their course? I cannot hope that such a Discourse as this shall ever come into their hands, except it be to sacrifice it to the flames: yet not knowing the ways of Providence, which are unsearchable, and what use God may make upon one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or another of these following Considerations, I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to drop a few words upon these forlorn Sinners, as far as they seem to be gone beyond recovery; beseeching the Lord to make way for these things to their hands and hearts, and make them the instruments of pulling some of them as brands out of the burning.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. And first, Let it be laid to heart, that though the case and state of many thousand Souls be doubtful and uncertain, so that neither themselves nor any other know what they are, or to whom they belong: yet our condition is without controversie miserable and forlorn, all men know whose you are, and whither you are going. The Apostle appeals in this case to the Bar of every mans Reason and Conscience, as a thing allowed and yielded by all, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. <hi>For this ye know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ and of God.</hi> This is a clear case, there is no controversie about it. Many there be in a doubtful case, but no doubt of these, they are fast and sure in the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; and as sure as God is a God of Truth, they that die in this condition shall never see his face. And to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Know ye not, that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God. Know ye not?</hi> saith he, <hi>q. d.</hi> Sure you cannot be so ignorant and blind to think that there is any room in Heaven for such wretches as these. If the righteous be scarcely saved, where shall the sinner and the ungodly appear? If all strictness, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, self-denial, diligence, be all little enough to win Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

what hope can there be of those that not only cast off all duties of Religion, but also cast themselves into all the opposite ways and courses which directly lead to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? He that refuseth his food, endangers his life; but he that drinks poison, certainly and speedily destroys it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As far as you are gone in a course of prophaneness, you are not yet gone beyond the reach of Mercy and all hopes of Salvation, if now at last, after all your Debaucheries and prophan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ness, the Lord touch your hearts with the sense of your sinful and miserable estate, and turn your feet to his Testimonies. When the Apostle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. had told us the doom of such men, upon the supposition of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance in that course; yet presently he adds as a motive to their repentance, an Example of Mercy upon such wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as these: <hi>And such were some of you, but ye are washed,</hi> v. 11. The golden Scepter of free Grace hath been held forth to many as prophane and notorious sinners as you, to a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Saul,</hi> to a <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> to a <hi>Manasseh.</hi> 'Tis not the greatness of the sin, but the impenitence and infidelity of the sinner that ruines him. Well then, there is a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of damnation if you go, and yet a possibility of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and mercy before you, a mercy invaluable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay, this is not all; but in some respect there is more probability and hope of your return and repentance, than there is of many others who have led a more sober, smooth, and civil life than you have done. Your prophaneness hath more dishonoured God; but the Morality and Civility of some men secures them faster in the snare of the Devil: they have many things in themselves to build up their presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hopes upon, but you have nothing. It is hard for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to reach that mans Conscience that hath a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his own to trust in; but methinks it should have an easier access to yours, whose notorious courses lay your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences naked and bare before the word to be wounded by it. Christs Ministry had little success among the <hi>Pharisees</hi> who were righteous in their own eyes, but it wrought effectually upon <hi>Publicans</hi> and sinners. Hence Christ told them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21.31. That <hi>Publicans and Harlots go into the Kingdom of God

before them. Publicans</hi> were esteemed the worst of men, and <hi>Harlots</hi> the worst of women; yet the one and other, as vile as they were, stood fairer for Conviction, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Salvation, than those that thought they needed no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. All this is matter of hope, and runs into a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motive and loud call to repentance: He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.</p>

Some have sucked in such Opinions of the ways of Godliness, as make them irreconcileable Enemies to them, and fierce Opposers of them. And from hence are most of the Persecutions that befal the People of God. When you see showres of slanders and reproaches go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, expect storms of persecution coming after.

So the primitive Christians were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Heathens as Monsters, and their Conventions in the night, occasioned by the fury of Persecutors, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be for lascivious and barbarous ends, to deflower Virgins, and murder innocent Children: and by this artifice the Heathens were secured against conversion to Christ. This

                  <p>And how many Professors, who pretend to more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reformation and holiness, do shed Soul blood by their scandalous conversations? <hi>Salvian</hi> brings in the wicked of his Age upraiding the loosness of Christians in this manner: Behold, those men who boast themselves redeemed from the Tyranny of Satan, and profess themselves dead to the world, yet are conquer'd by the lusts of it.

Ox or Ass fall into the pit, you are bound to deliver him, if you can; and will you not do as much for a precious Soul, as you would do for a Beast? Nay, you dig pits by your scandalous lives to destroy them. If you sin, there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments enough to spread it, and multitudes of Souls ready perpared to take the infection.

                  <p>O therefore if you have any regard to the precious Souls of men, live up to the rules of your Profession. O be blame, less and harmless, the Sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a perverse and froward generation: let the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of your Conversation stop those mouths that accuse you as men of a worldly Spirit: let them see by your mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in seeking it, your patience in losing it, your readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in distributing it, that it is a groundless calumny under which your Names suffer. Let them see by your apparel, company, and discourses you are not such proud lofty Spirits as you are represented to be. Convince them by your flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness to all things that are lawful and expedient, by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing as much as in you lieth, that it is the pure bond and tye of Conscience which keeps you from compliance in all other things, and by your meekness in suffering for such non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance, that you are not such turbulent, factious Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, as the wicked world slanderously reports you to be. Convince the world by your exact righteousness in all your civil dealings, and by the lip of truth in all your promises and engagements, that you have the fear of God in your hearts, as well as the Livery of Christianity upon your backs. In a word, so live that none may have just ground to believe the impudent slanders the Devil raises in the world against you.

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:63760:234"/>
away for ever, by receiving prejudices against Godliness from the miscarriages of some that make more than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profession of it. If others stumble before you, and break their shins, don't you stumble at them, and break your necks. To prevent this fatal effect of scandal and prejudice at Religion, I desire a few particulars may be impartially weighed.</p>
                  <p>First, Very many of those Scandals bandied up and down the World against the Professors of Godliness, are devised and forged in Hell, as so many traps and snares to catch and destroy mens Souls, to beget an irreconcileable aversation and enmity in men to the ways of God. <hi>They devise deceitful matters</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>against them that are quiet in the land,</hi> Psal. 35.20. So <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Come, say they, let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise devices against Ieremiah, and smite him with the tongue.</hi> And there is as as little equity in the credulous receiver, as there is honesty in the wicked forger of these slanders. With one arrow of censure you wound no less than three, <hi>viz.</hi> the honour of God, your innocent Brother, and your own Souls: as to the two former wounds, they will in due time be healed. God will vindicate his own Name fully, and the reputation of his innocent Servants shall be cleared and repaired abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly; but mean time your Souls may perish by the wounds, prejudices have given, so that you may never be reconciled to Godliness and its Professors whilst you live, but turn Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers and Persecutors of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Examine whether the matters that are charged upon them as their <hi>Crimes,</hi> be not their <hi>Duties.</hi> Sometimes it falls out to be so, and if so, you fight more immediately and directly against God than men. This was <hi>Davids</hi> case, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.10. <hi>When I wept, and chastened my soul, that was to my reproach:</hi> my piety was turned to reproach. They called his tears Crocodiles tears, and his fastings hypocritical shadows of devotion and humility. Thus the very matter of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was turned into reproach. And so it was with the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians, their very owning of themselves to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, was crime enough to condemn them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If Professors of Religion do in some things act unbecoming their holy Profession, yet every slip and failing in their lives is no sufficient Warrant for you to censure their persons as hypocrites, much less to fall upon Religion
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:63760:234"/>
it self, and condemn it for the faults of them that profess it. There's many an upright heart overtaken by temptation. You see their miscarriages, but you see not their humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and self-condemnations before God for them.

O this is he that was so grand a Zealot, that the zeal of Gods house did eat him up. This is the man that, out of his transcendent zeal, danced before the Ark. This is he that prayed thrice a day, at morning, noon, and night. This is he that was so precise and strict in his family, that a wicked person should not dwell in his house. This your great precise Zealot hath defiled the Wife, and murdered the Husband. Now you see what his Religion is, now you see what comes of this profession of so much Holiness and Godliness.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>O that men would seriously consider their evil in such cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures as these. What is all this to Religion? Doth Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion any way countenance or patronize such practices? Nay doth it not impartially and severely condemn them? It is the glory of the Christian Religion, that it is pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.27. These practices flow from no Principle of Religion, nor are chargeable upon it, for it teacheth men the very contrary, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. If I see a Papist sin bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or an <hi>Arminian</hi> slight Grace, I justly condemn their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in and with their practices, because Popery sets Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons to Sale, and Arminianism exalts Nature into the place of Grace: but doth the Doctrine of the Gospel lead to any immoralities? Charge it, if you can.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, And as sensless a thing it is to condemn all for the miscarriages and faults of some, which yet is the common practice of the world. Are all that profess Godliness loose and careless? No, no; many are an ornament to their holy Profession, and the glory of Christianity. And why must the innocent be condemned for the guilty? What is your reason and ground for that? Why might not the Enemies of Christianity have condemned the Eleven Apostles upon the fall of <hi>Iudas?</hi> had they not as good Warrant for it as you have for this?</p>

You speak evil of persons and things you know not, and prejudice is like still to keep you in ignorance of them. <hi>Wo to the world</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>because of offences,</hi> and <hi>Blessed is he that is not offended at me.</hi>

The eleventh way wherein abundance of precious Souls perish in the Christianized and professing World, is the way of <hi>formal Hypocrisie</hi> in Religion, and <hi>Zeal</hi> about the Externals of Worship. Such a generation of men have in all Ages mingled themselves with the sincere Worshippers of God; and the inducement to it is obvious, the form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is an honour, but the power of it a burden. By the former earthly interests are accommodated, by the latter they are frequently exposed and hazarded.</p>
                  <p>We find in the Jewish Church abundance of such chaff in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed with the wheat, which the Doctrine of Christ dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and purged out of the floor, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9, 12. Such were the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who were exceeding zealous for Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the external Rites and Ceremonies of the Law, but inwardly full of all filthiness, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.7, 8, 9. men that honoured the dead, and persecuted the living Saints; that reverenced the material Temple, and destroyed the living Temples; that strain'd at Gnats of Ceremonies, and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down the grossest immoralities.</p>
                  <p>And well had it been, if this generation had ended with that state and time of the Church; but we find a Prophecy of the increase of these men in the later days, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. which is every where sadly verified. Religion runs into stalk and blade, into leaves and suckers, which should be concocted into pith and fruit. Yea, it is of sad considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that amongst many high Pretenders to Reformation, their Zeal which should nourish the vitals of Religion, and maintain their daily work of Mortification and Communion with God, spends it self in some by opinion, whilst practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

Godliness visibly languisheth in their Conversations. How many are there that hate doctrinal errours, who yet perish by practical ones? who hate a false Doctrine, but mean time perish by a false heart?

It holds the Soul fastest on Earth, and sinks it deepest into Hell. There was no sort of men upon whom the Doctrine of Christ and the Apostles had so little success and effect, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees:</hi> they derided him, when Publicans and sinners trembled and believed, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.14, 15. the form of Godliness wards off all convictions: their zeal for the Externals of Religion secures them against the fears of damnation, whilst in the mean while their Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie plunges them deeper into Hell, than others that never made such shews of Sanctimony and Devotion: <hi>He shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him his portion with hypocrites,</hi> Matt. 24.51. that is, he shall be punished in Hell as Hypocrites are punished, <hi>viz.</hi> with the greatest and forest punishment.

                  <head>The twelfth way to Hell opened.</head>
                  <p n="12">XII. The twelfth way to Hell, in which many Souls are carried on smoothly and securely to their own destruction, is the way of meer Civility and moral Honesty, wherein men rest, as in a safe state, never doubting but a civil life will produce and issue into an happy death. Moral honesty is a lovely thing, and greatly tends to the peace and order of the World; but it is not saving Grace, nor gives any man a
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:63760:236"/>
good Title to Christ and Salvation. Indeed there can be no Grace in that Soul, in which Civility and moral Honesty is not found; but this may be found in thousands that have no Grace.</p>
                  <p>That which ruines mens Souls, is not the exercise of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vertues, but their reliance upon them: they use their Morality as a shield to secure their Consciences from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the Word, which would shew them their sinful and miserable state by Nature. Thus the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> Luke 18.11, 12. <hi>God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this Publican:</hi> he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himself in the conceits of his own safety and happiness: Let debauched and prophane persons look to it, I am well enough; though alas! poor man, his being less evil at best could but procure him a cooler Hell or a milder flame. This was the case of the young Man, <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.20. and like a young man indeed he reasons. He summs up all the stock of his civil life, and thinks it strange, if that be not enough to make a purchace of eternal life, <hi>What lack I yet?</hi> Alas! poor Soul, every thing necessary to Salvation: the very first stone was not laid, when he thought the building was finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and this is the case of multitudes, both young and old: and that which greatly confirms and settles them in this their dangerous security, is the general, indistinct Doctrine of some, who pretend to be Guides to the Souls of others; the scope of whose Ministry aims at no higher mark than to civilize the people, and press moral Duties upon them, as if this were all that were necessary to Salvation; nay, 'tis well if some do not industriously pull down the pale of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt Morality and Regeneration, and tell the world in plain English, That there is no reason to put a difference betwixt men that are baptized and live morally honest, and those that have saving Grace; and they that do so, are only a few men who are highly conceited of themselves, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious of all others, whom they please to vote formal and moral.</p>
                  <p>This indeed is the way to fix them where they are; if Christ had not taken another method with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and his Ministers had not pressed the necessity of Regeneration, and the insufficiency of moral honesty to Salvation, how thin
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:63760:237"/>
had the number of true Converts been, though at most they are but an handful in comparison of the unregenerate.</p>
                  <p>O that God would bless what follows, to undeceive and save some poor Soul out of this dangerous snare of the Devil.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The twelfth way to Damnation barred by three Considerations.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Blind not your selves with the lustre of your own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vertues, a life smoothly drawn with Civility through the World; for though it must be acknowledged there is a loveliness and attracting sweetness in Morality and Civility, yet these things rather respect Earth than Heaven, and are designed for the conservation of the order and peace of this World, not for your Salvation and Title to the World to come. Without Justice and Truth, Kingdoms and Common-wealths would become Mountains of prey, and Dens of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery. Where there is no trust, there can be no traffick; and where there is no truth, there can be no trust. Civility is the very Basis of humane Society, a world of good accrues to men by it, and abundance of mischief is prevented by it; but it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave any man an interest in Christ, or a title to Salvation. The <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who perished in the darkness of Heathenism, excelled in Morality: there is nothing of Christ or Regeneration in these things, how much of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency soever be ascribed to them. <hi>Paul</hi> the Pharisee was a blameless person touching the Law, and yet at the same time, not only utterly ignorant of Christ, but a bitter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to him, and all that were his. Till you can find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to Heaven, than by Regeneration, Repentance, and Faith, never lean upon such a deceitful and rotten prop as meer Civility is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Civilized Nature is unsanctified Nature still; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sanctification there is no Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity adorneth Nature, but doth not change it. Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are so many sweet flowers strawed over a dead Corps, which hide the loathsomness of it, but inspire not life into it. Morality hides and covers,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Abscondit, non abscindit vitia.</hi> Lactant.</note> but never mortifies nor cures the corruptions of Nature; and mortified they must be, or you cannot be saved. Take the best Nature in the world, and
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:63760:237"/>
let it be adorned with all the ornaments of Morality, (which they call <hi>Homilitical Vertues</hi>) and add to these, all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts of the Spirit, which are for assistance and ministry; yet all this cannot secure that Soul from Hell, or be the ground-work for a just claim to any promise of Salvation: all this is but Nature improved, not regenerated. Morality is neither produced, as saving Grace is, nor works such effects as Grace worketh. There are no pangs of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance introducing it, it may cost many an aking head, but no asking heart for sin; no such distressed out-cries, as that <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. <hi>Men and Brethren, what shall we do?</hi> Nor doth it produce such humility, self-abasement, heavenly tempers and tendencies of Soul as Grace doth. Cheat not your selves therefore in so important a concern as Salvation is, with an empty shadow.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Civility is not only found in multitudes that are out of Christ, but may be the cause and reason why they are Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. Mistake not, I am not pleading the Cause of Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor disputing Civility out of the world; I heartily wish there were more of it to be found in every place, it would exceedingly promote the peace, order, and tranquility of the world: but yet it is certain, that the eyes of thousands are so dazled with the lustre of their own Morality, that they see no need of Christ, nor feel any want of his Righteousness, and this is the ruine of their Souls. Thus Christ brings in the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> with his proud boast, that he is no Extortioner, Adulterer, nor unjust, or such an one as that <hi>Publican, Luke</hi> 18.11. O what a Saint doth he vote himself when he compared his life with the others! Well then, beware you be not deceived by thinking you are safe, because you are got out of the dirty road to Hell, when all the while you are only stept over the hedge into a cleaner path to damnation. You have had a short account of some few of those many ways in which the precious Souls of men are eternally lost; let us briefly apply it in the following Inferences.</p>

                  <head>Inference I.</head>
                  <p>IF there be so many ways of losing the Soul, and such mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Souls lost in every one of them, <hi>then the number of saved Souls must needs be exceeding small.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The number of the saved may be considered either <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi> or <hi>comparatively.</hi> In the first consideration they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear great and many, even a great multitude which no man can number, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9. but if compared with those that are lost, they make but a small remnant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.9. a little flock, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.32. For when we consider how vastly the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Satan is extended, who is called <hi>the God of this World,</hi> from the world of people who are in subjection to him; how small a part of this earthly Globe is enlightned with the beams of Gospel-light, and that Satan is the acknowledged Ruler of all the rest, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. But when it shall be farther considered, that out of this spot on which the light of the Gospel is risen, the far greatest part are lost also: O what a poor handful remains to Jesus Christ, as the Purchace of his Blood!</p>
                  <p>'Tis of trembling consideration, how many thousands of Families amongst us are meer Nurseries for Hell, Parents bringing forth, and breeding up Children for the Devil, not one word of God (except it be in the way of blasphemy or prophaneness) to be heard among them. How naturally their ignorant and wicked Education puts them in the course and tide of the world, which carries them away irresistibly to Hell. How one sinner confirms and animates another in the same sinful course, till they be all past hope or remedy. How the rich are taken with the baits of sensual pleasures, and the poor lost in the brake of distracting worldly cares, except here and there a Soul pluckt out of the snare of the Devil by the wonderful power and arm of God. On the one side, you may see multitudes drowned in open prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and debauchery; and on the other side, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands securely sleeping in the state of Civility and Morality. Some key-cold, and without the least sense of Religion; others Hell-hot with blind zeal and superstitious madness
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:63760:238"/>
against true Godliness, and the sincere Practitioners of it. Some living all their days under the Ordinances of God, and never touched with any conviction of their sin or misery; others convinced, and making some faint offers at Religion, but their convictions (like blossoms nipt with a frosty mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) fall off, and no fruit follows. And as <hi>Rubies, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phires,</hi> and <hi>Diamonds</hi> are very few in comparison of the Peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and common stones of the Earth; so are true Christians in comparison of multitudes that perish in the snares of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>

                     <hi>HOW little reason have the Vnregenerate to glory and boast themselves in their earthly acquisitions and successes, whilst mean time their Souls are lost!</hi> they have gotten other things, but lost their Souls. 'Tis strange to see how some men by rolling a small Fortune up and down the World, (as Boys do a Snow-ball) have increased the heap, and raised a great Estate, they have attained their design and aim in the world, and hug themselves in the pleased thoughts of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: but alas! among all the thoughts of their gains, there is not one thought of what they have lost. O if such a thought as this could find room in their hearts, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed gotten an Estate, but I have lost my Soul: I have much of the world, but nothing of Christ: Gold and Silver I have, but Grace, peace, and pardon I have not: my body is well provided for, but my Soul is naked, empty, and destitute: such a thought, like the Sentence written on the wall, would make their hearts quail within them. What a rapture and transport of joy did the sight of a full Barn cast that World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into? <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19, 20. <hi>Soul, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry</hi>; little dreaming that death was just then at the door to take away the cloth, guest, and all together; that the next hour his <hi>Friends</hi> would be scrambling for his Estate, the <hi>Worms</hi> for his body, and the <hi>Devils</hi> for his Soul.</p>
                  <p>O how many have not only lost their Souls, whilst they have been drudging for the world, but have sold their Souls to purchase a little of the world! parted by consent with
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:63760:239"/>
their best treasure for a very trifle, and yet think they have a great bargain of it. Surely, if poor sinners did but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what they have lost, as well as what they have gained, their gains would yield them as little comfort, as <hi>Iudas</hi> his money did for which he sold both his Soul and Saviour. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of those pleasing Frolicks of wanton Worldlings, what a cold shiver would run through all their bones and bowels, did they but understand what it is to lose a gracious God and a precious Soul, and both eternally and irrecoverably.</p>
                  <p>The just God remains still to avenge and punish the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but the favour of God, that friendly look is gone, the peace of God, that Heaven upon Earth is gone, the Essence of the Soul remains still, but its purity, peace, joy, hope, and happiness these are gone; and these being gone, what can remain, but a tormenting piercing sight of those things for which you have sold them!</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>HEnce let us estimate the evil of sin, and see what a dreadful thing that is which men commonly sport themselves with, and make so light of: it is not only a wrong and injury to the Soul, but the loss and utter ruine of the Soul for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is said, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.36. <hi>He that sinneth against me, wrongeth his own soul:</hi> And if this were all the mischief sin did us, it were bad enough, a wrong to the Soul is a greater evil than the ruine of the body or estate, and all the outward enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life can be: but to lose the precious Soul, and destroy it to all Eternity, O who can estimate such a loss! Now the result and last effect of sin is death, the death of the precious Soul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. <hi>The end of those things is death.</hi> So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. <hi>The soul that sinneth shall dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sin doth not destroy the Being of the Soul by annihilation, but it doth that which the damned shall find and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be much worse; it cuts off the Soul from God, and deprives it of all its felicity, joy, and pleasure, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the enjoyment of him. Such is dolefulness and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of this result and issue of sin, that when God himself speaks of it, he puts on a passion, and speak of it with the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:63760:239"/>
most feeling concernment, <hi>Ezek</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked: turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye dye, O house of Israel? q. d.</hi> why will ye wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cast away your own Souls? why will ye chuse the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of sin for a season at the price of my wrath and fury poured out for ever? O think upon this, you that make so light a matter of committing sin. We pity those who in the depth of melancholy or desperation lay violent hands upon themselves, and in a desperate mood cut their own throats; but certainly for a man to murder his own Soul, is an act of wickedness as much beyond it, as the value of the Soul is above the body.</p>

                     <hi>WHat an invaluable Mercy is Iesus Christ to the World, who came on purpose to seek and to save such as were lost?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Adam</hi> all were shipwrackt and cast away, Christ is the plank of Mercy let down from Heaven to save some. The loss of Souls by the Fall had been as irrecoverable as the loss of the fallen Angels, had not God in a way above all humane thoughts and counsels contrived the method of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. 'Tis astonishing to consider the admirable Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and glorious Triumph of all the Divine Attributes in this great project of Heaven for the recovery of lost Souls. 'Tis the wonder of Angels, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. the great Mystery of Godliness, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. the matter and burden of the triumphant Song of redeemed Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. and well it may, when we consider a more noble Species of Creatures finally lost, and no Mediator of reconciliation appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and them: this is to save an earthen Pitcher, whilst the Vessel of Gold is let fall, and no hand stretched out to save it.</p>
                  <p>But what is most astonishing is, that so great a Person as the Son of God, should come himself from the Futhers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, to save us by putting himself into our room and stead, being made a Curse for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 13. he leaves the bosom of his Father, and all the ineffable delights of Heaven, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes himself of his Glory, and is found in fashion as man,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:63760:240"/>
yea becomes as a worm and no man, submits to the lowest step and degree of abasement to save lost sinners. What a low stoop doth Christ make in his Humiliation to catch the Souls of poor sinners out of Hell! Herein was love, that God sent his own Son to be the propitiation for our sins, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.10. and so God loved the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. at this rate he was content to save lost sinners.</p>
                  <p>How seasonable was this work of Mercy, both in its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Exhibition</hi> to the World in the Incarnation of Christ, and in its particular <hi>Application</hi> to the Soul of every lost sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the Spirit! When he was first exhibited to the world, he found them all as lost sheep gone astray, every one turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own way, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. he speaks of our lost estate by Nature, both <hi>collectively</hi> or in general, <hi>we all went astray,</hi> and <hi>distributively</hi> or in particular, <hi>every one turned to his own way,</hi> and then in the fulness of time a Saviour appeared.</p>
                  <p>And how seasonable was it in its particular application? How securely were we wandering onwards in the paths of destruction, fearing no danger, when he graciously opened our eyes by conviction, and pulled us back by heart-turning Grace! No Mercy like this: it's an astonishing act of Grace that stands alone.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>Luke</hi> 13.23. a certain person proposed a curious que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to Christ, <hi>Lord, are there few that be saved?</hi> He saw a multitude flocking to Christ, and thronging with great zeal to hear him, and he could not conceive but Heaven must fill proportionably to the numbers he saw in the way thither: but Christs answer, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. at once rebukes the curiosity of the Questionist, fully solves the question propounded, and sets home his own duty and greatest concernment upon him. It rebukes his curiosity, and is as if he should say, Be the number of the saved more or less, what is that to thee? strive thou to be one of them. It fully solves the question
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:63760:240"/>
propounded, by distinguishing those that attend upon the means of Salvation, into <hi>Seekers</hi> and <hi>Strivers.</hi> In the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect there are many who by a cheap and easie profession <hi>seek</hi> Heaven, but take them under the notion of <hi>Strivers (i. e.)</hi> persons heartily ingaged in Religion, and who make it their business, and so they will shrink up into a small number; and it presseth home his great business and concern upon him, <hi>Strive to enter in at the strait gate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>Gate</hi> understand whatsoever is introductive to Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Salvation. By the <hi>Epithet, strait,</hi> understand the difficulties and severities attending Religion, all that suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and self-denial which those that are bound for Heaven must count and cast upon. And by <hi>striving</hi> understand the diligent and constant use of all those means and duties, how hard, irksom, and costly soever they be. The word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> hath a deep sense and Emphasis, and imports striving even to an agony: and this duty is enforced two wayes upon him, and every man else, first by the indisputable Soveraignty of Christ from whom the command comes; and also from the deep interest and concern every Soul hath in the commanded duty. It is not only a simple compliance with the will of God, but what also involves our own Salvation and eternal Happiness in it: our great duty and our great interest are twisted together in this command; your eternal happiness depends upon the success of it. A man is not crowned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he strive <hi>lawfully, i. e.</hi> successfully and prevalently. O therefore so run, so strive, that ye may obtain. If you have any value for your Souls, if you would not be mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to Eternity, strive, strive. Believe it, you will find that the assurance of Salvation drops not down from Heaven in a night-dream, as the <hi>Turks</hi> fable their <hi>Alcoran</hi> to have done in that <hi>lailato hanzili,</hi> night of demission, as they call it; no, no, the righteous themselves are scarcely saved: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny seek, but few find; strive therefore as men and women that are heartily concerned for their own Salvation. Sit not with folded arms, like so many heaps of stupidity and sloth; whilst the door of Hope is yet open, and such a sweet voice from Heaven calls to you, saying, Strive, Souls, strive; if ever you expect to be partakers of the Blessedness that is here to be enjoyed, strive to the uttermost of your abilities and
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:63760:241"/>
opportunities. Such an Heaven is worth striving to obtain; such an Hell is worth striving to escape; such an invaluable Soul is worth striving to save.</p>
                  <p>I confess Heaven is not the purchace or reward of your striving! No Soul shall boastingly say there, Is not this the Glory which my duties and diligence purchased for me? And yet on the other side it is as true, that without striving you shall never set foot there. Say not, it depends upon the pleasure of God, and not upon your diligence; for it is his declared will and pleasure to bring men to Glory in the way, though not for the sake of their own striving: as in the works of your civil Calling, you know all the care, toil, and sweat of the Husbandman avails nothing of it self, except the Sun and Rain quicken and ripen the Fruits of the Earth; and yet no wise man will neglect plowing and harrowing, sowing and weeding, because these labours avail not without the influences of Heaven; but waits for them in the way of his duty and diligence: rational hope sets all the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work. Do they plow in hope, and sow in hope, and will not you pray in hope, and hear in hope? You that know your Souls to be hitherto strangers to Christ, and the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating work of the Spirit; how is it, that you take them not aside sometimes out of the distracting noise and hurries of the world, and thus bemoan them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O my poor, graceless, Christless, miserable Soul, how sad a case art thou in! others have, but thou never feltest the burden of sin; thousands in the World are striving and labouring, searching and praying to make their Calling and Election sure: whilst thou sittest still with folded hands in a supine regardlesness of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery that is hastening on upon thee. Canst thou endure the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring wrath of God? Canst thou dwell with everlasting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Hast thou fancied a tolerable Hell? Or is it easie to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish? Why dost thou not cast thy self at the feet of Christ, and cry as long as breath will last, Lord, pity a sinful, miserable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and self-condemning Soul? Lord, smite this rockie heart, subdue this stubborn will, heal and save an undone Soul ready to perish. The characters of death are upon it, it must be changed or condemned, and that in a little time. Bowels of pity, hear the cry of a Soul distressed, and ready to perish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And you that do not understand the case and slate your

Souls are in, you have never a Bible near you? O turn to those places, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. where you will presently find the more obvious marks and characters God hath set upon the children of perdition; and if you find not your self in that Catalogue among the unrighteous, Fornicators, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Adulterers, Effeminate, Thieves, Covetous, Drunkards, Revilers, Extortioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then turn to <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3. and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ask thy own Soul this question, Am I born again? Am I a new Creature? Or still in the same condition I was born in? What solid evidence of the new birth have I to rely upon, if I were now within a few gasps of death? Am not I the man or woman who live in the very same sins which the Word of God makes the Symptoms and Characters of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? And doth not my Conscience witness against me, that I am utterly void and destitute of all that saving Grace, and a meer stranger to the regenerating work of the Spirit, without which there can be no well-bottom'd hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And if so, are not the tokens of death upon me? Am not I a person markt out for misery? And shall I sit still in a state of so much danger, and not once strive to make an escape from the wrath to come? Is this vile body worth so much toil and labour to support and preserve it? And is not my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

O that the consideration of the wrath to come, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes all the world over preparing as fuel for it, and the door of opportunity yet held open to Souls by the hand of Grace to escape that wrath, might prevail with thy heart, Reader, to strive, and that to the uttermost, to secure thy precious Soul from the impending ruine.</p>

            <p>TIme is deservedly reckoned among the most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mercies of this life; and that which makes it so valuable, are the commodious seasons and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for Salvation which are vouchsafed to us therein.

We must spend those hours in prayer, meditation, searching our hearts, mortifying our lusts: which others do, and our flesh fain would spend in sensual pleasures and gratifications of the fleshly appetite. If ever we expect to win the Port of Glory, we must be as diligent and careful as <hi>Sea-men</hi> are to take eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gale that blows directly or obliquely, to set them forward in their Voyage.

or neglected in a day, which may be the ground-work of joy or sorrow to all Eternity. There is a nick of opportunity which gives both success and facility to the great and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affairs of the Soul, as well as body: to come before it, is to seek the bird before it be hatcht; and to come after it, is to seek it when it is fled. There is a twofold season or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Salvation:
<list>
                     <item>1. One was Christs season for the Purchace of it.</item>
                     <item>2. The other is ours for the Application of it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Christ had a season assigned him for the impetration and purchace of our Salvation; so you hear his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaking him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.8. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, In an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in tempore opportuno voluntatis, vel placito.</hi> It was the wisdom of the Lord Jesus Christ to set in with the Fathers time, to comply with his season; and it became a day of Salvation, because it was the acceptable time which Christ took for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men have their seasons and opportunities for the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Christ, and his benefits to their own Souls: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>We then as workers together with God beseech you also, that you receive not the grace of God in vain; for he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee. Behold, now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation.</hi> He exhorts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> not to dally or trifle any longer in the great concerns of their Salvation; for now, saith he, is your day. Christ had his day to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase it, and he procured a day also for you to apply it, and this is that day; you enjoy it, you live under it: that golden day is now running, O see that you frustrate not the design thereof, by receiving the Gospel-grace in vain.</p>
               <p>Now two things concur to make a fit season of Salvation to the Souls of men.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The external Means and Instruments.</item>
                  <item>2. The Agency of the Spirit internally by or with those external Means.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:63760:243"/>1. Men have then an opportunity for Salvation when God sends the means and instruments of Salvation among them. When the Gospel is powerfully preached among a people, then there is a door opened to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>When I came to Troas to preach the Gospel, a door was opened to me of the Lord.</hi> God doth as it were unlock the door of Heaven by the preaching of the Gospel; Souls have then an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to step in and be saved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet this is not a <hi>wide and effectual door,</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle phraseth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9.) till the Spirit of God joyns with, and works upon the heart by those external means and instruments. As the waters of the Pool of <hi>Bethesda</hi> had no inherent fanative virtue in themselves, unti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Angel of the Lord descended, and troubled them: but both together make a blessed season for the Souls of men, then he stands at the door and knocks by convictions and perswasions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. strives with men, as he did with the old world by the Ministry of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6.3. Now the door of opportunity is indeed opened, but this will not always last, there is a time when the Spirit ceaseth to strive, and when the door is shut, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.25.</p>
               <p>There is a season when by the fresh impression of some Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance or Providence of God, mens hearts are awakened, and their affections stirred! It is now with the Souls of men as it is with Fruit-trees in the Spring when they put forth blossoms, if they knit and set, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uit follows; if they be nipt and blasted, no fruit can be expected. For all convictions and motions of the affections are to Grace, much the same thing as blossoms are to Fruit, which are but the rudiment thereof, <hi>fructus imperfectus &amp; ordinabilis,</hi> somewhat in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it; and look as that is a critical and hazardous season to Trees, so is this to Souls. I do not say, it is in the power of any Soul to make the work of the Spirit effectual and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by adding his endeavours to the Spirits motions; for then conversion would not be the free and arbitrary act of the Spirit, as it is <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.8. neither would Souls be born of God, but of the will of man, contrary to <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.13. And yet it is not to be thought or said, that mens endeavours and strivings are altogether vain, needless, and insignificant; because, though they cannot make the grace of God effectual, his
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:63760:244"/>
Grace can make them effectual; they are our duty, and God can bless them to our great advantage. Now there are among others five remarkable essays, efforts, or strivings of a Soul under the impression and hand of the Spirit, which greatly tend to the fixing, settling, and securing of that great work upon the Soul: and it is seldom known that any Soul miscarries in whom these things are found.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Deep, serious, and fixed consideration, which lets conviction deep into the Soul, and settles it, and roots it fast in the heart: <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.59. <hi>I thought upon my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</hi> There are close and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious debates in those Souls in whom convictions prosper to full conversion: they sit alone, and think close to their great and eternal concerns: they carry their thoughts back to the evils of their life past, then smite on the thigh, and cry, <hi>What have I done?</hi> They run their thoughts forward into Eternity, and that to a great depth, and then cry, <hi>What shall I do to be saved?</hi> They deliberate and weigh in their most advised thoughts what is to be done, and that speedily for the escaping of the wrath to come: thus they fix those tender, weak, and hazardous motions, which dye away in multitudes of Souls; and in the loss of them their seasons of Salvation are also lost.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The first stirrings and motions of the Spirit upon mens hearts do then become a season of Salvation to them, when they are accompanied with spiritual, fervent, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent prayer: so it was with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9.11. <hi>Behold, he prayeth.</hi> It's a good sign when Souls get alone, and affect privacy and retirement to pour out their fears, sorrows, and requests to God. It is in the Espousals of a Soul to Christ, as it is in other Marriages; a third person may make the motion, and bring the Parties together, but they only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themselves, must conclude and agree the matter. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the first breath which the new Creature draws in, and the last (ordinarily) it breaths out in this world. This nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes and maturates those weak and tender first motions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, and brings them to some consistence and fixedness in the Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:63760:244"/>(3.) Then do those motions of the Spirit on mens hearts make a season of Salvation to them, when they remain and settle in the heart, and are in them <hi>per modum quietis,</hi> by way of rest and abode, following the man from place to place, from day to day; so that whatever unpleasing diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions the necessities and incumbrances of this world at any time give, yet still they return again upon the heart, and will not vanish, or suffer any long suspension: but in others who lose their blessed advantage and season, it's quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.23, 24. They are as one that seeth his natural face in a glass, and goeth away, and forgetteth what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of man he was: he sees some spot on his face, or disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his band, which he purposeth to correct, but one oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence or another chops in, and he forgets what he saw in the glass, and so goes all the day with his spot upon him. This was an evanid light purpose, which came to nothing for want of a present execution: just so it is with many in reference to their great concerns; but if the impression a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in its strength, if it return, and follow the Soul, and will not let it be quiet, it's like then to prosper and prove the time of Mercy indeed to such Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) An anxious solicitude and inquisitiveness about the means and ways of Salvation, speaks an effectual door of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be set open to the Souls of men, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. &amp; 16.30. <hi>Sirs, what must I do to be saved? Men and brethren, what shall we do? q. d.</hi> we are in a miserable condition. O you the Ministers of Christ instruct, counsel, and shew us what course to take. Is there no Balm in <hi>Gilead?</hi> No door of hope in this Valley of <hi>Achor?</hi> Alas! we are not able to dwell with our own fears, terrors, and presages of wrath to come. O for a Messenger, one among a thousand, to teach us the way of Salvation. Thus the Lord rivets and fixes those mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in some Souls, which vanish like a morning mist or dew in others.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) Lastly, That which secures and compleats this work, is the execution of those purposes and convictions, by falling without delay to the work of Faith and Repentance in good earnest, dallying no more with so great a concernment, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:63760:245"/>
no longer at shall I? shall I? when mean while time flies away, and opportunities are in hazard to be lost: but bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their thoughts and debates to a peremptory resolution, as the <hi>Lepers</hi> at <hi>Samaria</hi> did; and seeing themselves shut up to one only door of hope, there they resolve to take up their station, lying at the feet of Jesus Christ, and casting their poor burdened Souls upon him, whatever be the issue. When the Spirit of God ripens his first motions to this, and carries them through that critical season thus far, then there is an effectual door of opportunity opened indeed, this is an acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable time, a day of Salvation: but O how many thousands miscarry in this season, and like trees removed from one soil to another, dye in the removal.</p>
               <p>But certainly, it is the most solemn and important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of every Soul to watch upon all these seasons of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when God comes nigh to them by convictions and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Spirit, and to put the same value upon these things which they do upon their Souls, and the Salvation of them. This is the door of Hope set open, a fresh gale to carry you home to your Port of Glory. Salvation is now come nigh to your Souls; there is but a little betwixt you and Blessedness. Wise and happy is that Soul which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and improveth its season. To perswade and press men to discern and improve such seasons as these, is the principal work of the Preachers of the Gospel, and that special work to which I now address my self in the following Motives and Arguments.</p>
               <div n="1" type="argument">
                  <head>Argument I.</head>
                  <p>AND first, who that hath the free exercise of Reason, and the sense of a future eternal Estate, would care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly neglect any season of Salvation, whilst he seeth all the rational world so carefully attending and watching all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to promote and secure their lower concerns and designs for the present life?</p>
                  <p>Is not the saving of a mans Soul as weighty a concern as the getting of an Estate? You cannot but observe how care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Merchants are to nick the opportunity which promiseth
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:63760:245"/>
them a good turn. How yare poor Sea-men look out for a wind to wast them to their Port, and industriously shift their Sails to improve every slaw that may set them on in their Voyage. How many miles Tradesmen will travel to be in season at a Fayr, to put off or purchase Goods to their advantage. No entertainments, recreations, or importunities of friends can prevail with any of these to lose a day on which their business depends: all things must give way to their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness: they all understand their seasons, and will not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. But alas, what childish toyes are all these, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Salvation! What is the loss of a little Money, to the loss of a mans Soul? If a mans life depended upon his being at such a place, by such a precise hour, sure he would not over-sleep his time that morning; and had he but the least fear of coming too late, every stroke of the Clock would strike to his heart: and yet remisness and carelesness in such a case as this, is infinitely more excusable than in the matter of Salvation. Certainly the solicitude and care of all the world for the interests thereof, yea, your own diligence and circumspection in temporal things will be an uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and confounding self-conviction to you in the day of your account, and leave you without Plea or Apology for your supine neglects of the seasons of Salvation.</p>

of time, though it be more worth than all the other greater parts and portions of your time; yet it is as much <hi>in fluxu,</hi> in hasty motion and expence as other parts of time are: and being once lost, is never more to be recalled or recovered. Few men know or understand it whilst it is current: other seasons for natural or civil actions are known and stated, but the time of Grace is not so easily discerned, and therefore commonly mistaken and lost: and this comes to pass partly through

                  <p n="2">2. Discouraging Fears put it too far back, and represent it as long since past and gone, whilst it is yet in being, and in our hands. By such pangs of desperation Satan cuts the very nerves of industry and diligence, and causes Souls to yield themselves as by consent for lost and hopeless, even whilst the Gospel is opening their eyes to see their sin and misery, which is a part of the work in order to their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Thus the eyes of thousands are dazled, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discern the season of Mercy, and so it slides from them, as if it had never been.</p>
                  <p>God came near them in the means of their Conversion, yea, and nearer than that, in the motions of his Spirit upon their Consciences and Affections; but they knew not the time of their visitation, and now the things of their peace are hidden from their eyes. Had those Convictions been obeyed, and those purposes that were begotten in their hearts been followed home by answerable executions of them, happy had they been to all Eternity: but their careless neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects have quenched them, and the door is shut, and who knows whether it may be opened any more? O dally not with the Spirit of God, resist not his calls, his motions upon the Soul are tender things, they may soon be quenched, and never recovered.</p>

                  <p>NEglect not the seasons of Mercy, the day of Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause opportunity facilitates the great work of your Salvation: it is much easier to be done in such a season, than it can be afterwards: an impression is easily made upon wax when it is melted, but stay a while till it be hardned, and if you lay the greatest weight upon the seal, it leaves not its impress upon it. Much so it is with the heart, there is a season when God makes it soft and yielding, when the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are thawed and melted under the Word. Conscience is full of sense and activity, the will pliable: now is the time to set in with the motions of the Spirit: there is now a gale from Heaven, if you will take it; and if not, it tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men. Neglect of the season is the loss of the Soul. The heart, like melted wax, will naturally harden again, and then to how little purpose are your own feeble essays? <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.15. 'tis both easie and successful striving, when the Spirit of God strives in you and with you; you are now workers together with God, and such work goes on smoothly and sweetly: that which is in motion is easily moved; but if once the heart be set, you may tug to little purpose.</p>

                  <head>Argument IV.</head>
                  <p>THE infinite importance and weight of Salvation is alone instead of all motives and arguments to make men prize and improve every proper season for it. It is no ordinary concern, it is your life, yea, it is your eternal life. The solemnity and awfulness of such a business as this, is enough to swallow up the spirit of a man. O what an awful found have such words as these, <hi>Ever with the Lord!</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you saw the Glory of Heaven, the full reward of all the labours and sufferings of the Saints, the blessed harvest of all their prayers, tears, diligence, and self-denial in this world; or suppose you had a true representation of the Torments of
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:63760:247"/>
Hell, and could but hear the wailings of the damned for the neglect of the season of Mercy, and their passionate, but vain wishes for one of those days which they have lost; would you think any care, any pains, any self-denial too much to save and redeem one of these opportunities? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you would have a far higher estimation of them than ever you had in your lives.</p>
                  <p>A Tryal for a mans whole Estate is accounted a solemn business among men, the Cast of a <hi>Dye</hi> for a mans life is a weighty action, and seldom done without anxiety of the mind, and trembling of the hand: yet both these are but Childrens Play compared with Salvation-work.</p>
                  <p>Three things put an unspeakable solemnity upon this matter: it is the <hi>precious Soul,</hi> which is above all valuation that lies at stake, and is to be saved or lost. The saving or losing of it is not for a time, but <hi>for ever,</hi> and this is the <hi>only season</hi> in which it will be eternally saved, or cast away: all hangs upon a little inch of time, which being over-slipt and lost, is never more to be recalled or recovered. Lord, with what serious spirits, deep and weighty consideration, fears and tremblings of heart should men and women attend the seasons of their Salvation!</p>
                  <p>Believe it, Reader, since thy Soul projected its first thought, there never was a more weighty and concerning subject than this presented to thy thoughts. O therefore let not thy thoughts trifle about it, and slide from it as they use to do in other things of common concernment.</p>

                  <p>IF we set any value upon the true pleasure of life, or solid comfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of our Souls at death, let us by no means neglect the special seasons and opportunities of Salvation we now enjoy.</p>
                  <p>These two things, the <hi>pleasure of life,</hi> and <hi>comfort in death</hi> should be prized by every man more than his two eyes: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no Being at all is more desirable than a Being without these: take away the true spiritual pleasure of life, and you level the life of man with the beast that perisheth: and take
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:63760:247"/>
away the hope and comfort of the Soul in death, and you sink him infinitely below the beast, and make him a Being only capable of misery for ever.</p>
                  <p>Now there can be no true spiritual pleasure found in that Soul that hath neglected and lost his only season of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: all the solid delight and comfort of life results from the settlement and security of a mans great concern in the proper season thereof. The true mirth of the converted <hi>Prodigal</hi> bears date from the time of his return and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation to his Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.24. Two things are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely prerequisite to the comfort of life, <hi>viz.</hi> a change of the state by Justification, and a change of the frame and temper of the heart by Sanctification. To be in a pardoned state is matter of all joy, <hi>Matt.</hi> 9.2. and to be spiritually minded is life and peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. no good news comes to any man before this, and no bad news can sink a mans heart after this.</p>
                  <p>And for hope and comfort in death, let none be so fond to expect it, till his Soul have first complied with, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Call of God in the time thereof; a careless life never did nor ever will produce a comfortable death. What is more common among all that dye not stupid and sensless, as well as unregenerate and Christless, than the bitter dolorous complaints of their mis-spent time, and losing their season of Mercy? Reader, if thou wouldst not feel that anguish thou hast seen and heard others to be in upon this account, know the time of thy visitation, and finish thy great work whilst it is day.</p>

            <p>I shall close all with a word of Exhortation, perswading (if it be possible) the careless and unthinking Neglecters of their precious Time and Souls, to awaken out of that deep and dangerous security in which they lye fast asleep upon the very brink of Eternity: and to day, whilst it is yet called to day, to hear the Voice of God calling them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith, and thereby to Christ and everlasting Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness. <hi>Behold, he yet standeth at the door and knocks,</hi> Rev. 3.20. the door of Hope is not yet finally shut, there are yet some stirrings at certain times in mens Consciences; God comes near them in his Word, and in some rouzing acts of Providence, the death of a near Relation, the seizure of a dangerous Disease, the blasting and disappointment of a mans great Design and Project for this World, a fall into some notorious Sin; these and many such like Methods of Providence, as well as the convincing voice of the Word, have the efficacy of an awaking voice to mens drowsie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; and if careless Sinners would but attend to them, and follow home those motions they make upon their hearts, who knows to what these weak beginnings might arise and prosper. The Souls of men are as it were imbarked in the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:63760:248"/>
Calls of God, your life is bound up in them; if these be lost, your Souls are lost; if these abide upon you, and grow up to sound Conversion, you are saved by them. More particularly consider,
<list>
                  <item>(1.) What a mercy it is to have your Lot providentially cast under the Gospel? To be born under and bred up with the means and instruments of Conversion and Salvation? We have lived from our youth up under the Calls of God, and within the joyful sound of the Gospel: <hi>God hath not dealt so with other Nations,</hi> Psal. 147.20. Though others should seek the means of life, they cannot find them; and though you seek them not, you can hardly miss them.</item>
                  <item>(2.) How great a mercy is it to have your lives lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out hitherto by the patience of God under the Gospel? That neither that golden Lamp, nor the Lamp of your life (both which are liable to be extinguished every moment) are yet put out. Thousands and ten thousands your Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries are gone out of the hearing of the voice of the Gospel, they shall never hear another Call, the Treaty of God is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, the Master of the house is risen up, and the doors are shut: Your neglects and provocations have not been inferiour to theirs, but the patience and goodness of God hath exceeded and abounded to you beyond whatever it did to them.</item>
                  <item>(3.) Bethink your selves what an aggravation of your misery it will be to sink into Hell with the Calls of God sounding in your ears! to sink into eternal misery betwixt the tender out-stretched arms of Mercy; this is the Hell of Hell, the Emphasis of Damnation; the racking Engine on which the Consciences of the damned are tortured. <hi>And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to hell,</hi> Matt. 11.23. Such a fall after so high an exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is the very <hi>Strappado</hi> which will torment your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Hell will prove a cooler and milder place to the Heathens that never enjoyed your light, means, and mercies in this world, than it will to you. None sink so deep into misery in the world to come, as they that fall from the fairest opportunities of Salvation in this world.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="464" facs="tcp:63760:249"/>(4) Let no man expect that God will hear his cryes and intreaties in time of misery, who neglects and slights the Calls of God in the time of Mercy. God calls, but men will not hear, the day is coming when they shall cry, but God will not hear, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 25 will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? <hi>Iob</hi> 27.9. no, no, he will not: and this is but a just retribution from the righteous God, whose calls and counsels men have set at nought; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men now think of it, it is certainly the greatest misery incident to man in all the world: for as no words can make another fully sensible what a priviledge it is to have the ear, favour, pity, and help of God in a day of straits; so it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for any words to express the doleful state and case of that Soul whom God casts off in trouble, and whose cryes he shuts out.</item>
                  <item>(5) Beware of neglecting any Call of God, because that Call you are now tempted to neglect, may be the last Call that ever God intendeth to give thy Soul. Sure I am there is a Call which will be the last Call of God to rebellious Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and after that no more Calls, but an eternal deep silence: his Spirit shall not always strive with man; and the more motions and calls you have already slighted, the more probable it is, that this may be the last Voice of God in a way of Mercy to thy Soul: and what if after this, God should seal up thy heart, and judicially harden it; make thy will ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inflexible, and thine ears deaf, as he threatens, <hi>Isa</hi> 6.10. What an undone miserable man or woman art thou then! O beware of provoking the forest of all Judgments, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting any longer in a course of rebellion against Light and Mercy.</item>
                  <item>(6) Whilst your hearts put off and neglect the Calls of God, you can never by any means arrive to the evidence and assurance of your Election; for your Election is only secured to you by your effectual calling, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. there is no way for men to discern their Names written in the Book of Life, but by reading the work of Sanctification in their own hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. I desire no miraculous Voice from Heaven, no
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:63760:249"/>
extraordinary signs or unscriptural notices and informations in this matter, Lord, let me but find my heart complying with thy calls, my will obediently submitting to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; Sin my burden, and Christ my desire: I will never crave a fairer or surer evidence of thy electing love to my Soul; and if I had an <hi>Oracle</hi> from Heaven, an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Messenger from the other World, to tell me thou lovest me, I have no reason to give credit to such a Voice, whilst I find my heart wholly sensual, averse to God, and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to all that is spiritual.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p n="7">(7.) What reason have you why you should not presently embrace the Call of God, and thankfully lay hold upon the first opportunity and season of Salvation?</p>
                     <p>Have you any greater matters in hand than the Salvation of your precious Souls? Is there any thing in all this world that more concerns you? If the affairs of this life be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably necessary, and those of the world to come so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: if you think that meat and drink, trade and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, wife and children be such great things, and Christ, Soul, and Eternity such little things; or if you think the Salvation be a work of the greatest necessity, yet it may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough be put off to a time of uncertainty, I may assure you, you will not long be of this mind. How soon are all the mistakes of men in these matters rectified in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after death? Rectified, I say, but not remedied; your opinion will be changed, but not your condition.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>(8.) Do you not every day easily and readily obey the Calls of Satan and your own Lusts, whilst God and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science are suffered to call and strive with you in vain? If Satan or your Lusts call you to the <hi>Tavern,</hi> to the World, and your sinful Pleasures, you speedily comply with their Call, and yield a ready obedience: if Pride call, if Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness call, if Passion and Revenge call, they need not call twice; and shall God call, and Conscience call only in vain? Lord, what a Creature is Man become! If a vain Companion call, you have no power to deny him; if God call, you have no ear to hear him.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="466" facs="tcp:63760:250"/>(9.) You cannot but observe the obedience and diligence of many others, how seriously, painfully, and assiduously they ply and follow on the work of their own Salvation, and yet they are no more concerned in the events and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of these things than you are. Doth it not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you when you compare your selves with them? Do not such thoughts as these sometimes arise in your hearts upon such observations? Lord, what a difference is there like to be betwixt their end and mine, when there is so apparent a difference in our course and conversation? Doth not God distinguish persons in this world by the frames of their hearts and tenor of their lives, in order to the great distinction he will make betwixt one and another in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Have not I as precious a Soul to save, or lose, as any of them? What is the matter that I sit with folded arms, whilst they are working out Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling? Why should any man or woman in the world be more careful for their Souls, than I for mine? Surely its capacity and excellency is equal with theirs, though our care and diligence be so unequal.</item>
                  <item>(10.) To conclude, God will shortly give you an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible Call to the Grave, and after that his Voice shall call to you in your Graves, <hi>Arise ye dead, and come to Iudgment:</hi> but wo be to you, wo and alas that ever you were born, if you should hear the Call of God to dye, before you have heard and obeyed his Call to Christ. Will your Death-bed be easie to you? Can you with any hope or comfort shoot the Gulph of Eternity, before you have done one act for the securing your Souls from the wrath to come? 'Tis a dreadful thing for a poor Christless Soul to sit quivering up on the lips of a dying Sinner, not able to stay, nor yet to endure a parting pull from the Body in such a case as it is.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, if the <hi>God</hi> that made, and will shortly judge you; if the <hi>Redeemer</hi> that shed his invaluable Blood, and now offers you the purchaces and benefits of it; if you have any love to, or care of your <hi>own Souls,</hi> which are more worth than the whole world; if you have any value for <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> or dread of <hi>Hell,</hi> then for Gods sake, for Christs sake,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:63760:250"/>
for your precious Souls sake, trifle with Heaven and Hell no longer, but be in earnest to work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling. Could I think of any other means or motives that might secure your Souls from danger, I would surely use them. Could I reach your hearts effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, I would deeply impress this great concern upon them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
