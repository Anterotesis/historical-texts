         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

maner of dealynge, wherewith he was
intreated by them nat long ago, when
through theyr taken on authoritie they

That fyrſt of all, they muſt begyn with

For euerye man ſawe three mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes

which thing peaſably endured tyll
the commyng of the ſayd Duke of Guiſe
to Paris. Wheruppon it is good is
marke that when towards the ende, the

made ſtronger with certayne horſemen
and footemen, to lette ſuch metinges as
men ſawe were appointed purpoſelye to

notwithſtanding ſince the commyng of

and it hath been ſo hard a matter to kepe

makyng the Queene priuie therto,
yea and agaynſte her pleaſure alſo.
Laſtly the ſayd Prince knoweth it to be
the woorke of God, that the ſayd Duke
of Guiſe and Conſtable, haue nat bene
able in publike and in ſo great a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to diſſemble their meanyng, and that
they haue no more ſaid than they thinke

ſuche talke as is ordinarie among
their familiers and houſehold ſeruants,
whiche alſo hathe been well knowen by
an infinite numbre of letters taken vp

more than to diſſolue the companye at
Orleance, as they may afterwarde doo
execution as well on the greate as the

meanyng. Whervppon they make of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes

as of late hath ben exerciſed in Parys as

the faulte can not bee imputed to other

that meſſage, whych the Queene
ſent vnto the ſaid Prince, to wete: That
he ſhoulde vnarme hymſelfe vppon her

come to the courte, where he ſhoulde be

by wrytynge, make hym all ſuche aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

vnderſtandeth, that thoſe diſpatches and

that her maieſtie (howe good wil ſoeuer
ſhe haue) can make hym any ſuretie, ſo
long as ſhe remaineth in their powers,
and whyle they ſhall abyde aboute the

to reſiſt them, or any enterpriſe they ſhal
attempt, being enuironned with theyr
force and armour which thei themſelues
haue leuied and aſſembled, and whiche
they haue preſumed to brynge into the

ſuretie is it alſo to ſaye, the kyng of
Nauarre (whom the ſayd Prince and al

haue the force of the Kynges Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
generall, if a man marke theyr en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
of poſſeſſyng hym, and the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng

to be douted, but that the force and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which they haue aſſembled (in whoſe
hande ſo euer they ſhall come) wyll bee
at their deuotion, and wyll bee obedient
<pb facs="tcp:8172:10"/>
to their willes and intentes. Whereby
they ſhall alwais be able to ſerue theim

they had power, authoritie and mean to
hurt within their rule (wherof if it wold
pleaſe them but a little to thinke on) thei
ſhuld finde that thonly goodnes of God
hath hitherto preſerued theim. To bee

They make no difficultie in cauſyng the

out and deſtroyeng of the more parte of
his nobilitie and all other eſtates, which
is, as though a manne would cutt of his
own armes and legges, and wold make
an ende of the ruinyng of this realme,
which by their goodly councell, conduict
and gouernment, is brought to the ſtate
that all menne ſee. Finally, theſe wiſe
heades of this realme care not to laye
out this land to the pray, deuiſyng with
them ſelues how to bryng in ſtrangers,
and to withdrawe the bandes and moſte
notable ſouldiours frome the places of

            <p>As touching the perſuaſion vſed to the

to giue ſuretie to thoſe that haue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Nay they haue ben ſo loftie as thei
haue not let to ſay, that the kyng in his
vnder age had none authoritie to cauſe
them to depart as though the quene did
not ſupplie the tender age of the kyng:
yea and haue thoughte it more mete by
reaſon of their callyngs to tarie ſtyll at
the court to diſobey and trouble the ſtate
than by their departynge to leaue good
example, to geue authoritie vnto the
kynges commaundemente, and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe

wherin they lack all good and iuſt grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

preſuming more than at any time durſte
any of the propre brethern of any of our

Now foraſmuch as thorow their arriual
and preſence at the court together, with
their goodly behauior, they ſe they haue
made ſuche a ſtirre as thereby they haue
ſet all Fraunce in trouble and fyer, and
haue moued a Ciuile warre, and that

nor for the libertie of the kyng and

reſolued neuer to commytte hymſelfe to

At the leaſte if againſt all reaſon and

thoſe at the court, which are but offcers
of the croune withall the force they haue
aſſembled of their owne priuate authori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie:
They canne not then deny, but that

with all their power, for whoſe ſeruyce

But if it happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aboueſaid wil not

reſpect theſe perſons haue towards her,
whiche at this time make their councels

her to ſet forth thoſe thinges themſelues
haue agreed on: they ſend out the diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb facs="tcp:8172:15"/>
and after tell her the matter: they
force the courte of parliament to paſſe at
their pleaſure, whatſoeuer they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
and what ſo ſeemeth good to them
manifeſtly ſhewyng to haue more credit
and authoritie therin than euer the king
and quene could haue. To be ſhort, who
is he that wyll not thinke it at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
more than meete, that the ſayd lady
ſhold take vpon her again her authoritie
without beyng any longer thus compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with theſe men of warr, and that the
aboue named doe withdraw themſelues
with all their force, for the remeuyng of
that feare and ſuſpicion that they haue
(not without occaſion) geuen to ſo many
and withall to remedye thoſe miſeries,
wherewith this ſtate is threatened: and
this the rather becauſe the ſaid prince be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng
aſſured of his companye, who be of
the beſt ſeruaunts of this croune, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
with hym of all other eſtates, are
determined once for all, to prooue theyr

vnto, who haue abuſed the ſame
afore time with ſo great loſſe of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

ſuch boucheries and oultrages agaynſte
thoſe of that religion, which the Prince
is of, wythout any regarde hadde to the

be wel ware while he liueth how he ſhal
commit hym ſelfe to their mercy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

            <p>And for the remeuing of all ſuch ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders

cauſe to be made agaynſt the ſaid prynce
(chiefly this which they greatly ſett for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
that he and thoſe of his company

from the beginning expreſſly forbidden
any man to lay handes on the kings, the

True it is that the ſame hathe not

particulers whiche haue both ben ſtaied
