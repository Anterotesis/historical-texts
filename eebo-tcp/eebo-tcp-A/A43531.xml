            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Generall PREFACE
to the Whole.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is affirmed of History by the famous
Orator, that it is <hi>Testis temporum,</hi> the
Witnesse and Record of time, by
which the actions of it are transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from one age to another. And
therefore it concerns all those who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themselves to the writing of Histories, to take
speciall care that all things be laid down exactly,
faithfully, and without deviation from the truth in
the least particular. For if the Witnesses be subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the Record falsified, or the Evidence wrested,
neither Posterity can judge rightly of the actions of
this present time, or this time give a certain judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Ages past. It is therefore a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
which <hi>Iosephus</hi> the Historian gives us, and
which he followed as it seems in his <hi>Iewish Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
not only to be carefull that the stile be pleasing,
but that the whole Work be framed by the Levell
and Line of Truth. <hi>Nam qui Historiam &amp; rerum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
<pb facs="tcp:61619:3"/>
Antiquitatem obscurarum expositionem,</hi> &amp;c.<q> They
(saith he) who make profession to write Histories,
and to recite such things as are obscured by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
ought not only studiously to conform their
stile, but also to beautifie the same with ornaments
of Eloquence, to the intent the Reader may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
in their Writings with the more delectation.
But above all things they must have an
especiall care <hi>so exactly to set down the
truth,</hi>
               </q>
               <note place="margin">Antiq. Iad. Lib. 14. cap 1.</note> that they who know not how those things
came to passe may be the more duely and fitly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
There is another Rule, which he bound
himself to. that is to say, <hi>Neither to omit any thing
through ign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rance, nor to bury any thing in forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi>
and all these cautions well observed make a

                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct History. But on the contrary, there are some
who do spend themselves on the stile and dresse, as
if their businesse rather were to delight the ear then
inform the judgement; Others so byassed by self-ends
and private interesse, that they seem rather
Advocates to pleade for some growing party, then
true Reporters of affairs as they be before them.
Some who endeavouring to be copious, clap all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in a huddle which is offered to them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
relation to the Ornaments and Attire of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
and others with like carelesnesse as unto
themselves, but greater inconvenience as unto the
Reader, examine not the truth and certainty of
what they write, so they write somewhat which they
think may inform the Reader. Betwixt these truth
is oftentimes irrecoverably lost, the Reader led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
from the waies of Verity into the crooked lanes
<pb facs="tcp:61619:3"/>
of Errour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many times conducted to such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<hi>praecipices</hi> as ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> prove destructive to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and of ill consequence to all those which are
guided by him. The errours of the understanding
in matters which may possibly be reduced to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
are far more mischievous then those which
do consist in the niceties of speculation, and advance
no further, which moved the Orator not only to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
History with the Attribute of <hi>Testis temporum,</hi>
but to stile it also by the name of <hi>Magistra vitae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things considered as they ought, have made
me wonder many times at the unadvisednesse of
some Late Writers in this kinde, whose Histories
are composed with so much partiality on the one
side, and so much inadvertency on the other, that
they stand more in need of a <hi>Commentator</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the Truth, and lay it clear and open to the
view of the Reader, then either the dark words of
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> or any other obscure peece of the ancient
Writers. I speak of Histories here, not <hi>Libels,</hi> of
which last sort I reckon <hi>Weldons</hi> Pamphlet, called,
<hi>The Court of King</hi> James, and <hi>Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>famous
Pasquill of the Reign of that King; in which it is
not easie to judge whether the matter be more false
or the stile more reproachfull in all parts thereof.
Certain I am we may affirm of them,<note place="margin">Tacit. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. lib, 4.</note> as
<hi>Cremutius Cordus</hi> doth of the Epistles of
<hi>Antonius,</hi> and the Orations of <hi>Brutus, falsa quidem in
Augustum probra, se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> multa cum acerbitate habent,</hi> that
is to say, that they contained not only many false
and disgracefull passages against the honour of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>
but were apparelled in all the bitternesse of a
<pb facs="tcp:61619:4"/>
scurrilous language. With such as these I shall not
meddle at the present, leaving their crimes unto the
punishment not of an <hi>Index,</hi> but an <hi>Ignis expurgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
as most proper for them. But as for those
whom either the want of true intelligence or inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency
in not weighing seriously what they were
to do, or the too much indulgence to their own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
have made more capable of being bettered
by correction, I have thought it more agreeable to
the Rules of justice, to rectifie their mistakes, and
reform their Errours, then absolutely to condemn
and decry their Writings. At this time I have two
before me whom I conceive to stand in need of such
Observations, by which the truth may be preserved,
and the clear face of things presented to the Readers
eye; the one of them an Authour of <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi>
the other of some <hi>Civil</hi> Histories. In both I finde
the Truth much injured, and in one the Church.
The Errours of the one tend not to the subversion
of any publick interesse, but, being Errours, may
misguide the Reader in the way of his knowledge and
discourse, and therefore I have rectified him with
some Advertisements (not taking notice of such
passages as have been made the subject of some <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations</hi>
from another hand) that so he may be
read with the greatest profit. The other (besides
errours of this kinde too many) hath intermingled
his Discourse with some Positions of a dangerous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which being reduced into practise, as they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
may not only overthrow the whole power of
the Church as it stands constituted and established
by the Laws of the Land, but lay a probable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb facs="tcp:61619:4"/>
for the like disturbances in the <hi>Civil State.</hi>
And therefore I have fitted him with some Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
in the way of an <hi>Antidote,</hi> that so he may
be read, if possible, without any danger.</p>
            <p>I know well how invidious a task I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and that it will be charged upon me at the first
apprehensions of it, that I have rather chosen to
finde fault with the Writings of others, then to
write any things of this kinde which may be subject
to the like partialities and mistakings. <hi>Carpere vel
noli nostra, vel ede tua,</hi> might come in seasonably
here, if I had not somewhat to alledge for my
justification. But when the Reasons which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
me to the first Adventure (mentioned in the
Introduction following) be seriously considered,
as they ought to be; I hope I shall be capable of
excuse at the least, if not of pardon. And for my
venturing on the other, I shall say nothing more
at the present, but that as well my love to Truth
as to doe right unto the Authour (whom I would
willingly look on as a man well principled, and of
no ill affections to Church or State) hath invited
me to it. Truth is the Mistresse which I serve,
and I presume that none will be offended with me
because I tell them of their Errours in a modest
way, and beare witnesse for them to that Truth
of which they doe professe themselves such espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Lovers. In that great <hi>Disputation</hi> between
the Esquires of the body of King <hi>Darius,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King, Wine, Women, or the Truth
were of greatest power,<note place="margin">1 Esdr. cap. 4. ver. 41.</note> the whole
Assembly cryed out in behalf of Truth,
<pb facs="tcp:61619:5"/>
               <hi>Magna est Veritas, &amp; praevalet,</hi> that is to say,
Great is Truth, and mighty above all things. So
that in standing for the Truth, without conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
unto the recompence of reward, I hope,
though I mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> some Adversaries, I shall finde more
Friends: If not (for I am at a reasonable passe
for that) it shall be no small comfort to me that
the weak Candle of my Studies hath given light
to oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs, whereby they may discern some Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hs even in the darkest Mists of Errour,
which either partiality or incogitancy hath cast
before the eyes of unwary Readers. Which
said, I shall now adde no more, but that having
two P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tients under cure of different tempers, it is
not to be thought that I should administer unto
both the same kinde of Physick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an ordinary purge
being sufficient for the one, whereas the foule
body of the other doth require a <hi>Fluxing;</hi> as some
wounds may be healed with Balm, when others

                        </gap>story of Britain,</hi> for Vindication
of the Truth, the Church, and the injured
Clergy, I have thought good to prepare the
way unto them by a plain, but <hi>necessary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction,</hi>
touching the Quality and Nature of the Book
which I have in hand. Concerning which the Reader is to
understand that in the Year 1642. M. <hi>Fuller</hi> publisht his
Book called <hi>The Holy State,</hi> in the Preface whereof he lets
us know, that he should <hi>count it freedom to serve two Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiships
(God spinning out the thick thread of his life so
<pb facs="tcp:61619:8"/>
long) in writing the Ecclesiasticall History from Christs time
to our daies.</hi> And so much time it seems he had spent upon
it (except some starts for recreation in the <hi>Holy Land</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had finisht and expos'd it to the publike view; the
Book not coming out until the Year 1655. whether agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his promise and such a tedious expectation, we are
now to see.</p>
                  <p>For first, The Reader might expect by the former pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
that he designed the <hi>Generall History</hi> of the Church,
from the first preaching of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the calling of the
twelve <hi>Apostles</hi> to the times we live in: whereas he hath
restrained himself to the Church of <hi>Britain,</hi> which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
to be so far from being founded in the time of <hi>Christ,</hi>
that he is loth to give it the Antiquity of being the work
of any of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> of any of the <hi>Seventy Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
or finally of any <hi>Apostolicall</hi> Spirit of those eldest
times.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, Though he entitle it by the name of the
<hi>Church-History of Britain,</hi> yet he pursues not his Designe
agreeable to that Title neither: there being little said of the
affairs of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which certainly makes
up a considerable part of the Isle of <hi>Britain,</hi> and lesse (if
any thing at all) of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
past in the account of a <hi>British Island.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is it thirdly, a <hi>Church-History</hi> rightly and properly
so called, but an aggregation of such and so many <hi>Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous</hi>
bodies, that <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> affairs make the least part
of it. Abstracted from the dresse and trimming, and all
those outward imbelishments which appear upon it, it hath
a very fit resemblance to that <hi>Lady of pleasure</hi> of which
<hi>Martial</hi> tels us, <hi>Pars minima est ipsa puella sui,</hi> that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was the least part of her self. The name of a <hi>Church-Rhapsody</hi>
had been fitter for it, though to say truth (had it
been answerable thereunto in point of learning) it might
have past by the old Title of <hi>Fullers Miscellanies.</hi> For such
and so many are the impertinencies, as to matters of <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:61619:8"/>
nature, more as to matters of the Church, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them this great Volume had been brought to a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
compasse, if it had taken up any room at all. So that we
may affirm of the present History as one did of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>Chrisippus</hi> an old Philosopher,<note place="margin">

is to say, that if they were well purged of all such passages
as were not pertinent to the businesse which he had in hand,
there would be nothing left in them to fill up his Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>2. The first of this kinde which I am to note, is a meer
<hi>extrinsecall</hi> and outside unto those impertinences which are
coucht within; consisting of <hi>Title-Pages, Dedicatory Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
and severall intermediate <hi>Inscriptions</hi> unto every Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
A new way, never travelled before by any, till he
found it out, &amp; such wherein he is not like to finde many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
though the way be opened. I know it is no unusu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
thing for works of different Arguments, publisht at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
times, and dedicated to severall persons, to be drawn
together into one Volume; and being so drawn together,
to retain still those particular <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Dedications</hi> which
at first they had. But I dare confidently say, that our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
is the first who writing a Book of the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not published by peece-meal, as it came from his
hand, but in a full and intire Volume, hath filled his Sheets
with so many <hi>Title-leaves</hi> and <hi>Dedications,</hi> as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us. For in this one Book, taking in the History of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
which is but an Appendix to it, there are no fewer
then 12 particular Titles, beside the generall; as many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Dedications, and no fewer then fifty eight or sixty of
those By-Inscriptions which are addrest to his particular
Friends and Benefactors, which make it bigger by fourty
Sheets at the least, then it had been otherwise. Nay, so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
he is of encreasing the Number of his Patrons, that
having but four Leaves to come to the end of his History,
<pb facs="tcp:61619:9"/>
he findes out a particular <hi>Benefactress</hi> to inscribe it to:
Which brings into my minde the vanity of <hi>Vitellius</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing,
and of <hi>Roscius Regulus</hi> for accepting the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sular
Dignity, for that part of the day on which <hi>Cecina,</hi> by
Order and Decree of the Senate, was degraded from it: Of
which the Historian gives this Note, that it was, <hi>Magno cum
irrisu accipientis tribuentisque,</hi> a matter of no mean disport
amongst the People for a long time after: But of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
our Author heard so much at the late Act in <hi>Oxford,</hi>
that I shall say no more of it at this present time.</p>
                  <p>3. In the next ranck of Impertinencies, which are more
<hi>intrinsecal,</hi> part of the substance of the work, I account his
<hi>Heraldry, Blazons</hi> of Arms, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their Atchievements intermingled as they come in his way,
not pertinent, I am sure, to a <hi>Church-H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>storian,</hi> unless such
persons had been Founders of <hi>Episcopal Sees,</hi> or <hi>Religious
Houses,</hi> or that the Arms so <hi>blazoned</hi> did belong to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Our Author tells us, <hi>lib. 5. fol.</hi> 191. that knowledge in
the Laws of this Land, <hi>is neither to be expected or required in
one of</hi> his <hi>profession;</hi> and yet I trow, considering the great
influence which the Laws have upon Church-matters, the
knowledge of the Law cannot be so unnecessary in the way
of a Clergy-man, as the study of <hi>Heraldry:</hi> But granting
<hi>Heraldry</hi> to be an Ornament in all them that have it, yet is it
no ingredient requisite to the composition of an <hi>Ecclesiastical
History: The Copies of Battle-Abbey Roll</hi> fitter for <hi>Stow</hi> and
<hi>Hollingshe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d,</hi> where before we had them, can, in an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Church, pretend to no place at all, though possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the names of some may be remembred as their Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Endowments of Churches give occasion for it. The
Arms of the <hi>Knights-Errant,</hi> billeted in the Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueror, is of like extravagancy. Such also
is the Catalogue of those noble Adventurers, (with their
Arms, Issue and Atchievements) who did accompany King
<hi>Richard</hi> the first to the War of <hi>Palestine,</hi> which might have
<pb facs="tcp:61619:9"/>

                     </hi>
then found a place in the main Body of an History of the
<hi>Church of England:</hi> Which three alone, besides many <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercalatious</hi>
of that kinde, in most parts of the Book, make
up eight sheets more, inserted onely for the ostentation of
his skill in <hi>Heraldry,</hi> in which notwithstanding he hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
on as palpable Errors, as he hath committed in his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
For besides those which are observed in the course of
this work, I finde two others of that kinde in his History of
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> to be noted here.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>fol.</hi> 146. he telleth us, That <hi>Alice Countess of Oxford
was Daughter and sole Heir of</hi> Gilbert <hi>Lord</hi> Samford, <hi>which</hi>
Gilbert <hi>was Hereditary Lord Chamberlain of England:</hi> But
by his leave, <hi>Gilbert</hi> Lord <hi>Samford</hi> was never the Heriditary
Chamberlain of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> but onely Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain
in Fee to the Queens of <hi>England,</hi> betwixt which
Offices how vast a difference there is, let our Authour
judge.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, The Honor of Lord Chamberlain of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
came not unto the Earls of <hi>Oxford</hi> by that Marriage,
or by any other, but was invested in that Family, before they
had attained the Title and Degree of Earls: Conferred by
King <hi>Henry</hi> the first on <hi>Aubrey de Vere,</hi> a right
puissant Person, and afterwards on <hi>Aubrey de
Vere</hi> his Son, together with the Earldom of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cambd. in Oxf. fol. 389.</note>
by King <hi>Henry</hi> the second; continuing
Hereditary in that House, till the death of <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> the ninth Earl thereof, and then bestowed for a
time at the Kings discretion, and at last setled by King <hi>Charls</hi>
in the House of <hi>Lindsey.</hi> But because being a <hi>Cambridge</hi>
Man, he may be better skild in the Earls of that County, let
as see what he saith of them; and we shall finde, <hi>fol.</hi> 162.
That <hi>Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, was the eighth Earl
of Cambridge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas first, <hi>Richard Duke of York</hi> was not Earl of
<hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:61619:10"/>
And secondly, If he had been such, he must have been
the seventh Earl, and not the eighth: For thus those Earls
are marshalled in our <hi>Catalogues of Honor,</hi> and <hi>Books of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldry,
viz. 1. William de Meschines. 2. Iohn de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

3. William Marquess of Iuliers. 4. Edmond of Langley, D.
of York. 5. Edward D. of York. 6. Richard de Conisburgh,
yonger Brother of Edward. 7. Iames Marquess Hamilton,
&amp;c.</hi> No <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> to be found amongst them,
his Father, <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Konisburgh,</hi> having lost that Title
by Attainder, which never was restored to <hi>Richard</hi> his Son
(though most improvidently advanced to the Dukedom of
<hi>York</hi>) nor unto any other of that Line and Family.</p>
                  <p>4. Proceed we in the next place to Verses, and old ends of
Poetry, scattered and dispersed in all parts of the History,

verses on the Martyrdom of Arch Bishop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi>

Let me, (saith he, I beseech you) insert these following
verses, though otherwise against the Rule and Laws of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But what alass! were eighteen or twenty verses com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb facs="tcp:61619:10"/>
with those many hundred (six or seven hundred at the
least) which we finde in our Author; whether to shew the
universality of his reading in all kinde of Writers, or his
faculty in Translating (which when he meets with hard Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
he knows how to spare) I shall not determine at the
present: Certain I am, that by the interlarding of his Prose
with so many Verses, he makes the Book look rather like a
<hi>Church-Romance,</hi> (our late <hi>Romancers</hi> being much given to
such kinde of Mixtures) then a well<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Besides that, many of these old ends are so light and
ludicrous, so little pertinent to the business which he has in
hand, that they serve onely to make sport for Children, <hi>(ut

dotages, the most learned and ingenious men in the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> have now laid them by; and it had been very well
if our Author had done so to, but that there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of entertainment for the gentle Reader, and to inflame
the reckoning which he pays not for. But above all things,
recommend me to his <hi>Merry Tales,</hi> and scraps of <hi>Trencher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

jests,</hi> frequently interlaced in all parts of the History; which
if abstracted from the rest, and put into a Book by themselves,
might very well be serv'd up for a second course to the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
of Iosts,</hi> a Supplement to the old Book, entituled, <hi>Wits,
Fits and Fancies;</hi> or an Additional Century to the old <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

they do, they neither do become the gravity of a <hi>Church-Historian,</hi>
nor are consistent with the nature of a sober Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
<pb facs="tcp:61619:11"/>
But as it seems, our Author came with the same
thoughts to the writing of this present History, as Poets
anciently addrest themselves to the writing of Comedies, of

                  <p>6. In the last place proceed we to the manifold excursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about the Antiquity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> built on as weak
Authoritie as the <hi>Monkish</hi> Legends, and so impertinent to
the matter which he hath in hand, that the most Reverend
<hi>Mat. Parker,</hi> (though a <hi>Cambridge</hi> Man) in his <hi>Antiquitates
Britanicae,</hi> makes no business of it: The more impertinent,
in regard that at the fag-end of his Book there follows a
distinct History of that University, to which all former pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
might have been reduced: But as it seems he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to insert nothing in that History but what he had
some probable ground for; leaving the <hi>Legendary</hi> part
thereof to the <hi>Church-Romance,</hi> as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

certainly he is wondrous wise in his generation: For fearing
lest he might be asked for those <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Chartularies</hi> which
frequently he relates unto, in the former Books; he tells us
in the History of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> fol. 53. That they were <hi>burnt</hi>
by some of the seditious <hi>Townsmen in the open Market place,
Anno</hi> 1380. or thereabouts: So that for want of ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

evidence, we must take his word, which whether those
of <hi>Cambridge</hi> will depend upon, they can best resolve. For
my part, I forbear all intermedling in a controversie so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:61619:11"/>
stated, and which hath lain so long asleep, till now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
by our Author to beget new quarrels: Such pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
in that History as come under any <hi>Animadversion,</hi>
have been reduced unto the other, as occasion served, which
the Reader may be pleased to take notice of as they come
before him.</p>
                  <p>7. All these extravagancies and impertinencies (which
make up a fifth part of the whole Volumn) being thus
discharged, it is to be presum'd that nothing should remain
but a meer Church History, as the Title promiseth; But let
us not be too presumptuous on no better grounds: For on a
<hi>Melius inquirendum</hi> into the whole course of the Book w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
we have before us, we shall finde too little of the <hi>Church,</hi>
and too much of the <hi>State,</hi> I mean too little of the <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical,</hi>
and too much of the <hi>Civil History:</hi> It might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
expected, that in a History of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
we should have heard somewhat of the foundation
and enlargement of Cathedral Churches, if not of the
more eminent Monasteries and Religious Houses; and that
we should have heard somewhat more of the succession of
Bishops in their several and respective Sees, their personal
Endowments, learned Writings, and other Acts of Piety,
Magnificence, and publick Interess, especially when the
times afforded any whose names in some of those respects
deserv'd to be retain'd in everlasting remembrance; it might
have been expected also, that we should have found more
frequent mention of the calling of National, and Provincial
Synods, with the result of their proceedings, and the great
influence which they had on the <hi>Civil State,</hi> sparingly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of at the best, and totally discontinued in a maner, from
the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, until the Convocation
of the year, 1552. of which no notice had been taken, but
that he had a minde to question the Authority of the Book
of Articles which came out that year, though publisht as
the issue and product of it, by the express Warrant and
Command of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth: No mention of that
<pb facs="tcp:61619:12"/>
memorable Convocation in the fourth and fifth years of
<hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> in which the Clergy taking notice of an
Act of Parliament then newly passed, by which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the <hi>Temporali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y,</hi> having Lands to the yearly value
of five pounds, and upwards, were charged with finding
Horse and Armour, according to the propertion of their
yearly Revenues and Possessions, did by their sole Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as a Convocation, impose upon themselves and the rest
of the Clergy of this Land, the finding of a like number of
Horses, Armour, and other Necessaries for the War, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their yearly income, proportion for proportion, and
rate for rate, as by that Statute had been laid on the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi>
Subjects: And this they did by their own sole Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as before was said, ordering the same to be levyed on
all such as were refractory, by Sequestration, Deprivation,
Suspension, Excommunication, <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures</hi> all;
without relating to any subsequent confirmation by Act of
Parliament, which they conceiv'd they had no need of:
Nor finde we any thing of the Convocations of Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeths</hi>
time, except that of the year 1562. (and that not
fairly dealt with neither, as is elsewhere shewed) though
there passed many Canons in the Convocation of the year
1571. and of the year 1585. and the year 1597. all Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and still publickly extant; besides the memorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of the year, 1555. in which the Clergy gave the
Queen a Benevolence of 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. in the pound, to be levyed by
Ecclesiastical Censures, without relating to any subsequent
confirmation by Act of Parliament, as had accustomably
been used in the Grant of Subsidies.</p>
                  <p>It might have been expected also that we should have
found in a Church History of <hi>Britain,</hi> the several degrees
and steps by which the Heterodoxies and Superstitions of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did creep in amongst us; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
by which they were ejected and cast out again, and
the whole Reformation setled upon the Doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
attended by the Rites and Ceremonies of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb facs="tcp:61619:12"/>
times; as also that some honorable mention should
be found of those gallant Defences which were made by
Dr. <hi>Bancroft,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bilson,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bridges,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cosins,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others, against the violent Batteries and Assaults of the
<hi>Puritan</hi> Faction in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time; and of the
learned Writings of B. <hi>Buckeridge,</hi> B. <hi>Morton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Dr. <hi>Burges, &amp;c.</hi> in justification of the Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> against the remnants of
that scattered (and then broken) Faction in the time of King
<hi>Iames;</hi> of which we have <hi>Negry quidem,</hi> not a word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered:
Nor could it stand with his design (which will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it self in part in this <hi>Introduction,</hi> and shall more fully
be discovered in the <hi>Animadversions</hi>) that it should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
All which together, make it clear and evident that
there is too little of the Church or Ecclesiastical History in
our Authors Book: And that there is too much of the
State or Civil History, will be easily seen, by that unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
intermixture of State-Concernments, not pertinent to
the business which he hath in hand: Of this sort to look
back no further, is the long Will and Testament of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, with his Gloss or Comment on the same,
taking up three whole sheets at least, in which there is not
any thing which concerns Religion, or which relates unto
the Church, or Church-affairs; although to have the better
colour to bring it in, he tells us that he hath transcribed it,
not onely for the rarity thereof, but because it <hi>contained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
passages which might reflect much light upon his Church-History.</hi>

pomp and order of the Coronation of King <hi>Charls,</hi> which
though he doth acknowledge not to be within the <hi>Pale and
Park</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> History, yet he resolves to bring it in,
because it comes within the <hi>Purlews</hi> of it, as his own words
are: But for this he hath a better reason then we are aware
of, that is to say, <hi>That if hereafter Divine Providence shall
assign</hi> England <hi>another King, though the transactions herein be
<pb facs="tcp:61619:13"/>

Reigns of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in

yet in that small Abstract we finde many Impertinencies, as
to the work he hath in hand, that is to say, The great profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of King <hi>Edward,</hi> in his Grammar Learning, exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

an infinite labor to look into all particulars of this nature,
which are found in our Author, make up a great part of the
Book; but we may guess by this brief view, (as <hi>Ex pede
Hereulem</hi>) that his diversion upon <hi>Civil</hi> Matters and Affairs
of State, which neither have relation to, nor any influence
at all upon those of the Church, do make up a considerable
part of the rest of the Book: Which Civil Matters and
State-Concernments being discharg'd also (as in all reason
they ought to be) we next proceed to the <hi>Church-History</hi> it
self: In which, if we should make the like defalkation, and
expunge every passage which is either positively false, or
ignorantly mistaken by him, there would be very little left

having cleer'd himself from some mis-understanding about

but think that his Majesty being vanquisht by the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>Prebyterians,</hi> had given over the cause; and
therefore as convicted in his Conscience, rendreth them
thanks for the Instruction which he had receiv'd, and the
Civilities they used towards him in the way thereof: But he
that looks upon his Majesties last Paper, will finde that he

And having so done, puts them in minde of three questions
which are propos'd in his former Paper, acknowledg'd by
themselves, to be of great importance in the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie;
without an Answer whereunto, his Majesty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
that he would put an end to that conference: <hi>It not

their great Masters) to return an Answer to those
Questions, his Majesty remain'd sole Master of the field, a
most absolute Conqueror: For though the first blow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

with the King; <hi>concealing</hi> such things as might make for her
justification, and <hi>advocating</hi> for such things as disturb her
order. In the last Book we finde him speaking of some <hi>heats</hi>
which were rais'd in the Church, about placing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Table
<hi>Altar-wise,</hi> and great fault found for the want
of Moderation in those Men, who had the managing of that

The Chappel of <hi>Emmanuel</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi> is

by others (<hi>&amp; populum qui sibi credit habet,</hi> Ovid. in Ep.
Hypsiphil.) as he is like enough to finde many Believers,
farewel to all external Reverence in the Service of God:
What need we trouble our selves or others with standing,
kneeling, bowing in the acts of Worship; it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in what posture the Body be, <hi>so the Heart be right.</hi>
What need we put our selves or others to the charge
of Surplices and Hoods, of Gowns and Cassacks, in
the officiating of Gods Service; It is no matter in
what habit the Body be, <hi>so the heart be right.</hi> There is
another Chappel in <hi>Cambridge</hi> which was never

one to me.) At which when some found themselves grieved,
our Author tells them, <hi>That others of as great Learning and
Religion</hi> (himself especially for one) <hi>dare defend, that the

purpose, doth sufficiently consecrate the same: Stables</hi> and <hi>Barns</hi>

for their ease to be pent up in so narrow a Room, tis

in the Chappels Royal, (for which he was censur'd in the
Star-Chamber) must be brought in by head &amp; shoulders, out
of time and place, for fear least such an excellent piece of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanical
Zeal should be lost to posterity: These things I
might have noted in their proper places, but that they were
reseru'd for this as a taste to the rest.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Et jam finis erat,</hi> and here I thought I should have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Anatomy of our Authors Book, but that there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
passage in the Preface thereof, which requires a little
further consideration: For in that Preface he informs us by
the way of caution, <hi>That the three first Books were for the
main written in the Reign of the late King, as appeareth by the
Passages then proper for the Government: The other nine Books
were made since Monarchy was turned into a State.</hi> By which
it seems, that our Author never meant to frame his History
by the line of truth, but to attemper it to the palat of the
present Government, whatsoever it then was, or should
prove to be, which I am sure agrees not with the Laws of
History. And though I can most easily grant, that the fourth
Book, and the rest that follow, were written after the great
alteration and change of State, in making a <hi>new</hi> Commonwealth
out of the ruines of an ancient Monarchy; yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
not with our Author in the time of the former: For it
appears by some passages, that the three first Books, either
were not all written in the time of the King, or else he must
give himself some disloyal hopes, that the King should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be restored to his place and Powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, by which he might
be called to a reckoning for them. For in the second Book
he reckons the Cross in Baptism for a Popish Trinket, by
which it appears not, I am sure, to have been written in the
time of the Kingly Government, that being no expression
<pb facs="tcp:61619:16"/>
sutable unto such a time. Secondly, speaking of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
which was sixt in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by removing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiscopal
See from <hi>London</hi> thither, he telleth us that <hi>the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> is not mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h, which See went first, when living, seeing
our Age <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

certainly the Government was not chang'd into a State or
Commonwealth, till the death of the King; and till the
death of the King, neither of those Episcopal Sees, nor any
of the rest, were laid so level in <hi>their Graves,</hi> but that they
were in hope of a Resurrection; the King declaring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
very constantly in the Treaty at the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> as
well against the abolishing of the Episcopal Government, as
the alienation of their Lands. Thirdly, In the latter end of
the same Book he makes a great dispute against the high and
sacred priviledge of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> in curing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
commonly called the <hi>Kings Evil,</hi> whether to be imputed
to <hi>Magick,</hi> or <hi>Imagina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

brings us in an old Wives Tale about Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as if
she had disclaimed that power which she daily exercised;
and finally, manageth a Quarrel against the form of Prayer
used at the curing of that Evil, which he arraigns for Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
and impertinencies, no inferior Crimes: Are all these
Passages proper to that Government also? Finally in the
third Book he derogates from the power of the Church, in
making <hi>Canons</hi> giving the binding and concluding Power
in matters which concern the Civil Rights of the Subjects,
not to the King, but to the Lay-people of the Land assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ighth and last: And though it might be safe enough for him
in the eighth &amp; last to derogate in this maner from the Kings
supremacy in Ecclesiastical affairs; yet certainly it was neither
safe for him so to do, nor proper for him so to write in the
time of the <hi>Kingl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the rest that follow, I found my self possest with much
<pb facs="tcp:61619:16"/>
indignation, and long expected when some Champion would
appear in the lists against this <hi>Goliah,</hi> who so reproachfully
had <hi>defiled the whole Armies of Israel.</hi> And I must needs
confess withal, that I did never enter more unwillingly upon
any undertaking, then I did on this: But being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ollicited
thereunto by Letters, Messages, and several personal Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
by men of all Orders and Dignities in the Church, and
of all Degrees in the Universities, I was at last overcome by
that importunity which I found would not be resisted: I
know, that, as the times now stand, I am to expect nothing
for my Pains and Travel, but the displeasure of some, and
the censure of others: But coming to the work with a single
heart, abstracted from all self-ends and private Interesses, I
shall satisfie my self with having done this poor service to
the Church, my once Blessed Mother, for whose sake onely
I have put my self upon this Adventure. The party whom
I am to deal with, is so much a stranger to me, that he is
neither <hi>beneficio, nec injurià notus,</hi> and therefore no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
respects have mov'd me to the making of these Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,
which I have writ (without relation to his person)
for vindication of the truth, the Church, and the injured
Clergy, as before is said: So that I may affirm with an
honest Conscience: <hi>Non lecta est operi sed data causa
meo,</hi> That this implo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon me; the unresistable intreaties of so many friends
having something in them of Commands: But howsoever,

(or <hi>Londinum</hi>) as we read in <hi>Tacitus.</hi> The name and

<hi>Roman</hi> race; as the great Temple in or near the

The <hi>Britans</hi> worshipping <hi>Apollo,</hi> by the
name of <hi>Belinus,</hi> as both <hi>Camden</hi> and our Author
say they did, must be suppos'd to have another name
for <hi>Diana</hi> also; and were more likely to have call'd
her by the name of <hi>Artemis,</hi> her old <hi>Grecian</hi> name,
or by some other of as neer a remembrance to it, as
<hi>Belinus</hi> was to that of <hi>Bel</hi> in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries.
Assuredly if that great City had received this name from
<hi>Dianas</hi> Temple, the <hi>Welch,</hi> being so tenacious of their

This is the substance of the story, as by him delivered,
true in the main, though possibly there may be some
mistake in his Chronology, as in a matter not so canvas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
as it hath been lately.</p>
                  <p>Now to proceed unto our Author, he tells us fol. 10.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> out of <hi>Ieffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth, That at this time there were in</hi>
England <hi>twenty eight Cities, each of them having a</hi> Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<hi>or</hi> Pagan Priest; <hi>and three of them, namely</hi> London,
York, <hi>and</hi> Caer-Lion <hi>in</hi> Wales, <hi>had</hi> Archflamens, <hi>to
which the rest were subjected: and</hi> Lucius <hi>placed</hi> Bishops
<hi>in the room of the</hi> Flamens, <hi>and</hi> Archbishops, Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans
<hi>in the places of</hi> Archflamens; concluding in the
way of scorn, that his Flamines, and Archflamines seem
to be Flams and Archflams, even notorious falshoods.]
And it is well they do but <hi>seem</hi> so, it being possibly
enough that they may <hi>seem Falshoods</hi> to our Author,
<hi>even notorious Falshoods,</hi> though they seem true enough
to others, even apparent truths. And first though <hi>Ief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fery</hi>
of <hi>Monmouth</hi> seem to deserve no credit in this
particular, where he speaks against our Authors sense;
yet in another place where he comes up to his desires he
is otherwise thought of, and therefore made the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the grand Inquest against <hi>Augustino</hi> the Monk,
whom he enditeth for the murther of the Monks of
<hi>Bancor.</hi> And certainly if <hi>Ieffery</hi> may be believ'd when
he speaks in passion, <hi>when his Welch bloud
was up,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 2. fol. 63.</note> as our Author words it, as one that
was <hi>concerned in the cause of his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi>
he may more easily be believ'd in a cause of so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Antiquity, where neither love nor hatred, or any
other prevalent affection had any power or reason to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
him from the way of truth. And secondly, though
<hi>Ieffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> be a Writer of no great credit with
me, when he stands single by himself, yet when I finde
him seconded and confirmed by others, I shall not
brand a truth by the name of falshood, because he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports

it. Now that in <hi>Britain</hi> at that time there were

they stand not only on the credit of <hi>Ieffery</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
but of all our own Writers, who speak of the

But where both our Author and some others have rais'd

                     <hi>Flamines</hi> in one City, yet was there only one which
was called <hi>Pontifex</hi> or <hi>Primus Flaminum;</hi> the Pope or
principal of the <hi>Flamines;</hi> of which kinde one for every
City, were those whom our Historians speak of. And
for the <hi>Archi-Flamines</hi> or <hi>Proto-Flamines,</hi> though the
name occurre not in old <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, yet were there
some in power and Authority above the rest, who
were entituled <hi>Primi Pontificum</hi> (as indeed
<hi>Coifi</hi> by that name is called in <hi>Beda</hi>) which
is the same in sense with <hi>Arch-flamines</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not in sound.<note place="margin">Beda Hist. Ecclesi st. l 2. c. 13.</note> All I shall further
add is this, that if these 28 Cities were not all furnished
with Bishops in the time of <hi>Lucius</hi> for whom it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to spread his armes and expresse his power over
all the South parts of the Iland; yet may the honour
of the work be ascribed to him, because begun by his
encouragement, and perfected by his example; as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>
is generally esteemed for the Founder of <hi>Rome,</hi>
although the least part of that great City was of his
Foundation.</p>
                  <p>Our Author has not yet done with <hi>Lucius.</hi> For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the story to be true, he disallowes the turning

see whether he be not guilty of some sin of Commission
also. For making a general muster of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Gods,
and shewing how they were dispos'd of in relation to the
days of the week, he concludes it thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Fol. 55. <hi>And thus we see the whole week bescattered
with</hi> Saxon <hi>Idols, whose Pagan Gods were the God-fathers
of the days, and gave them their names.]</hi> Not the <hi>whole
week,</hi> though the greatest part thereof was thus bescat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
<hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Munday</hi> being so call'd in reference
to the Sun and Moon, or else in correspondence to the
the names of <hi>Dies Solis,</hi> and <hi>Dies Lunae,</hi> which they
found given by the <hi>Romans</hi> at their entrance here. For
either the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> were worshipped by the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Saxons,</hi> and then might think themselves neglected
in having no place assigned them amongst the rest; or
else the <hi>Saxon Pagan Gods were not the Godfathers to all
the days of the week,</hi> as our Author telleth us. As much
he seems to be mistaken in their God called <hi>Woden,</hi> of
whom thus he telleth us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> Fol. 54. Woden, <hi>that is wood, fierce or furious, giving

Ditch <hi>of</hi> Wooden <hi>or</hi> Mercury, <hi>and as it should
seem of</hi> Woden <hi>that false imagined God and
Father of the</hi> English-Saxons. And herein I shall rather
subscribe to <hi>Camdens</hi> then our Authors judgement. For
certainly had the Saxons worshipped <hi>Wooden</hi> as the God
of Battail, or <hi>correspondent unto Mars,</hi> they would have
given him the third day of the week, or the day of <hi>Mars,</hi>
and not the fourth day of the week, or the day of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi>
as they gave <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Munday</hi> unto <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and <hi>Thursday</hi> unto <hi>Thur,</hi> whom they worshipped in
the place of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> ascribing unto him (as the <hi>Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Romans</hi> did to <hi>Iupiter</hi>) the power of bearing rule in
the Air, governing Thunder, Lightnings, Windes, Showres,
fair weather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Adam Bremensis</hi> a good Writer doth
inform us of them. And though it may be true, which
our Author telleth us, that <hi>by his aid and furtherance they
hoped to obtain victory,</hi> yet this entitleth him not to the
place of <hi>Mars;</hi> as many victories being gotten by wit
and stratagem (the known Arts of <hi>Mercury</hi>) as by strength
and valour. But from our Authors failers in recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the superstitions of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Ancestors, let us next
see how he behaves himself in laying down the story of
their conversion. In which though he ascribe something
unto <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk, yet he will by no means allow him
to be their Apostle.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 54. <hi>The</hi> Papists (saith he) <hi>commonly call</hi> Augustine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/>
                     <hi>the English Apostle, how</hi> properly <hi>we shall see hereafter.</hi>
And after fol. 68. <hi>The Papists brag that he was the Apostle
of the English.</hi>] In these few words there are two things
to be considered, whether he is called <hi>the Apostle of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61619:31"/>
English,</hi> by the <hi>Papists</hi> only, and secondly, whether he
were not so both in fact and title. Not call'd so by the
<hi>Papists</hi> only, I am sure of that; but called so commonly
by as good Protestants as our Author himself.
Thus <hi>Camden</hi> a right English Protestant,<note place="margin">Camd. Brit. fol. 136.</note> 
                     <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this</hi> Augustine, <hi>whom commonly they call
the</hi> Apostle <hi>of the</hi> English <hi>men, being sent
hither by</hi> Gregory <hi>the Great, having abolished these mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous

                        </gap>erted them to the</hi>
Christain <hi>faith.</hi> Nor doth he speak this only in the
voice of the common people, but in another place more
plainly as his own opinion. <hi>A place there
is about this Shire called</hi> Austins Oke,<note place="margin">Id. in Worcest. fol. 578.</note> 
                     <hi>at
which</hi> Augustine <hi>the</hi> Apostle <hi>of the</hi> English
men, <hi>and the</hi> Bishops <hi>of</hi> Britain <hi>met,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Philemon Holland</hi> of <hi>Coventry,</hi> a good Protestant
also, making an Index unto <hi>Camden,</hi> speaks the self same
language; Augustine <hi>the Apostle of the</hi> English; which
is short, but full. <hi>Gabriel Richardson</hi> of <hi>Brazen Nose,</hi> an
honest Protestant, in his laborious piece
called the <hi>State of Europe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Richardsons <hi>state of</hi> Europe. lib. 3.</note> telleth us of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> that the <hi>Archbishops See was
founded by King</hi> Ethelbert <hi>in the person of</hi>
St. Austin <hi>the Apostle of the</hi> English. More of this kinde
might be produc'd, were it not given us for a Rule in
the holy Scripture, <hi>Ex ore duorum testium vel trium,</hi>
that two or three witnesses were sufficient to confirm a
truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> The next thing here to be considered is, whether
<hi>Austin</hi> were not the Apostle of the <hi>English,</hi> both in fact
and title. In order whereunto, we must first take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the word being meerly <hi>Greek,</hi> doth signifie in
its natural and original sense a <hi>Messenger, a Legat,</hi> an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,</hi>
from whom, to whomsoever sent; and though
appropriated to the twelve as by way of excellence,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61619:31"/>
yet not improperly communicated unto others in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
times, with reference to the Nations whom
they had converted. So <hi>Boniface</hi> an <hi>English</hi> man the
first Archbishop of <hi>Ments</hi> is called by Dr. <hi>Holland,</hi> (as by
many others) the Apostle of <hi>Germany, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius</hi>
styled by <hi>Camden the</hi> Apostle <hi>of the</hi>
Scottish <hi>Nation;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Camd. in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, fol. 45.</note> and the <hi>Irish</hi> would not
think themselves to be fairly dealt with,
if their St. <hi>Patrick</hi> should not be honoured with that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
also. In this sense <hi>Austin</hi> may be call'd, and that
not improperly, the Apostle of the <hi>English</hi> Nation;
though a <hi>derivative Apostle,</hi> an <hi>Apostle</hi> (as our Author
calls him in the way of scorn, <hi>fol.</hi> 68.) <hi>at the second hand,</hi>
though others propagated the Gospel further then he
liv'd to do. It was enough to entitle him to this
<hi>Apostleship,</hi> that he first publickly preacht the Gospel,
and brought the glad Tiding of Salvation amongst the
<hi>English,</hi> though he neither converted all the Nation,
nor travelled into all parts of the Land to attempt the
same. Neither <hi>St. Paul</hi> could be entituled the Apostle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/>
of the <hi>Gentiles, St. Thomas</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> nor <hi>St. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
of the <hi>Ethiopians;</hi> if it were necessarily required to
their Apostleships, that all the Nations of the <hi>Indians</hi>
must be converted by the one, or the vast Countries of the
<hi>Ethiopians</hi> must be conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ted by the other; or finally, if
<hi>St. Paul</hi> to save them a labour, must have reduced all
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the faith of <hi>Christ.</hi> And this the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
for the King of <hi>England</hi> at the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi>
understood right well, when they contended for prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
with those of <hi>Castile.</hi> For when the <hi>Castilians</hi> had
objected, that although <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> had preacht
in <hi>England,</hi> it was but in a corner thereof, the grand
body of <hi>Britain</hi> remaining <hi>Pagan</hi> many hundred years
after: the <hi>English</hi> Embassadors wisely answered, that
the Allegation was impertinent to the present purpose,
it being not the Universality, but the first Preaching
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61619:32"/>
of the Christian Faith which gained the name of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle;
there being no Disciple (as they truly urged it) that
ever converted a Kingdom totally and entirely to
Christianity, for which consult our very Author, <hi>Lib. 4.
fol.</hi> 181.</p>
                  <p>And yet the pains in preaching of <hi>Austin</hi> were not so
limited and restrain'd to one Kingdom only, but that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> he travel'd into most parts of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Heptarchy,
preaching the Gospel in all places to which the Spirit
did conduct him, or his business lead him. Our Author
grants him to have converted the Kingdom of <hi>Kent,
fol.</hi> 7. and to have taken care for planting the Gospel
in the Kingdom of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> and for that end or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
<hi>Mellitus</hi> the first Bishop of <hi>London, fol.</hi> 67. From
hence he carries him to a conference with the <hi>British</hi>
Bishops in the Countrey of the <hi>Wiccians</hi> (now <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stershire</hi>)
then part of the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia, fol.</hi> 60.
From thence to <hi>Richmondshire</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi>
where he is said to have baptiz'd above ten
thousand in one day, <hi>fol.</hi> 66. And finally to <hi>Cern</hi> in <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setshire,</hi>
part of the Kingdom of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> where
he destroyed the Idol of <hi>Heale</hi> or <hi>Aesculapius.</hi> By which
we see, that he visited no fewer, then five of the seven
Kingdoms in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Heptarchie, not only doing in
each of them that particular work which he went about,
but preaching in all fit places as he passed along. And
this considered as it ought, with reference to the distance
of those several places to which our very Author brings
him, gives him just title to that honor which our Author
would so willingly deprive him of, when telling us
how the Papists called him the <hi>English</hi> Apostle, he
adds these words, <hi>how properly</hi> (so called) <hi>we shall see here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have spent more time then I intended in defence of
this Title, and therefore think it seasonable to proceed
from the Person to his Acts. Of which the first we meet

But here I must needs aske our Author, whether he
thinks, that this was really one of those many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
which occasioned <hi>Austin</hi> to resolve of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
for his seat of residence. If yea, then must our

                     </gap>e could not be taken by him into
consideratior, as indeed it was not. For first, <hi>London</hi> at
that time was the chief City of the Kingdom of <hi>East-sex,</hi>
one of the weakest of the seven, and so not likely
to prevail over all the rest. Secondly, if any of the
greater Kingdoms of <hi>Mercia, West-sex,</hi> or <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
should in fine prevail, it was not not probable
that the Conquerors would remove the Seat Royal
from their own Dominions into any of the conquered
Countries. And thirdly, though the Kings of the
<hi>West-Saxons,</hi> who prevailed at last, and became Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
of the whole, setled the Royal Seat in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
yet was it not till <hi>Winchester</hi> their own Regal
City was destroyed by fire, and made unable to receive
them.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 60. <hi>The first cast of his office was to call a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/>

many distinct languages in that one Continent, as there
were Barbarous Nations planted in it, or at the least such
different Dialects, as could be scarse intelligible unto
one another. Whereas it is certainly and most plainly
known, that there is only one Language spoken in all
that Countrey, equally understood by all, without so
much as any sensible difference in pronunciation; more
then is usuall in all places between the Countrey Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages

before it was inclos'd</hi> (that is to say, divided) <hi>into several

as weakly grounded, such as I marvel at in our Author,
who having travel'd over all the <hi>Holy-Land,</hi> should have
been better studied in the true nature and original of the
<hi>Holy-Tongue.</hi> Nor is it the opinion only, that this
<hi>Tongue</hi> was spoken universally before the Flood, and
even in <hi>Paradise</hi> it self in the state of innocency; but
that it shall be spoken in the Celestial <hi>Paradise,</hi> the

But against this it is disputed; first that it is but
a <hi>Tradition,</hi> and therefore of no sure foundation
to build upon. And secondly, that it is such a
<hi>Tradition,</hi> as holds no good coherence with the truth of
Story; it being a most clear and demonstrative truth,
that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue was not the Language which
<hi>Abraham</hi> brought with him out of <hi>Chaldea</hi> and <hi>Mesopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>

posterity did conform themselves. Or had it been the

was not) yet, thirdly, had this been a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
conferred on <hi>Heber,</hi> that he and his posterity should
speak the Original Language without alteration or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
it must have been extended to all those of the

and <hi>Esau;</hi> and not be limited and confined only to
the House of <hi>Iacob.</hi> Now that the language which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
was, and still is called by the name of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
was spoken vulgarly in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> before
the coming of <hi>Abraham</hi> thither, is not affirmed by <hi>Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
only, but by <hi>Scaliger, Grotius, Vossius, Bochartus,</hi>
(all of them men of great renown for their learned stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
and by many others of this Age. By most of which
it is affirmed also, that the name of <hi>Hebrews</hi> was given
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61619:36"/>
unto them by the people of <hi>Canaan,</hi> not in regard of
their descent from <hi>Heber</hi> the father of <hi>Phaleg,</hi> but from
<hi>Abrahams</hi> passing over the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> when he
came out of <hi>Chaldaea</hi> with his Family to dwell amongst
them; that name in the <hi>Canaanitish</hi> language signifying as
much as <hi>trajiciens</hi> or <hi>transfluvialis;</hi> and therefore not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly
given by them to <hi>Abraham</hi> at his first coming thither.
And if the <hi>Hebrew</hi> (as we now call it) was that Holy
Language which was spoken in <hi>Paradise,</hi> continued by
the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the <hi>Flood,</hi> and after to the building
of <hi>Babel;</hi> it must needs seem infinitely strange, that it
should be reserv'd only amongst the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> accursed
in the person of <hi>Canaan</hi> (their common Parent) by his

filthy wickednesses, that he resolv'd to spew them out
of their Native Countrey, as in fine he did. Or if <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

                     <hi>in the Land, made, some by the</hi> Britains, <hi>others by the</hi>
Danes, <hi>others by the</hi> English, <hi>&amp;c. He caused some few of
the best to be selected, and the rest as captious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary,
to be rejected; from whence they had the name of
the Common Lawes.]</hi> That the Common-Law was so
call'd because compounded of the <hi>Saxon, British,</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61619:40"/>
and <hi>Danish</hi> Lawes, which were before of force only
in such places where the <hi>Danes, Britans,</hi> and <hi>Saxon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
had the greatest sway; though it be easie to be said, will
be hard to be proved. The <hi>Britans</hi> at that time liv'd
under their own Princes, and were governed by
their own Lawes, and so they were for a long time
after; so that King <hi>Edward</hi> having no dominion
over them could not impose a Law upon them. Not
was it probable that he should borrow any of their
Lawes, or impose them on his natural subjects, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Antipathy and disaffection betwixt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
There were indeed at that time in <hi>England</hi>
three kinds of Lawes. The first called <hi>Dane-lage</hi> or
the <hi>Danish</hi> Lawes, prevailing for the most part in the
Kingdom of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> and that of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
secondly <hi>Saxon-lage,</hi> used generally in the Kingdoms
of the <hi>West-Saxons, East-Saxons, South-Saxons,</hi> and that of
<hi>Kent;</hi> and thirdly, <hi>Merce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>-lage,</hi> extending over all the
Provinces of the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia.</hi> As for the <hi>Britans</hi>
of <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> they had no distinct Law
for themselves (as had those of <hi>Wales</hi>) but were gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Lawes of that Nation unto which they
were subject. By these three sorts of Laws were these
Nations governed in their several and respective limits,
which being afterwards reduced into one body, and
made common equally to all the subjects, did worthily
deserve the name of the Common-Law. But second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I dare not give the honour of this action to King
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/>
                     <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor. The great <hi>Iustinian</hi> in this work
was another <hi>Edward,</hi> called, for distinctions sake, King
<hi>Edward</hi> the elder, who began his Reign <hi>Anno</hi> 900. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
150 years before this <hi>Confessor,</hi> to whom our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath ascribed it. But the truth is, that these Lawes
being suppressed by the <hi>Danish</hi> Kings who governed
either in an arbitrary way, or by the Lawes of their
own Countrey, they were revived and reinforced in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61619:40"/>
the time of this <hi>Edward,</hi> from whence they had the
name of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessors Lawes, and by that
name were sued and fought for in the time succeeding,
of which more hereafter. Now as this work may be
ascribed to his love to justice, so from his piety, his
successors derive as great a benefit of curing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
which from thence is called the Kings evill, which

<hi>Marcus Antonius de Dominis Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Spalato,</hi> who

notwithstanding, he was kept prisoner all the rest of his

life, and his body burnt to ashes after his decease. So
then it is no such new matter for a dissenting Christian,
such as <hi>Wickliffe</hi> and <hi>de Dominis</hi> were, though branded
by the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And all this while we have expected that our Author
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="83"/> would have given us a brief summary of <hi>Wickliffes</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
that by seeing the Piety and <hi>Orthodoxie</hi> of his
Opinions, we might have thought more reverently both
of him and his Followers. But therein our expectation
must remain unsatisfied, our Author thinking it more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to his Design to hold the Reader in suspense,
and conceal this from him: dealing herein as the old
<hi>Germans</hi> did with those of other Nations, who came to
wait upon <hi>Valeda</hi> a great Queen amongst them; not
suffering any to have a sight of her, to keep them in
a greater admiration of her parts and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

with so many and such dangerous <hi>Tares,</hi> that to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

therefore our Author having formerly honored his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
by the name of <hi>Gospel,</hi> and his followers with
the Title of <hi>Gods servants,</hi> as before was noted; had
reason not to shew them all at once, in a lump toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that we might think them better and more <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi>
then indeed they were. But the best is (to save
us the trouble of consulting <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> and others who
have written of them) our Author hath given them us
at last on another occasion, <hi>Lib. 5. fol.</hi> 208. many of
which the Reader may peruse in these Ammadversions,
Numb. 113. Thus having laid together so much of
this present Book as relates to <hi>Wickliffe</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,

it, not far from a little dore which openeth into one of

of <hi>France,</hi> by him and his successors, to be enjoyed

And secondly, that <hi>Bernard,</hi> whom the
<hi>Latine</hi> cals <hi>Episcopus Aquensis</hi> is very ill taken by our
Author to be <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Aix.</hi> He was indeed Bishop of

from whence those parts of <hi>France</hi> had the name
of <hi>Aquitaine;</hi> and not of <hi>Aix</hi> (which the antient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
called <hi>Aquae Sextiae</hi>) in the Countrey of <hi>Provence.</hi>
Now <hi>Guienne</hi> was at that time in the power of the Kings
of <hi>England,</hi> which was the reason why this <hi>Bernard</hi>
was sent with the rest of the Commissioners to the

maintained the rights and preheminences of the <hi>English</hi>

                  <p>In agitating of which controversie as it stands in our
Author, I finde mention of one <hi>Iohannes de Voragine a
worthless Author,</hi> fol. 181. Mistook both in the name
of the man, and his quality also. For first, the Author
of the Book called <hi>Legenda aurea</hi> related to in the
former passage, was not <hi>Iohannes,</hi> but <hi>Iacobus de Vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

In which Book, though there are many idle and
unwarrantable fictions; yet secondly was the man of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="93"/> more esteem, then to passe under the Character of a
<hi>Worthless Author,</hi> as being learned for the times in

(were there nothing else) to free him from

cannot think so charitably of some other errors of this

Where amongst the <hi>English Dukes</hi> which carryed the
title of Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he reckoneth <hi>Edmund</hi> of
<hi>Langly</hi> fifth son to <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Edward</hi> his son,
<hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> his brother, father to King
<hi>Edward</hi> the fourth. But first this <hi>Richard</hi> whom he
speaks of, though he were Earl of <hi>Cambridge</hi> by the

Duke of <hi>York; Richard</hi> being executed at <hi>South-Hampton</hi>

an <hi>Animadversion.</hi> Our Author there chargeth
Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> for avowing something which he cannot justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
that is to say, for saying, <q>That when <hi>William</hi> of
<hi>Wainfleet</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> (afterwards founder of
<hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge) perswaded King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth
to erect some Monument for Learning in <hi>Oxford,</hi> the
King returned, <hi>Imo potius Cantabrigiae, ut duas (si fieri
possit) in Anglia Academias habeam.</hi> Yea rather (said he)
at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that (if it be possible) I may have two
Universities in <hi>England.</hi>

But here the premises only are the Doctors, the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
or conclusion is our Authors own. The Doctor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
not thereupon, that <hi>Cambridge was not reputed an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
till the founding of</hi> Kings <hi>Colledge by King</hi> Henry

<hi>Vniversity</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the second. All
that the Doctor says, is this, <hi>that as the Vniversity
of</hi> Cambridge <hi>was of a later foundation</hi> then <hi>Oxford</hi> was,
<hi>so it was long before it grew into esteem,</hi> that is to say, to
such a measure of esteem at home or abroad (before the
building of <hi>Kings</hi> Colledge, and the rest that followed)
but that the King might use those words in his Discourse
with the Bishop of <hi>Winchester.</hi> And for the Narrative,
the Doctor (whom I have talked with in this business)
doth not shame to say, that he borrowed it, from that

too much a friend to Mr. <hi>Wake,</hi> who was Fellow of the

Edward <hi>the sixth, we might presently have heard of a</hi> King
Henry <hi>the ninth.</hi>] Our Author speaks this of <hi>Henry Fitz
Roy,</hi> the Kings natural Son by <hi>Elizabeth Blunt,</hi> and the
great disturbance he might have wrought to the Kings
two Daughters in their Succession to the Crown. A Prince
indeed whom his Father very highly cherished, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> and <hi>Richmond,</hi> Earl of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi>
and Earl Marshal of <hi>England,</hi> and raising him
to no small hopes of the Crown it self, as appears plainly
by the Statute 22 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 7. But whereas our Author
speaks it on a supposition of his <hi>surviving King Edward</hi>
the <hi>sixth,</hi> he should have done well in the first place to
have inform'd himself whether, this <hi>Henry</hi> and Prince
<hi>Edward</hi> were at any time alive together. And if my
Books speak true, they were not; <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> and
<hi>Richmond</hi> dying the 22. of <hi>Iuly, Anno</hi> 1536. Prince
<hi>Edward</hi> not being born till the 12. of <hi>October, An.</hi> 1537.
So that if our Author had been but as good at Law or

of a Survivor-ship in such a case, when the one person had
been long dead before the other was born.</p>

These incoherent Animadversions being thus passed

<hi>Principles,</hi> for weakning the Authority of the

of <hi>Parliaments.</hi> Concerning which he had before given
us two Rules Preparatory to the great business which
we have in hand. First <hi>that the proceedings of the Canon
Law were subject in whatsoever touched temporals to secular
Laws and National Customs. And the Laitie at pleasure
limited Canons in this behalf,</hi> Lib. 3. n. 61. And secondly,
<hi>that the King by consent of Parliament directed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Ecclesiastical Court in cases of Heresie. Lib.</hi>

to be made, but that it was much more obnoxious
to the secular Courts, when it began to sink in reputation,
and decline in strength. How true and justifiable, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
how unjustifiable and false these two principles are,
we have shewn already, and must now look into the
rest, which our Author in pursuance of the main Design
hath presented to us. But first we must take notice of
another passage concerning the calling of Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Synodical meetings, formerly called by the two
Archbishops in their several Provinces by their own sole
and proper power, as our Author grants, <hi>fol.</hi> 190. to
which he adds,</p>
                  <p>Fol. 190. <hi>But after the Statute of</hi> Praemunire <hi>was made
(which did much restrain the Papal power, and subject it
to the Laws of the Land) when Archbishops called no more
Convocations by their sole and absolute command, but at the
pleasure of the King.</hi>] In which I must confess my self to
be much unsatisfied, though I finde the same position in
some other Authors. My reasons two, 1. Because there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="116"/>
is nothing in the Statute of <hi>Praemunire</hi> to restrain the
Archbishops from calling these meetings as before; that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61619:66"/>
Act extending only to such as <hi>purchase or pursue, or cause
to be purchased or pursued, in the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
any such translatations, Processes, Sentences of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
Bulls, Instruments, or any other things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
which touch the King, against him, his Crown and
his Regality, or his Realm; or to such as bring within the
Realm or them receive, or make thereof notification, or any
other Execution whatsoever within the same Realm, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
&amp;c.</hi> And 2. because I finde in the Statute of the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the Clergy,</hi> that it was recognized and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the <hi>Clergie</hi> in their <hi>Convocation,</hi>
that the <hi>Convocation</hi> of the said <hi>Clergie</hi> is,<note place="margin">Stat. 25 H 8. c. 19.</note>
always hath been, <hi>and ought to be assembled
always by the Kings Writ.</hi> And if they had
been always call'd by the Kings Writ, then certainly
before the Statute of <hi>Praemunire;</hi> for that the whole
Clergy in their <hi>Convocation</hi> should publickly declare and
avow a notorious falsehood, especially in a matter of fact,
is not a thing to be imagined. I must confess my self to
be at a loss in this intricate Labyrinth, unless perhaps
there were some critical difference in those elder times
between a <hi>Synod</hi> and a <hi>Convocation:</hi> the first being call'd by
the Archbishops in their several and respective Provinces,
as the necessities of the Church; the other only by the
King, as his occasions and affairs did require the same.
But whether this were so or not, is not much material,
as the case now stands, the <hi>Clergie</hi> not assembling since
the 25 of <hi>King Henry the eighth,</hi> but as they are convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated

when the Kings power signified in his <hi>Royal assent</hi>

that the Clergy of this Realm should act Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
and Supremely in the Convocations, and they in
Parliament do nothing but as it was confirmed and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by the Royal assent. By which it seems that

Answer unto which Remonstrance being drawn up by

to the hindrance of his divorce, which was at

on the receipt of this paper remov'd first to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel

resolved to reform the Church under his inspection
from grosse abuses crept into it.</hi>] To this I need no other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="119"/>
Answer then our Author himself, who though in this
place he makes the Parliament to be joyned in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
with the Convocation, as if a joynt Agent in
that great business of Reforming the Church; yet in
another place he tels us another tale. <q>For fol. 188.
it will appear, saith he, (and I can tell from whom he
saith it) upon serious examination, that there was
nothing done in the Reformation of Religion, save
what was acted by the Clergy in their Convocations,
or grounded on some Act of theirs precedent to it,
with the Advice, Counsel and Consent of the Bishops
and most eminent Churchmen; confirmed upon the
Postfact, and not otherwise by the Civill Sanction,
according to the usage of the best and happiest times
of Christianity.</q> So then the Reformation of the
Church was acted chiefly by the King with the advice

that Act of Parliament, in which the <hi>submission</hi> of the
<hi>Clergy</hi> and the Authority of the King grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
is notified and recorded to succeeding times; nor
any such reservation to themselves of a confirming
power as our Author speaks of in any Act of Parliament
(I can knowingly and boldly say it) from that time to
this. Had there been any such Priviledge, any such
<hi>Reservation</hi> as is here declared, their power, in <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Ecclesiastical Canons</hi> had been Lord Paramount to
the Kings; who could have acted nothing in it but as
he was enabled by his Houses of Parliament. Nor is
this only a new and unheard of Paradox, an Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxie
(as I may call it) in point of Law, but plainly
contrary to the practice of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> from
that time to this; there being no <hi>Synodical Canons</hi> or
Constitutions (I dare as boldly say this too) confirmed
in Parliament, or any otherwise ratified, then by the
superadding of the Royal assent. For proof whereof

are not a few particulars, in which those Canons do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the property and persons of such Refusers
as are concerned in the same; which our Author may
soon finde in them if he list to look. And having so done,
let him give us the like Precedent for his Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
(either abstractedly in themselves, or in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation
with the King) in confirming Canons; and we
shall gladly quit the cause, and willingly submit to his

                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>But if it be Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ected, as perhaps it may, That
the Subsidies granted by the Clergy in the Convocation
are ratified and confirmed by Act of Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can be levied either on the Granters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or the rest of the Clergy.</p>
                  <p>I answer, that this makes nothing to our Authors
purpose, that is to say, that <hi>the person or property of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusers
should not be subjected to temporal penalty without
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61619:69"/>
consent of Parliament.</hi> For first, before the submission of
the Clergy to King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. they granted Subsidies
and other aids unto the King in their Convocations, and
levied them upon the persons concerned therein by no
other way then the usuall Censures of the Church, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
by Suspension and deprivation, if any <hi>Refuser</hi> prove so
refractary as to dispute the payment of the sum imposed.
And by this way they gave and levied that great sum of
an Hundred thousand pounds in the Province of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
only, by which they bought their peace of the said
King <hi>Henry,</hi> at such time as he had caused them to be
attainted in the <hi>Praemunire.</hi> And secondly, there is a like
Precedent for it since the said <hi>Submission.</hi> For whereas
the Clergy in their Convocation in the year 1585. being
the 27 year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> had given that Queen
a Subsidy of four shillings in the pound confirmed by
Act of Parliament in the usual way; they gave her at
the same time (finding their former gift too short for her
present occasions) a <hi>Benevolence</hi> of two shillings in the
pound to be raised upon all the Clergy by vertue of their
own Synodical Act only, under the penalty of such
Ecclesiastical Censures as before were mentioned. Which
precedent was after followed by the Clergy in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.
<hi>an.</hi> 1640. the Instrument of the Grant being the
same <hi>verbatim</hi> with that before; though so it hapned (such
influence have the times on the actions of men) that they
were quarreld and condemned for it by the following
Parliament in the time of the King, and not so much as
checkt at, or thought to have gone beyond their bounds
in the time of the Queen. And for the ratifying of their
Bill by Act of Parliament, it came up first at such times
(after the Submission before mentioned) as the Kings of
<hi>England</hi> being in distrust of their Clergy, did not think
fit to impower them by their Letters Patents for the
making of any Synodical Acts, Canons, or Constitutions
whatsoever, by which their Subsidies have been levied in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61619:69"/>
former times, but put them off to be confirmed and made
Obligatory by Act of Parliament. Which being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
found to be the more expedite way, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as derogatory to the Churches Rights, was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in succeeding times without doubt or scruple;
the Church proceeding in all other cases by her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tive
power, even in cases where both the person and property
of the Subject were alike concerned, as by the Canons
1603, 1640. and many of those past in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
time (though not so easie to be seen) doth at full appear.
Which said we may have leisure to consider of another
passage relating not unto the power of the Church, but
the wealth of the Churchmen. Of which thus our Autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 253. <hi>I have heard</hi> (saith he) <hi>that</hi> Queen Elizabeth
<hi>being informed that</hi> Dr. Pilkington Bishop <hi>of</hi> Durham <hi>had
given ten thousand pounds in marriage with his Daughter;
and being offended that a Prelates daughter should equal a
Princesse in portion, took away one thousand pounds a year from
that Bishoprick, and assigned it for the better maintenance of
the Garrison of</hi> Barwick.] In telling of which story ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For first to justifie the Queens displeasure (if she were
displeased) he makes the Bishop richer, and the Portion
greater then indeed they were. The ten thousand pounds
<hi>Lib. 9. fol.</hi> 109. being shrunk to eight; and that eight
thousand pound not given to one Daughter (as is here
affirmed) but divided equally between two: whereof the
one was married to Sir <hi>Iames Harrington,</hi> the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Dunch</hi> of <hi>Berk-shire.</hi> Secondly, this could be no cause of
the Queens displeasure, and much lesse of the Cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

envy; that Bishop having sat in the See of <hi>Durham</hi>
above seventeen years. And certainly he must needs have
been a very <hi>ill Husband</hi> if our of such a great Revenue he
had not saved five hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to prefe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
his Children; the income being as great, and the charges
of Hospitality lesse then they have been since. Thirdly,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61619:70"/>
the Queen did not take away a thousand pound a year
from that Bishoprick, as is here affirmed. The Lands
were left to it as before, but in regard the Garrison of
<hi>Barwick</hi> preserved the Bishops Lands and Tenants from
the spoil of the <hi>Scots;</hi> the Queen thought fit, that the
Bishops should contribute towards their own defence,
imposing on them an annuall pension of a thousand pound
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="124"/> for the better maintaining of that Garrison. Fourthly,
Bishop <hi>Pilkington</hi> was no <hi>Doctor,</hi> but a Batchelor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
only; and possibly had not been raised by our
Author to an higher Title and Degree then the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
had given him, but that he was a <hi>Conniver at Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity,</hi>
as our Author telleth us <hi>Lib. 9. fol.</hi> 109.
Lastly, I shall here add that I conceive the Pension above
mentioned not to have been laid upon that See after
<hi>Pilkingtons</hi> death, but on his first preferment to it, the
<hi>French</hi> having then newly landed some forces in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
which put the Queen upon a necessity of doubling her
Gua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ds and increasing her Garrisons. But whatsoever was
the cause of imposing this great yearly payment upon
that Bishoprick, certain I am, that it continued and
the money was duly paid into the Exchequer for many
years, after the true cause thereof was taken away; the
Queens displeasure against <hi>Pilkington</hi> ending either with
his life or hers, and all the Garrisons and forces upon
the Borders being taken away in the beginning of the
Reign of King <hi>Iames.</hi> So true is that old saying, <hi>Quod
Christus non capit fiscus rapit,</hi> never more fully verified
then in this particular.</p>

the</hi> Ark, <hi>yea a</hi> Cain <hi>amongst the</hi> four Primitive Persons
<hi>in the beginning of the world.</hi>] In this, our Authors Rule
is better then his Exemplification. For though there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="129"/> where but eight persons in the <hi>Ark,</hi> whereof <hi>Cham</hi> was
one, yet in all probability there were more then <hi>four
persons</hi> in the world at the Birth of <hi>Abel,</hi> reckoning him
for one. For though the Scripture doth subjoyn the
Birth of <hi>Abel</hi> unto that of <hi>Cain,</hi> yet was it rather in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the following story wherein <hi>Abel</hi> was a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
party, then that no other children had been born
between them. The world had peopled very slowly,
and never increased to such vast multitudes in so short a
time, if <hi>Eve</hi> had not twinned at least at every birth, and
that some other children had not intervened between
<hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel.</hi> Not was <hi>Cain</hi> in relation to the time
of his brothers birth to be accounted of as <hi>Cain</hi> in our
Authors sense, that is to say, a Malefactor, an <hi>Offender,</hi> a
murtherer of his innocent brother; or if we take him
in that sense, there must be then some scores of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
at the least, if not many hundreds, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no such <hi>Cain amongst the Four Primitive Persons in the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="130"/> with the Capitular Bodies, Schools, Alms-houses and
other Ministers and Officers subservient to them, is to be
thought <hi>a worthy work</hi> (with reference to the work it

use which the unhappiness of this Age hath put them to,
that is to say, by selling all the Lands which severally

of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as our Author telleth us. Assuredly

<hi>without assigning them any allowance for their subsistence.</hi>]
Our Author says very well in this, there being few <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
persons</hi> thrust out of their Houses, (except those
that suffered by the first act of dissolution) who either
were not prefer'd in the Church, (as <hi>Wakeman</hi> the last

pension, according to their age, wants, and quality;
insomuch as Sir <hi>William Weston</hi> Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> of the order
of St. <hi>Iohns,</hi> had an yearly Pension of a thousand pounds;
<hi>Rawson</hi> the <hi>Subprior</hi> of a thousand Marks, some of the
Brethren of two hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and thirty
pounds <hi>per annum</hi> he that had least. Not did the King
only give them such competent Pensions as might yeeld
them a subsistence for the future, but furnisht them with
ready money beforehand (their <hi>viaticum</hi> or advance mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

which commonly amounted to a fourth part of their year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the instruction (I will not say the reproach) of the present
times, in which so many Bishops, Deans, and Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries

have been thrust out of their Cathedrals without
the allowance of one penny towards their subsistence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The like may be said also in the case of the sequestred
Clergy. For though by an Order of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
their wives<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the yearly profits of their Benefices, yet the <hi>unconsci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
Intruders</hi> found so many shifts to evade that Order,
that very few enjoy'd the just benefit of it, and they that
did, found their attendance on the <hi>Committee for plundred

it did hardly quit the cost. One man I know particularly,

a chargeable stay in <hi>London</hi> to attend the business;
was fain at last to make a private agreement with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
party, and take a <hi>tenth</hi> part in stead of a <hi>fifth.</hi> The like
may be said also of the late <hi>Bill,</hi> by which the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian

Clergy for term of life. For though it be thereby provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the Commissioners <hi>for rejecting of scandalous

Clergy; yet is the Bill clog'd with two such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
as make it altogether unuseful to some, and may
make it little beneficial unto all the rest. For by the first
it is declar'd, that no man shall receive any benefit by it,
who hath either thirty pound <hi>per annum</hi> in <hi>Real,</hi> or five
hundred pounds in <hi>Personal Estate;</hi> by means whereof
many who have had some hundreds of pounds yearly to
maintain their Families, are tyed up to so poor a pittance
as will hardly keep their chil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ren from begging in the
open streets. By the other, there is such a power given
to the Commissioners, that <hi>not exceeding the fifth part,</hi> they
may give to the poor sequestred Clergy as much and as
little as they please, under that proportion. And one I
know particularly in this case also, who for an Arrear of
twelve years out of a Benefice rented formerly at 250 <hi>l.
per annum,</hi> to my certain knowledge could obtain but
3 <hi>l. 6 s. 8 d.</hi> (the first <hi>Intruder</hi> being still living, and possest
of that Benefice) and no more then 20 Marks <hi>par annum</hi>
for his future subsistence, which is but a <hi>nineteenth</hi> part in
stead of a <hi>fifth.</hi> And this I have observ'd the rather, that
if these p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>pers should chance to come into the hands of
any of those who have the conduct of affairs, they would
be pleas'd to cause the said Bill to be review'd, and make
the benefit thereof more <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>extensive</hi> then it is at
the present. Our Author might have sav'd me the
greatest part of this <hi>Application,</hi> had he been minded to
do the poor Clergy any right, as he seldom doth. For
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61619:74"/>
proof whereof we need but look upon a passage in his
very Book, <hi>fol.</hi> 283. which is this that followeth. <q>Once
(saith he) it was in my minde to set down a Catalogue
(easie to do, and useful when done) of such <hi>Houses</hi> of
<hi>Cistercians, Templers,</hi> and <hi>Hospitallers,</hi> which were
founded since the <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> yet going under the
general notion of <hi>Tithe-free,</hi> to the great injury of the
Church. But since on <hi>second thoughts,</hi> I conceived it
better to let it alone, as not sure on such <hi>discovery</hi> of
any <hi>blessing</hi> from such <hi>Ministers</hi> which should gain, but
certain of many <hi>curses</hi> from such <hi>Lay-men</hi> who should
lose thereby.</q> So he. But I have heard it for a usual saying
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> That <hi>he that feared
the Popes curse, the reproaches of discontented people, and the
frowns of his Mistress, should never sleep a quiet hour in his
bed.</hi> And so much for that.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 357. <hi>But this was done without any great cost to the</hi>
Crown, <hi>only by altering the</hi> Property of the place <hi>from a</hi>

this of the Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> which though it suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many changes, yet had it no such change as our Author
speaks of; that is to say, from a Cathedral to an Abbey,
without any other alteration which came in between. For
when the Monastery was dissolved by King <hi>Henry</hi> the
<hi>eighth, An.</hi> 1539. it was made a Deanry, <hi>Will. Benson</hi> being
the first Dean. In the year 1541. he made it an Episcopal
See, or <hi>Cathedral</hi> Church, and placed <hi>Thomas Thurlby</hi>
the first Bishop there. But <hi>Thurlby</hi> being remov'd to
<hi>Norwich, Anno</hi> 1550. the Bishoprick was suppressed by
King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, and the Church ceased from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Cathedral, continuing as a Deanry only till the 21.
of <hi>November,</hi> 1557. at what time <hi>Dr. Hugh Weston</hi>

the primogeniture of their Princes, but on the Statute
of Succession, and then the object of that Loyalty must
not be the King, but the Act of Parliament, by which
they were directed to the knowledge of the next suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor:
and then it must needs be in the power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
to dispose of the Kingdom as they pleas'd; the
Peoples Loyalty being tyed to such dispositions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that the Statutes of Succession had been so many,
and so contrary to one another, that the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
could not readily tell which to trust to; and for the
last it related to the Kings last Will and Testament, so
lately made and known unto so few of the Commons,
that they had neither opportunity to see it, nor time to
con the same by heart. Nor thirdly, were the <hi>Commons</hi>
so perfect in this lesson of Loyalty, or had so fixt it in
their hearts, but that they were willing to forget it

within little time, and take out such new lessons of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
and disloyalty, as <hi>Wiat</hi> and his Partizans did
preach unto them. And finally they had not so well conn'd
this lesson of Loyalty in our Authors own judgement, but
that some strong pretender might have taught them a
new Art of Oblivion: it being no improbable thing (as
himself confesseth) <hi>to have heard of a King Henry the ninth,</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="144"/> I cannot finde that the Convocation at this
time, nor many years before this time, was commonly
reputed as a part of the Parliament. That antiently it
had been so, I shall easily grant; there being a clause in
every letter of Summons by which the Bishops were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to attend in Parliament, that they should warn the
Clergy of their several and respective Dioceses, some in
their persons, and others by their Procurators to attend
there also. But this hath been so long unpractic'd, that
we finde no track of foot-steps of it since the Parliaments
of the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second. It's true indeed,
that in the 8. year of <hi>King Henry</hi> the <hi>sixth,</hi> there passed
a Statute by which it was enacted, <q>That all the Clergy

they omitted both as superfluous and superstitious. Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,</hi>
and <hi>superstitious,</hi> in whose opinion? In that of

alike. Most probably in our Authors as well as theirs,

<hi>such as they thought, they judg'd, or they suppos'd them:</hi>

makes me inclinable to believe that the Letany, Surplice,

in our Authors judgement, not in theirs alone. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
our Author (as we have noted formerly on the

used and required to be used by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
among the <hi>superstitious Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>such like
Trinckets with which that Sacrament is loaded.</hi> And if he
durst declare himself so plain in this second Book written
as he affirms, in the Reign of the late King, when he
might fear to be call'd to an account for that expression,
there is little question to be made, but <hi>since Monarchy
was turn'd into a State,</hi> he would give his pen more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
then he did before, in counting the <hi>Letany, Surplice,</hi>

                     <hi>Cross in Baptism.</hi> Thirdly, having laid down an abstract
of the form of worship contriv'd by the <hi>Schismaticks</hi> at
<hi>Franckford,</hi> he honoreth them with no lower Title then
that of Saints; and counts this liberty of deviating from
the Rules of the <hi>Church</hi> for a part of their happiness.
For so it followeth, fol. 28. <hi>This,</hi> saith he, <hi>is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of</hi> Saints, <hi>who never account themselves peaceably
possest of any</hi> happiness, <hi>untill (if it be in their power) they
have also made their fellow-sufferers partakers thereof.</hi> If
those be <hi>Saints,</hi> who separate themselves schismatically
from their Mother Church; and if it be a happiness to
them to be permitted so to do; our Author hath all the
reason in the world to desire to be admitted into their
<hi>Communion,</hi> and be made partaker of that happiness
which such <hi>Saints</hi> enjoy. And if in order thereunto he
counts the Letany, Surplice, and other Ceremonies of the
Church to be both superstitious and superfluous too, who
can blame him for it?</p>

not so much because her Reign was long, but because
it was a busie Age and full of Faction. To which Faction

in order to the great work of Reformation, <hi>fell
beforehand to the beating down of superstitious</hi> Pictures

indiscretion herein, yet our Author will not, but rather
gives these Reasons for their justification; 1. That the
Popish Religion is Idolatry. 2. That Idolatry is to
be destroyed by all that have power to do it. 3. (Which
is indeed the main) that if the <hi>Soveraigns</hi> do forget,
there is no reason but <hi>Subjects</hi> should remember their
duty. This being our Authors Master-piece, and a fair

<hi>Romish</hi> Religion is Idolatry, though possible it is that
some of the members of that Church may be proved
Idolaters. I know well what great pains Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi>

                  <p>2. That Idolatry is to be destroyed by all them that

to the liberty of unlawful violence. <hi>Id possumus,

in all attempts for Reformation in the elder times. For
when the Fabrick of the Jewish Church was out of

with superstitions, or intermingled with Idolatries,
as it was too often: did not Gods servants carry and
await his leisure, till those who were supreme both in

the presence of their Bishop might not be a hinderance
unto their designs, they rais'd a tumult, put themselves
in to a posture of war, and thereby force him and his
Clergy to forsake the City. And this being done, they
did not only order matters of Religion as they pleas'd

and set up a new form of Discipline,
ingrossing that power unto the <hi>Kirk,</hi> which
formerly had been usurped by the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
when the Queen was return'd into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
that some of their importunate Petitions were neglected
by her, it was concluded by the Ministers in as plain
terms as might be, that <hi>if the Queen will not, then we
must,</hi> ibid. fol. 33.</p>
                  <p>According to this Rule the <hi>Netherlands</hi> proceeded
also, not only driving on the design which they had in
hand (as the <hi>French Hugonots</hi> also did) without the
Kings Authority, but against it also. Finally, from a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
practical it came at last to be delivered for a point of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61619:87"/>
Doctrine, that if the Prince or Supreme Magistrate did
not reform the Church, then the people might. For
this I finde in <hi>Clesselius,</hi> one of the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi>
of <hi>Roterdam.</hi> If saith he, the Prince and Clergy do neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
their duties in the Reforming of the Church, <hi>Necesse

to the common people. And it is with a <hi>Necesse</hi>
too, if you mark it well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might not only do it, but
they must be doing. Not in the way of Mediation or
Petition, by which the dignity of the Magistrate might
be preserv'd, but by force and violence, <hi>Licet ad san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem

the same Doctrine, whether by way of Application
or Instruction, it comes all to one; for, <hi>Qui Parentes
laudat filios provocat,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius</hi> has it, Posterity is
too soon taught to follow the ill examples of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.

did, yet when the gap is once set open, and the
Hedge of Authority torn down, bloodshed and war,
and other acts of open violence will come in of course.
So that we may affirm of this dangerous Doctrine, as
the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> once did of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> viz. <hi>Videtur in
negotio sidei periculosa, pacis Ecclesiae perturbativa, &amp;
magis ad destructionem quàm ad aedificationem.</hi> But I have
staid too long upon these first Notes, I now proceed
unto the rest.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 54. <hi>This Parliament being very active in matters
of Religion, the Convocation (younger Brother thereunto)
was little employed and less regarded.</hi>] Our Author fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
his design of putting matters of Religion into the
power of <hi>Parliaments</hi> though he hath chosen a very ill
<hi>Medium</hi> to conclude the point. This Parliament as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="154"/>
active as he seems to make it, troubled it self so little
with matters of Religion, that had it done less, it had
done just nothing. All that it did, was the Repealing of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61619:88"/>
some Acts made in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and
setling matters in the same State in which she found them
at her first coming to the Crown. The Common Prayer
Book being reviewed and fitted to the use of the Church
by some godly men, appointed by the Queen alone,
receiv'd no other confirmation in this present Parliament
then what it had before in the last years of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
The Supremacy was again restor'd, as it had been
formerly; the Title of Supreme head which seem'd of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
unto many of both Religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that of Supreme Governor, nothing, in all this done <hi>de
novo,</hi>
which could entitle this Parliament to such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
in matters of Religion, but that our Author had a
minde to undervalue the <hi>Convocation,</hi> as being <hi>little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
and less regarded.</hi> I grant indeed, that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi>
of that year did only meet for forms sake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
acting any thing; and there was very good reason
for it. The Bishops at that time were so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enaciously ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they chose all (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Anthony Kitchin</hi> of <hi>Landaffe</hi>) rather to lose their
Bishopricks then take the Oath of Supremacy. So that
there was little or no hope of doing any thing in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi>
to the Queens content in order to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Religion, which was then design'd, had they
been suffered to debate, treat, and conclude of such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
as had relation thereunto. But we shall see when
things are somewhat better setled, that the activity of
the next <hi>Convocation</hi> will make amends for the silence and
unsignificancy of this.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I would fain know our Authors Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why speaking of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> and the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>

Convocations in the Church of <hi>England</hi> some hundreds of
years before the name of Parliament had been ever heard
of; which he that lists to read the collection of Councils

an Act for the Restitution in bloud of the children
of <hi>Thomas Cranmer</hi> late Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for
which our Author as it seems can see no reason, in
regard he was <hi>condemned and died only for Heresie. For
though</hi> (saith he) <hi>this Archbishop was first accused of High-Treason,
yet it afterward was waved, and he tryed upon
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="158"/> Heretical opinions</hi> But in this our Author is mistaken.
For though <hi>Cranmer</hi> was condemned and died for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
yet he was not condemned for that only; nor
was the accusation for Treason wav'd, as he saith it was,
but the conviction of him as an Heretick superadded to
it. Being accused of High-Treason for subscribing
(though unwillingly) to the Proclamation of the Lady
<hi>Iane,</hi> he was committed to the Tower on
the 15. of <hi>September,</hi>

                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:61619:89"/>
thought good to wave her first proceeding, and to have
him put to death for Heresie. But the <hi>Attainder</hi> holding
still good at the Common-Law, there was great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why his Children should desire a restitution in bloud,
not otherwise to be obtained but by Act of Parliament.
And so without troubling the <hi>learned in the Law</hi>
for our <hi>information,</hi> I hope our Author will be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and save his Fee for other more necessary
uses.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 72. <hi>In the Convocation now sitting, the nine and
thirty Articles were composed, agreeing for the main with
those set forth in the Reign of King</hi> Edward <hi>the sixth,
though in some particulars allowing more liberty to dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
judgements.</hi>] This is the active Convocation which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="159"/>
before I spake of, not setling matters of Religion in
the same estate in which they were left by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi>
but altering some Articles, expunging others,
addingsome <hi>de novo,</hi> and fitting the whole body of them
unto edification; <hi>Not leaving any liberty to dissenting
Iudgments,</hi> as our Author would have it, but binding
men unto the literal and Grammatical sense. They had
not othewise attained to the end they aimed at which
was <hi>ad tollendam opinionum dissensionem, &amp; consensum in
vera Religione firmandum;</hi> that is to say, to take away
diversity of Opinions, and to establish an agreement
in the true Religion. Which end could never be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
if men were left unto the <hi>liberty of dissenting,</hi>
or might have leave to put their own sense upon the
Articles. But whereas our Author instances in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="160"/>
                     <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Christs descent into Hell,</hi> telling us that <hi>Christs
preaching unto the Spirits there</hi> (on which the Article
seemed to be grounded in King <hi>Edwards</hi> Book) was
left out in this; and thereupon inferreth that men are
left unto a <hi>latitude concerning the cause, time, manner of
his descent;</hi> I must needs say, that he is very much mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
For first the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61619:90"/>
maintained a <hi>locall Descent,</hi> though many which
would be thought her Children, the better to comply
with <hi>Calvin</hi> and some other Divines of forain Nations,
have deviated in this point from the sense of the
Church. And secondly, the reason why this Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
left out that passage of Christ preaching to the
Spirits in hell; was not that men might be left unto
a <hi>latitude</hi> concerning the <hi>cause, time,</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of his
<hi>Descent,</hi> as our Author dreams; but because that passage
of St. <hi>Peter</hi> being capable of some other interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
was not conceived to be a clear and sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to prove the Article. For which see Bishop <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 388, 389.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 74. <hi>In a word, concerning this clause whether the
Bishops were faulty in their addition, or their opposites in
their substraction, I leave to more cunning Arithmeticians
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="161"/> to decide.</hi>] The Clause here spoken of by our Author is
the first Sentence in the <hi>twentieth Article</hi> entituled <hi>De
Ecclesiae Authoritate,</hi> where it is said that the <hi>Church
hath power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and Authority
in Controversies of the Faith.</hi> Which being charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Bishops as a late addition, the better to support
their power and maintain their Tyranny; the late
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in his Speech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the <hi>Star-Chamber,
Iune</hi> the 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1637. made it appear that the
said Clause was in a Printed Book of Articles published
in the year 1563. being but very few moneths after
they had passed in the Convocation, which was on
the 29. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1562. in the <hi>English</hi> account. And
more then so, he shewed unto the Lords a Copy of
the twentieth Article exemplified out of the Records,
and attested by the hands of a publick Notary, in which
that very Clause was found, which had been charged
upon the Bishops for an innovation. And thus much I
can say of mine own knowledge, that having occasion
to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>t the Records of Convocation, I found this
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61619:90"/>
controverted Clause <hi>verbatim</hi> in these following words,
<hi>Habet Ecclesia Ritus statuendo jus, &amp; in fidei Controversis
Authoritatem.</hi> Which makes me wonder at our Author,
that having access to those Records, and making frequent
use of them in this present History, he should declare
himself unable to decide the doubt, whether the <hi>addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of this Clause was <hi>made by the Bishops,</hi> or the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction</hi>
of it by the <hi>opposite party.</hi> But <hi>none so blinde as
he that will not see,</hi> saies the good old proverb.</p>
                  <p>But our Author will not so give over. He must first
have a fling at the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> upon this
occasion. In the year 1571. (the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
then to grow very strong) the Articles were
again Printed both in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> and this Clause
left out; publisht according to those copies in the
<hi>Harmony of Confessions</hi> Printed at <hi>Geneva, Anno</hi> 1612.
and publisht by the same at <hi>Oxford</hi> (though soon after
rectified) <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. Now the Archbishop taking notice
of the first alteration, <hi>Anno</hi> 1571. declares
in his said Speech, that it was no <hi>hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
for that opposite Faction to have the
Articles Printed and this clause left out,<note place="margin">Archbishops Speech, p. 71.</note>
considering <hi>who they were that then governed businesses
and rid the Church almost at their pleasure.</hi> What says our
Author to this? Marry, saith he, <hi>I am not so well skilled
in Historical Horsemanship as to know whom his Grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for the Rider of the Church at that time,</hi> fol. 74.
Strange that a man who undertakes to write an History <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="162"/>
should professe himself ignorant of the names of those
who <hi>governed the businesse of the times</hi> he writes of. But
this is only an affected ignorance, profest of purpose
to preserve the honour of some men whom he beholds

before <hi>Christmas</hi> then next following, in
the presence of his Diocesan Bishop testifie his assent, and
subscribe to the said Articles of the year 1562.
Secondly, that after such subscribing before the Bishop
he should on some Sunday in the forenoon in the
Church or Chappel where he served, in time of Divine
Service read openly the said Articles on pain of being
deprived of all his Ecclesiastical promotions, as if he
were then naturally dead. Thirdly, that if any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
person should maintain any Doctrine contrary
to any of the said Articles, and being convented by
his Bishop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should persist therein, it should be
just cause to deprive such person of his Ecclesiastical
promotions. Fourthly, that all persons to be admitted
to any Benefice with Cure, should likewise subscribe
to the said Articles, and publickly read the same in the
open Church within two moneths after their inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

care expressed for reformation of such disorders as were
like to rise amongst the Ministers of the Church, by
requiring their subscription and assent unto them under
such temporal punishments, which at that time the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the Church had not laid upon them. So that our
Author very well might have spared this Flourish, that
the Obligatoriness of these Articles as to temporal
punishments <hi>beares not date nine years before, from their
composition in Convocation, but henceforward from their
confirmation in Parliament.</hi> And here I must crave leave

He had not else left it as a matter doubtful, whether the
disturbances which insued on the Archbishops inforcing
of Subscription, and the scandal which did thence arise,
were to be imputed to the Imposer who had Authority
on his side (as himself confesseth) or the refusers, carried
on by self ends and untractable obstinacy. As for the

                  <p>All which being so expresly built on the Lawes of

had no reason to examine punctually the truth of that
which tended so apparently to the great advantage of

false cannot be used to justifie our Author in many

And he that knowing a thing to be false, sets it down
for true, not only gives the lie to his own consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

<hi>Scripturarum ars est quam omnes passim sibi vindicant,</hi>
as St. <hi>Ierom</hi> complained in his time. Let every Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
be a Preacher, and step from the shop-board to

a making of Ministers in such a sense as <hi>Phoebe</hi> is
said to be a Minister of the Church of <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to the necessities of their Congregations. But
to ascribe unto them a power of Ordination or of
giving Orders which they assume not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
savours too strong of the party, and contradicts
the general Rules of the ancient Fathers. At this time
I content my self with that saying of <hi>Ierom,</hi> because
esteemed no friend to Bishops, <hi>viz. Quid facit

with a merry tale (though but one for an hundred)
and tis a tale of an old jolly popish Priest, who having
no entertainment for a friend who came to him on a
Fasting day, but a piece of Pork, and making consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of observing the appointed Fast, dipt it into a
<hi>tub</hi> of water, saying <hi>down Porke up Pike.</hi> Satisfied with
which device (as being accustomed to <hi>transubstantiate,</hi>
he well might be) he caused it to be put into the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and made ready for dinner. But as the Pork for all
this suddain piece of wit, was no other then Pork;
so these good fellowes of the Presbytery by laying
hands upon one another, act as little as he: the parties
so <hi>impos'd</hi> upon (<hi>impos'd</hi> upon indeed in the proper no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
are but as they were, Lay-brethren of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
stamp, Ministers if you will, but not Priests nor
Deacons, nor any wayes Canonically enabled for

divine performances. But fearing to be chidden for his
levity, I knock off again, following my Author as he
leads me; who being <hi>over shooes,</hi> will be <hi>over boots</hi> also.
He is so lost to the <hi>High Royalist</hi> and <hi>covetous</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist,
that he cannot be in a worse case (with them)
then he is already. And therefore having declared
himself for a Presbyterian in point of Government, he
will go thorough with his work, shewing himself a

Dr. <hi>Bounds</hi> book published <hi>Anno</hi> 1595. in which the

that <hi>learned men were much divided in their judgements
about the same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fol. 228. <hi>Some</hi> (saith he) <hi>embraced them as ancient
truths consonant to Scripture, long disused and neglected,

For that he doth approve <hi>Bounds</hi> Doctrines in this
particular, appears;</p>
                  <p>First, By a passage, <hi>fol.</hi> 165. where he con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nts with

at <hi>Paris-Garden</hi> on the <hi>Lords-day, Anno</hi> 1583. for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
judgement upon those who perished by it, as they
were beholding that rude pastime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, By his censure of the proceedings of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi>
Whitgift <hi>against these Doctrines, of whom he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us, fol</hi> 229. That his known opposition to the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Brethren, rendred his actions more odious, as
if out of envy he had caused such a pearl to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.</p>

                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:61619:98"/>
Thirdly, by making these Sabbath Doctrines to be
the <hi>Diamond in the Ring,</hi> of those Catechisms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
which afterwards were set out by the <hi>stricter
Divines.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by the sadnesse which he findes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting

                  <p>But leaving him to stand or fall to his own Master,
I would fain know what text of Scripture, ancient
Writer, or approved Councel can be brought to justifie
<hi>Bounds</hi> Doctrines which he affirms for <hi>ancient truths</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="184"/>
and <hi>consonant</hi> to holy <hi>Scripture.</hi> But more particularly
where he can shew me any ground for the third Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>there is as great reason why we Christians
should take our selves as straightly bound to rest upon the
Lords day as the</hi> Jewes <hi>were upon their Sabbath; it being
one of the moral Commandements, whereof all are of equall
authority.</hi> This if it be a truth is no ancient truth; and
whensoever it be received and allowed for truth, will
in conclusion lay as heavy and insupportable Burthens
upon the consciences of Gods people as ever were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon the Jewes by the Scribes and Pharisees. And
secondly, I would fain know the meaning of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words, in which it is said, that <hi>others conceived
them grounded on a wrong bottom, but because they tended to
the manifest advance of Religion, it was pity to oppose them.</hi>
I would fain know I say, considering that the foundation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="185"/>
of the Christian faith is laid on the Doctrine of the
Prophets and Apostles, Christ himself being the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
stone; how any thing which is not built upon this
foundation, but <hi>grounded on a wrong bottom</hi> (as this see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be) <hi>could tend to the manifest advance of</hi> the true
<hi>Religion.</hi> That it tended to the manifest advance of
some Religion I shall easily grant; and if our Author
mean no otherwise, we shall soon agree. But sure I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61619:99"/>
am, no part of the <hi>true Religion</hi> was ever grounded upon

called the Nine Articles of <hi>Lambeth</hi>) were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon, and sent down to <hi>Cambridge</hi> in favour of
Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> and his Associates. But our Author not
content to relate the story of the Quarrel, must take
upon him also to be a judge in the Controversie. He
had before commended the <hi>Dominicans</hi> for their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="188"/>
in these points of Doctrine as they were then
in agitation betwixt them and the <hi>Iesuits.</hi> He now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to do the like between the two parties (men of
great piety and learning appearing in it on both sides)
disputing the same points in the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
honouring the opinion of Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> and his Associates
with the name of the <hi>truth;</hi> and branding the other with
the Title of the <hi>opposite error.</hi> And yet not thinking that
he had declared himself sufficiently in the favour of
the Calvinian party, he telleth us not long after of these
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61619:100"/>
                     <hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles, <hi>fol.</hi> 232. that <hi>though they wanted the
Authority of Provincial Acts, yet will they readily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of all Orthodox Christians for as far as their own puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
bears conformity to Gods word.</hi> Which last words
(though somewhat perplextly laid down) must either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
their <hi>conformity</hi> to the <hi>word of God,</hi> or else signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
nothing. But whatsoever opinion our Author hath
of these Nine Articles, certain it is that Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
was much displeased at the making of them, and
commanded them to be supprest, which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly;
and with such diligence withall, that for long time

                  <p>THE Puritan clamors being hush'd, and the Papists
giving themselves some hopes of better dayes,
afforded King <hi>Iames</hi> a quiet entrance to the
Crown. But scarce was he warm upon the Throne, but
the Puritans assaulted him with their Petitions, and some
of the Papists finding their hopes began to fail them,
turned their private discontents into open practices, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to settle their Religion by the destruction of
the King, and the change of Government. And first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with the Papists, because first in time.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 5. Watson <hi>with</hi> William Clark <hi>(another of his

it to</hi> George Brooks.] To these he after adds the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61619:103"/>
Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> a Protestant, the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Whaddon</hi> a
Puritan, and Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> an able Statesman, and
some other Knights. In the recital of which names our
Author hath committed a double fault, the one of omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the other of commission. A fault of omission in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="194"/> leaving out Sir <hi>Griffith Markham,</hi> as much concerned as
any of the principal actors, design'd to have been <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of Estate,</hi> had the Plot succeeded, and finally arraign'd
and condemn'd at <hi>Winchester,</hi> as the others were. His
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="195"/> fault of commission is, his calling the <hi>Lord Gray</hi> by the
name of the <hi>Lord Gray</hi> of <hi>Whaddon</hi> (a fault not easily to
be pardon'd in so great an Herald) whereas indeed though
<hi>Whaddon</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamshire</hi> was part of his Estate, yet
<hi>Wilton</hi> in <hi>Herefordshire</hi> was his <hi>Barony</hi> and ant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Ancestors being call'd <hi>LL. Gray</hi> of <hi>Wilton,</hi> to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
them from the <hi>Lord Gray</hi> of <hi>Reuthen,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray</hi>
of <hi>Codnor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Having thus satisfied our Author in this particular, I
would gladly satisfie my self in some others concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Treason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which I finde so many persons of
such different humors, and Religions, that it is very hard
to think how they could either mingle their interefles, or
unite their counsels. But discontentments make men fuel
fit for any fire, and discontents had been on purpose put
upon some of them, the more to estrange them from the
King, and the King from them. And though I am not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="196"/>
                     <hi>Oedipus</hi> enough for so dark a <hi>Sphinx,</hi> yet others who
have had more light into the businesses of that time,
have made their discontents to grow upon this occasion;
Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi> then principal Secretary to the Estate,
fearing the great abilities of <hi>Rawleigh,</hi> and being wearied
with the troublesome impertinencies of <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
all which had joyned with him in design against
the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> their common Enemy; had done their
errand to <hi>Kings Iames</hi> (whose counsels he desired to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross
to himself alone) before his coming into <hi>England.</hi>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:61619:103"/>
And the Plot took so good effect, that when the Lord
<hi>Cobham</hi> went to meet the King as he came towards <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
the King checked him (being then Warden of
the Cinqne Ports) for his absence from his charge in
that dangerous time. The <hi>Lord Gray,</hi> was not look'd
upon in the Court, as he had been formerly, there being
no longer use of his rashness and praecipitations. And
the better to discountenance <hi>Rawleigh,</hi> who had been
Captain of the Guard to <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
that Office on Sir <hi>Thomas Erskin,</hi> then Vicount

of which the last was his brother, and the first his

in laying before them their disgraces, and shewing them
a way to right themselves, to draw them into the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
with <hi>Clark</hi> and <hi>Watson.</hi> And it is possible, that
they not being substantive enough to stand alone, might
acquaint <hi>Rawleigh</hi> with the Plot, whose head was able
to do more then all their hands. But of his actings in it,
or consenting to it, when the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their Tryal, there appear'd no proof, but that <hi>Cobham</hi> in
his confession taken before the Lords had accus'd him of
it; and that not only as an accessary, but a principal
actor. But <hi>Cobham</hi> not being brought into the open
Court to justifie his accusation face to face, as the custom
as, it was thought a good argument by many, that <hi>Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>
was not so criminal in this matter as his Enemies
made him. And though found guilty by the Jury on no
other evidence, then a branch of <hi>Cobhams,</hi> confession,
not so much as subscribed by his hand, yet all men were
not satisfied in the manner of this proceeding: it being
then commonly affirm'd that <hi>Cobham</hi> had retracted his
accusation, as since it hath been said and printed, that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="201"/> to receive the same.</hi>] Our Author speaks this on occasion
of a Statute made in the first Parliament of <hi>King Iam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

by which the King and his Successors were made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of receiving any Grants or Leases of Lands,
from any Archbishops, or Bishops, for longer then 21
years, or three lives. But he is much mistaken in the
grounds of it. For first the Statute he relates unto, was not
made in the thirteenth year of the <hi>Queen,</hi> that Statute
extending only unto Deans and Chapters, Masters of
Colledges and Hospitals, as also unto Parsons and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars,
who by long Leases had dilapidated the publick
Patrimony of the Church, and their several Houses, Not
a word in it, which concerns Archbishops and Bishops,
or any Leases by them made. And secondly, that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

whatsoever it be, doth not disable all Subjects from
accepting such Leases, Grants, and Alienations, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth
the said Archbishops, and Bishops, from making
such Grants unto the Subjects. But the truth is, that
Statute which our Author means, is an unprinted Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
made in the first year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> By which
it was enacted, That it should be lawful for the said
Queen, as often as any Archbishoprick or Bishoprick
should be vacant, to take unto herself any of the Castles,
Mannors, Lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

enacted in the said unprinted Statute, that it should not
be lawful for any Archbishop, or Bishop, to grant any
Lands, Leases, or Estates for more then 21 years, or three

having procur'd a grant of all the batable grounds, as

began to cast his eye upon <hi>Norham-Castle</hi> and the
Lands about it, belonging to the See of <hi>Durham,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it a fit place to command the rest. But being a
well principled man, and a great Minister of that Kings,
in restoring the Episcopal Government to the Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he acquainted Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
who knowing what great use might be made of
him for the good of this Church, and being sure enough
of the consent of Dr. <hi>Matthews,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi>
he thus ordered the business. Whereas the Revenue of
<hi>Norham-Castle,</hi> and the lands adjoyning were valued at
one hundred twenty pounds <hi>per annum</hi> in the Bishops
Rental, it was agreed that the Earl should procure of
the King an abatement of sixscore pounds yearly out of
the annual pension of a thousand pound which had been
said upon that Bishoprick by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as before
is said. Secondly, that he should obtain from the King
for the said <hi>Dr. Matthews,</hi> and his Successors a restitution
of his House in the <hi>Strand</hi> called <hi>Durham-House,</hi> with the
Gardens, Stables, and Tenements thereto appertaining,
which had been alienated from that Bishoprick ever since
the dissolving of it by <hi>King Edward</hi> the <hi>sixth.</hi> Thirdly,
that in consideration hereof <hi>Bishop Matthews</hi> should make
a grant of <hi>Norham-Castle,</hi> and the Countrey adjoyning in

being thus serv'd, the said Earl should joyn with Bishop

an Act of Parliament, whereby both he and his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors

I would only have added two words which would have
cleared all: for after I had told as a Divine, what
was due by the Subjects to their Kings in general,
I would then have concluded as an <hi>English</hi> man,
shewing this people, that as in general all sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the doctrine of the Bishop being thus justified and

Anno</hi> 1614. and this Book coming out about two years
after, <hi>Anno</hi> 1616. But here I shall observe in the first
place our Authors <hi>partiality,</hi> in telling us that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in that book hath <hi>proved Historically that Tithes are paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> humano, <hi>and not otherwise;</hi> whereas indeed he
undertook to prove that point, but proved it not; as
will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ppear to any which have read the Answers set out
against him. I observe secondly, our Authors <hi>ignorance</hi>
in the Book it self, telling us within few lines after, that
<hi>the first part of it is a meer Iew, of the practice of Tithing
amongst the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>the second a</hi> Christian, <hi>and chiefly an</hi>
English man; whereas indeed that part thereof which
precedes the manner of Tithing amongst Christians, hath
as much of the <hi>Gentil</hi> as of the <hi>Iew,</hi> as much time spent
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61619:109"/>
upon examining of the Tithes paid by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Romans,</hi> as was in that amongst the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Thirdly,
I must observe the prejudice which he hath put upon the
Cause, by telling us in the next place, that <hi>though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Divines undertook the Answer of that Book, yet sure
it is, that never</hi> a fiercer storm <hi>fell on all</hi> Parsonage Barn;
<hi>since the Reformation, then what this</hi> Treatise <hi>raised up.</hi>
And so our Author leaves this matter without more
ado, telling us of the Churches <hi>danger,</hi> but not
acquainting us at all with her deliverance from
the present <hi>storm;</hi> neither so violent, not so great, nor
of such continuance, as to blow off any one Tile, or to
blow aside so much as one Load of Corn from any <hi>Parso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
barn</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> For though this <hi>History</hi> gave some
Countrey Gentlemen occasion and matter of discourse
against paying Tithes, yet it gave none of them the
audaciousness to deny the payment; So safe and speedy
a course was took to prevent the mischief: which since
our Author hath not told us (as had he plaid the part
of a good Historian he was bound to do) I will do it
for him.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>No sooner was the Churches Patrimony thus called
in question, but it pleased God to stir up some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious

that History, which at the first made so much noise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the people. Dr. <hi>Tillesly</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>

the Controversie, which our Author cals a <hi>Christian,</hi>
and an <hi>English-man,</hi> relating to old <hi>Chartularies</hi> and
<hi>Infeodations.</hi> The three first Chapters which Dr. <hi>Tillesly</hi>

the <hi>Historian</hi> was so gall'd by <hi>Tillesly,</hi> so gagg'd by

off in any of his undertakings with such losse of credit.

But now he found by these encounters, that some of
the <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>lazie</hi> Clergy were of as retired studies
as himself, and could not only match, but overmatch
him too in his own Philo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fol. 72. James <hi>Montague Bishop of</hi> Winchester <hi>a

the 39. Articles, the Book of the Ordination of
Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, and many Doctrinal

Ecclesiae Anglicanae</hi> he had caused to be Printed and
bound up together. A Book which might have been of
great honour to the Church of <hi>England</hi> amongst forain
Nations, and of no lesse use and esteem at home, had
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61619:111"/>
there not been somewhat else in it which deserved the
fire then this imaginary Quarrel. For by the Act of
Parliament 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. 10. the precedency of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
is thus Marshalled; that is to say, the Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> the Bishop of
<hi>London,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi>
the rest according to the order of their Consecrations;
yet so, that if any of them were Secretary to the King,
he should take place of all those other Bishops to
whom otherwise by the Order of his Consecration he
had been to give it. If the Doctor did mistake himself
in this particular (as indeed he did) the fault might
easily have been mended, as not deserving to be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
by so sharp a punishment. The following reason
touching his derogating from the Kings power in
Ecclesiastical matters, and adding it to the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
whose servant and Chaplain he was, hath more
reason in it (if it had but as much truth as reason) and
so hath that touching the Propositions by him gathered
out of the Homilies, which were rather framed according
to his own judgement, then squared by the Rules of the
Church. But that which I conceive to have been the
true cause why the Book was burned, was, that in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
the twentieth Article concerning the Authority
of the Church he totally left out the first clause of it,
<hi>viz. Habet Ecclesia Ritus sive Ceremonias statuendi jus
&amp; in Controversus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>vowed, and consequently a wide gap
opened to dispute her power, in all her Canons and
Determinations of what sort soever. And possible enough
it is, that some just offence might be taken at him, for
making the Fasting dayes appointed in the Liturgy of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be commanded and observed
<hi>ob Politi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> is solum rationes,</hi> for Politick Considerations
only, as insinuated <hi>pag.</hi> 308. whereas those Fasting-dayes
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61619:111"/>
were appointed in the first Liturgy of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the sixth <hi>Anno</hi> 1549. (with reference only to the
primitive Institution of those several Fasts) when no
such <hi>Politick considerations</hi> were so much as thought of.
But whatsoever was the true cause, or whether there were
more then one, as perhaps there was, certain I am it
could not be for derogating any thing from the Kings
Power, and enlarging that of the Archbishop <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
the election of Bishops,</hi> as our Author tels us. For
though the Doctor doth affirm of the Metropolitans of
the Church of <hi>England, pag. 308. Vt Electiones Episcopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
suae Provinciae confirment,</hi> that it belongs to them to
confirm the Electio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s of the Bishops of their several
Provinces, and for that purpose cites the Canon of the
Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> which our Author speaks of; yet
afterwards he declares expresly, that no such confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is or can be made by the Metropolitans, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kings <hi>assent</hi> preceding, <hi>Cujus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

from being <hi>a better Chaplain then he was a Subject,</hi> as
our Author makes him.</p>

points, &amp;c</hi>] Not at this time, <hi>viz.</hi> 1618. which our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="211"/>
Author speaks of, but some years before. They were
now come unto their height, and had divided the whole
body of the united <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces into two great
Factions: that of the Remonstrants (whom in reproach
they call their <hi>Minions)</hi> being headed by <hi>Iohn Olden Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevelt,</hi>
a principal Counseller of State and of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in his Countrey: the other of the Calvinists or

of <hi>Orange,</hi> the chief Commander of the Forces of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61619:112"/>
States united both by Sea and Land. But the troubles
and divisions were now come to their full growth, they
<hi>began</hi> many years before; occasioned by a Remonstrance
exhibited to the States of <hi>Holland</hi> by the followers of
Dr. <hi>Iames Harmin,</hi> who liked better the <hi>Melanchthoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

Hence grew the names of Remonstrants, and Contra-Remonstrants,
occurring frequently in the Writings on
both sides, till the Remonstrants were condemned in
the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> and either forced to yield the Cause,
or quit their Countrey. Each party in the mean time
had the opportunity to disperse their Doctrines, in
which the Remonstrants gained exceedingly upon their
Adversaries, especially after they had been admitted to

Westminstet, <hi>and soon after Bishop of</hi> Lincoln.] In this
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61619:113"/>
and the rest which followes touching the advancement of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="214"/> Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> to the place and dignity of <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi>
there are three things to be observed. And first it is to
be observed, that though he was <hi>then</hi> Dean of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
when the custody of the Great Seal was committed
to him; yet was he not <hi>then and still</hi> Dean of that
Church, that is to say, not Dean thereof at such time
as our Author writ this part of the History. For <hi>fol.</hi>
80. speaking of Dr. <hi>Hals return</hi> from the <hi>Synod</hi> of
<hi>Dort, Anno</hi> 1618. he addes that <hi>he continued in health till
this day thirty three years after,</hi> which fals into the year
1651. And certainly at that time Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> (then
Archbishop of <hi>York)</hi> was not Dean of <hi>Westminster,</hi> that
place having been bestowed by his Majesty upon <hi>Dr.
Steward</hi> Clerk of the Closet, <hi>An.</hi> 1645. being full six years
before the time which our Author speaks of. Secondly,
whereas our Author tells us, that the place was proper <hi>not
for the plain but guarded Gown;</hi> I would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ain know how it
should be more proper <hi>for the guarded Gown</hi> then it was
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="215"/> for the plain. There was a time when the Chancellors (as
our Author telleth us elsewhere) were always Bishops;
and from that time till the fall of Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> that
Office continued for the most part in the hands of the
Prelates; at what time that great Office was discharged
with such a general contentment, that people found
more expedition in their Suits, and more ease to their
Purses then of later times. By which it seems, that men
who are <hi>never bred to know the true grounds and reasons of the
Common Law,</hi> might and could mitigate the Rigour of it
in such difficult cases as were brought before them; the
Chancery not having in those days such a mixture of Law
as now it hath, not being so tyed up to such intricate Rules
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="216"/> as now it is. But thirdly, whereas our Author in advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

blows to them by his Pen, then by the defection of his
Person; his learned Books entituled <hi>De Republica Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticâ,</hi>
being still unanswered. In which respect, those
of that Church bestird themselves to disgrace his person,
devising many other causes by which he might be mov'd
or forc'd to forsake those parts, in which he durst no
longer tarry. But finding little credit given to their
libellous Pamphlets, they began to work upon him by
more secret practises: insinuating, that he had neither
that respect, nor those advancements which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
him to stay; that the new Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
was his special friend; that he might chuse his
own preferments, and make his own conditions, if he
would return. And on the other side, they cunningly
wrought him out of credit with <hi>King Iames</hi> by the
arts of <hi>Gondomar;</hi> and lessened his esteem amongst the
Clergy by some other Artifices: so that the poor man,
being in a manner lost on both sides, was forc'd to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of swallowing that accursed bait by which he
was hook'd over to his own destruction. For which and

proceed, the cause being brought unto a censure,</p>
                  <p>Fol. 157. <hi>Secretary</hi> Windebank <hi>motioned to degrade
him; which</hi> (saith he) <hi>was lustily pronounced by a Knight
and a Lay-man, having no precedent for the same in former
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="256"/> ages.</hi>] But first it is not very certain that any such thing
was moved by Sir <hi>Francis Windebank.</hi> A manuscript of
that dayes proceedings I have often seen, containing the
Decree and Sentence, with the substance of every Speech
then made, and amongst others, that of Sir <hi>Francis Winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank,</hi>
in which I finde no motion tending to a Degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor any other punishment inflicted on him then
Fine, Suspension, and Inprisonment, in which the residue
of the Lords concurred, as we finde in our Author.
Secondly, it had been more strange if the Knight had not
been a Lay-man, the Church of <hi>England</hi> not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
any Order of Spiritual Knighthood. Knights
in Divinity, are greater strangers in this Land, then Lay-Divines;
these last being multiplied of late, even <hi>ad
infinitum,</hi> the first never heard of. And thirdly, had it
been so mov'd, and so <hi>lustily</hi> mov'd, as our Author makes
it, the <hi>Knight</hi> and Lay-man might have found a precedent
for it in the former ages.</p>
                  <p>

the former times many precedents of like nature might be

Reformation, it is not so infallibly true, but that one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
of it at the least may be found amongst us. <hi>Marma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
Middleton</hi> advanced to the Bishoprick of St. <hi>Davids
Anno</hi> 1567. after he had sat in that See three and twenty
years, was finally condemned (for many notable misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors)
not only to be deprived of his Bishoprick, but
degraded from all holy Orders. Which sentence was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
executed by and before the High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
at <hi>Lambeth house,</hi> not only by reading it <hi>in Scriptis,</hi>
but by a formal devesting of him
of his Episcopal Robes and Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vestments<note n="*" place="margin">Whether Ceremonies used at his bringing in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the Court, and his thrusting out of it.</note>, as I have heard
from a person of good credit who
was present at it. And somewhat
there is further in the story of this <hi>Marmaduke Middleton</hi>
which concerns the <hi>Bishop</hi> now before us. Of whom our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="258"/>
Author telleth us further, that being prest by two Bishops
and three Doctors to answer upon Oath to certain Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which were tendred to him in the Tower; <hi>he utterly
refused to do it, claiming the priviledge of a Peer,</hi> fol. 159.
Which Plea was also made by the said Bishop of St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi>
offering to give in his Answer to such Articles as
were fram'd against him, <hi>on his Honour</hi> only, but refusing to
do it on his <hi>Oath.</hi> Which case being brought before the
Lords then sitting in Parliament, was ruled against him;
it being ordered that he should answer upon Oath, as in
fine he did. To this Bishop let us joyne his Chaplain
Mr. <hi>Osbolstone,</hi> who being engag'd in the same Bark with
his Patron suffered shiprack also, though not at the same
time, nor on the same occasion. Censured in <hi>Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>

he had scapt the last penalty, had he staid at home. For
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="259"/> though Mr. <hi>Osbolston</hi> at that time conceived the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
to be his greatest enemy, yet the Archbishop was
resolved to shew himself his greatest friend, assuring the
Author of these Papers (before any thing was known of
Mr. <hi>Osbolstons</hi> supposed flight) that he would cast himself
at the Kings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eet for obtaining a discharge of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
punishment unto which he was sentenced. Which
may obtain the greater credit; First, in regard that no
course was taken to stop his flight, no search made after
him, nor any thing done in Order to his apprehension.
And secondly, by Mr. <hi>Osbolstons</hi> readiness to do the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
all good Offices in the time of his troubles,
upon the knowledge which was given him (at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

this in relation to the <hi>Scottish</hi> tumults, <hi>Anno</hi> 1637. In

the Plot had been laid long before upon other grounds,

in the hands of some great Persons, of which they feared

for raising of a tumult first, a Rebellion afterwards; and
this occasion they conceiv'd they had happily gain'd by
sending the <hi>new Liturgy thither,</hi> though ordered by their
own Clergy first, as our Author tells us, at the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of <hi>Aberdeen, Anno</hi> 1616. and after at <hi>Perth, Anno</hi>

no such matter as the <hi>passing of an Act of Revocation for the

to ensue upon it, he followed the safer counsel of <hi>Sir
Archibald Acheson,</hi> by whom he was advis'd to sue them
in his Courts of Justice. Which course succeeding to his
wish so ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

little else but such Lands to maintain their Dignities;
that they never thought themselves secure, as long as the
King was in a condition to demand his own. Thirdly,
though it be true enough, that <hi>some Persons of Honour had
been denied such higher Titles as they had desired,</hi> fol. 163.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="262"/> Yet was it not the denying of such Titles unto <hi>Men of

they had no head. But the King not willing to dishonor
so high a Title by conferring it on so low a person, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
the favour: which put the man into such a heat,

which it was declared, that the <hi>Scots</hi> entred <hi>England</hi>
with a purpose to remove the Archbishop from the King,
and execute their vengeance on him. What hand
Dr. <hi>Cousins</hi> had in assisting of the work, I am not able
to say. But sure I am, that there was nothing done in
it by the Bishops of <hi>England,</hi> but with the counsel and
co-operation of their Brethren in the Church of <hi>Scotland,
viz.</hi> the Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Archbishop of
<hi>Glasco,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Murray, Ross, Brechin,</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blane,</hi>

must needs know (but that he hath a minde to
quarrel the Archbishop upon every turn) as appears
plainly, 1. By his Narrative of the Design in King <hi>Iames</hi>
his time, from the first undertaking of it by the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whose Book corrected by that King with some
<hi>additions, expunctions,</hi> and <hi>accommodations,</hi> was sent back
to <hi>Scotland.</hi> 2. By that unsatisfiedness which he seems
to have when the project was resum'd by King <hi>Charles,</hi>
whether the Book by him sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> were the
same which had passed the hands of King <hi>Iames,</hi> or not:
which he expresseth in these words, <hi>viz. In the Reign of
King</hi> Charles, <hi>the project was resumed, but whether the
same Book or no, God knoweth,</hi> fol. 160. If so, if <hi>God only
knoweth whether it were the same or no,</hi> how dares he tell
us that it was not? and if it was <hi>the same</hi> (as it may be
for ought he knoweth) with what conscience can he
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61619:131"/>
charge the making of it upon Bishop <hi>Laud.</hi> Besides (as
afterwards he telleth us <hi>fol. 163.) the Church of</hi> Scotland
<hi>claimed not only to be</hi> Independent, <hi>and free as any Church
in Christendom, a Sister, not a Daughter of</hi> England. And
consequently the Prelates of that Church had more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to decline the receiving of a Liturgy impos'd on them
or commended to them by the Primate of <hi>England,</hi> for
fear of acknowledging any subordination to him; then
to receive the same Liturgy here by Law establisht, which
they might very safely borrow from their Sister Church
without any such danger. But howsoever it was, the blame
must fall on him who did least deserve it.</p>
                     <p>Fol. 167. <hi>Thus none, seeing now foul weather in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>could expect it fair Sun-shine in</hi> England.] In this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="267"/>

that small body, or excluding any man from being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

so let it goe. But I needed not to have signified that
our Author was one of this Committee, he will tell it
himself. And he will tell us more then that, publishing
himself for one of the thirty six <hi>Dissenters,</hi> the better
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="277"/> to ingratiate himself with the rising side. <hi>The next day</hi>

to be all concluded by the majority of votes, though</hi> some
of US <hi>in the Committee</hi> privately dissented <hi>in the passing

to play the good fellow at the last, and go along hand
in hand with the rest of his company; <hi>dissenting pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,</hi>
but consenting publickly, which is as much as
can be looked for.</p>
                     <p>Ibid. <hi>No sooner came these Canons abroad into a publick

possible that in such a confusion both of Affections and

there are <hi>many men</hi> to have <hi>many mindes.</hi> And yet if

great approbation from the mouths of some, from whom
it had been least expected; particularly from Justice

Of whom I have been told by a person of great
worth and credit, that having read over the Book of
Canons, when it first came out, he lifted up his
hands, and gave hearty thanks to Almighty God,
that he had liv'd to see such good effects of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

It was very well, that they pleased him;

hoped for.</p>
                     <p>Fol. 171. <hi>Many took exception at the hollowness of
the Oath in the middle thereof, having its Bowels puffed up
with a windy &amp;c. a</hi> cheveral <hi>word, which might be stretched
as men would measure it.</hi>] Of this <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which has made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="279"/>
so much noise in the world I shall now say nothing.
Somewhat is here subjoyn'd by our Author in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

thereof, the rest made up by the <hi>Observator.</hi> Only I
shall make bold to ask him, why he observ'd not this
&amp;c. when the Oath was first under consideration; or
why he signified not his <hi>dissent</hi> when it came to the vote,
and shewed some reasons which might move him to
object against it. It had been fitter for a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
man to signifie his dislike of any thing when it
might be mended, then to joyn with others in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning

malus animus,</hi> as the saying is. The Convocation had no
ill intent in it when they passed it so, though some few,
out of their perverseness and corrupt affections, were
willing to put their own sense on it, and spoil an
honest-meaning Text with a factious Gloss. But let
us follow our Author as he leads the way, and we shall
finde that</p>
                     <p>Ibid. <hi>Some Bishops were very forward in pressing this
Oath even before the time thereof. For whereas a liberty
was allowed to all, to deliberate thereon, until the Feast
of</hi> Michael <hi>the Arch-angel, some presently pressed the
Ministers of their Diocesses for the taking thereof.</hi>] It <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="280"/>
seems by this that our Author was so far from taking
notice of any thing done in the Convocation, when
the Canon for the Oath was framed, that he never
so much as looked into the Canon it self, since the
Book came out. He had not else d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eamt of a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Deliberation, till the Feast of St. <hi>Michael the
Arch-angel,</hi> which I am sure the Canon gives not.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61619:136"/>
The <hi>Synod did indeed decree, that all Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Canon. 7. 1640.</note>
                        <hi>and Bishops, and all other Priests
and Deacons, in places exempt or not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt,
should before the second day of</hi> November <hi>next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing,
take the following Oath against all innovation of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or Discipline.</hi> By which we see, that the Oath
was to be given and taken before the second of <hi>November,</hi>
but no such thing as <hi>Liberty of Deliberation till the Feast
of St.</hi> Michael. And therefore if some Bishops did press
the Clergy of their several and respective Diocesses, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon
as they returned home from the Convocation;
they might well doe it by the Canon, without making
any such <hi>Essay of their Activity, if providence</hi> (as our
Author most <hi>wisely</hi> words it) had not prevented them.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>If any of the Bishops did require their Clergy to take
the Oath upon their knees (as he says they did) though
it be more then was directed by the Canon, yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that no wise man would scruple at it, considering
the gravity and greatness of the business which he was
about. But then</p>
                     <p>Ibid. <hi>The Exception of Exceptions was, because they were
generally condemned as illegally passed to the prejudice of the
fundamental Liberty of the Subject, whereof we shall hear
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="282"/> enough in the next Parliament.]</hi> Not <hi>generally condemned,</hi>
either as <hi>illegally passed,</hi> or as tending to <hi>prejudice</hi> of the
Subjects Rights, I am sure of that. Scarse so much as
condemned by any for those respects, but by such whom
it concern'd (for carrying on of their Designs) to weaken
the Authority of the Church, and advance their own.
But because our Author tells us, that we shall finde enough
of this in the following Parliament, we are to follow
him to that Parliament for our satisfaction.
And there we finde that Mr. <hi>Maynard</hi> made
a Speech in the Committee of Lords against
the Canons,<note place="margin">Church Hist. fol 180.</note> made by the Bishops in the
last Convocation, in which he endeavoured to prove,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61619:136"/>
that the Clergy had no power to make Canons, without
common consent in Parliament, because <hi>in the</hi> Saxon
<hi>times Laws and Constitutions Ecclesiastical had the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Peers, and sometimes of the People, to which great
Councels our Parliaments do succeed.</hi> Which Argument <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="283"/>
if it be of force to prove, That the Clergy can make no
<hi>Canons</hi> without consent of the Peers and people in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
it must prove also that the Peers and People
can make no <hi>Statutes</hi> without consent of the Clergy in
their Convocation. My reason is, because such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
in the times of the <hi>Saxons</hi> were mixt Assemblies,
consisting as well of Laicks, as of Eccles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>asticks, and the
matters there concluded on of a mixt nature also; Laws
being passed as commonly in them in order to the
good governance of the Common-wealth, as Canons for
the Regulating such things as concern'd Religion. But
these great Councels of the <hi>Saxons</hi> being divided into
two parts in the times ensuing, the Clergy did their
work by themselves without any confirmation from the
King or Parliament, till the submission of the Clergy
to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth. And if the Parliaments did
succeed in the place of those great Councels (as he
sayes they did) it was because that antiently the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curators
of the Clergy, not the Bishops only, had their
place in Parliament, though neither <hi>Peers</hi> nor <hi>People</hi> vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Convocations. Which being so, it is not
much to be admired <hi>that there was some checking</hi> (as is
said in the second Argument) <hi>about the disuse of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="284"/>
making of such Church Laws.</hi> But <hi>checking</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
at the proceeding of any superior Court makes
not the Acts thereof illegal. For if it did, the Acts of
Parliaments themselves would be reputed of no force,
or illegally made, because the Clergy for a long time
have <hi>checkt</hi> (and think they have good cause to check)
for thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which in brief was this: The Commons f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nding
themselves aggrieved, as well with certain Constitutions
made by the Clergy in their Synods, as with some Laws
or Ordinances which were lately passed, more to the
advantage of the Clergy then the common people, put
in a Bill to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>That no Act nor Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nce
should from thenceforth be made or granted on
the Petition of the said Clergy, without the consent of
the Commons; and that the said Commons should not
be bound in times to come by any Constitutions made
by the Clergy of this Realm for their own advantage,
to which the Commons of this Realm had not given
consent.</q> The reason of which is this (and 'tis worth
the marking;) <q>
                           <hi>Car eux ne veulent estre obligez a nul
de vos Estatuz ne Ordinances faitz sanz leur Assent,</hi>
because the said Clergy did not think themselves bound
(as indeed they were not in those times) by any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
Act, or Ordinance, made without their Assent in
the Court of Parliament.</q> But that which could not
be obtain'd by this <hi>checking</hi> of the Commons in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
and last times of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. was in some part
effected by the more vigorous prosecution of King
<hi>Hen.</hi> 8. who to satisfie the desires of the Commons in
this particular, and repress their checkings, obtained
from the Clergy, that they should neither make nor exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
any Canons without his consent, as before is said;
so that the Kings power of confirming Canons was
grounded on the free and voluntary submission of the
Clergy, and was not built, as the third Argument ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ecteth,
on to weak a foundation as <hi>the Popes making
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61619:137"/>
Canons by his sole power:</hi> the Pope not making Canons
here, nor putting his Rescripts and Letters decretory in
the place of Canons, but only as a remedy for some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
exigency. So that the Kings power in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
not being built upon the Popes, as he said it was,
it may well stand, <hi>That Kings may make Canons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
consent of Parliament,</hi> though he saith they cannot.
But whereas it is argued in the fourth place, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="286"/>
clause in the Statute of Submission, in which it is said,
that <hi>the Clergy shall not make Canons without the Kings
leave,</hi> doth not imply that by his leave alone they may
make them; I cannot think that he delivered this for
Law, and much less for Logick. For had this been
looked on formerly as a piece of Law, the Parliaments
would have <hi>check'd</hi> at it at some time or other, and been
as sensible of the Kings encroachments in executing
this power without them, as antiently some of them
had been about the <hi>disuse</hi> of the like general consent in
the making of them.</p>
                     <p>Fol. 180. In the next place our Author tells us that
Mr. <hi>Maynard endevoured also to prove, that these Canons
were against the Kings</hi> Prerogative, <hi>the Rights, Liberties,
and Properties of the Subject.</hi>] And he saith well, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="287"/>
it was endevoured to be proved, and endeavoured only,
nothing amounting to a proof being to be found in that
which follows. It had before been voted by the House
of Commons, that the <hi>Commons are against
fundamental Laws of this Realm,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hist K Charls. fol. 208.</note> 
                        <hi>against the
Kings Prerogative, prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap> of the Subject,
the Right of Parliament, and do tend to faction
and sedition;</hi> and it was fit that some <hi>endeavours</hi> should
be used to make good the <hi>Vote.</hi> But this being but a
general charge, requires a general answer only, and it
shall be this. Before the Canons we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e subscribed, they
were imparted to the King by the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and by the King communicated to the Lords of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61619:138"/>
the Councel; who calling to them the assistance of the
Judges, and some of the Kings Councel learned in the
Laws of this Realm, caus'd the said Canons to be read
and considered of, the King being then present. By all
which upon due and mature deliberation the Canons
were approv'd, and being so approv'd, were sent back to
the Clergy in the Convocation, and by them subscribed.
And certainly it had been strange that they should pass
the approbation of the Judges and learned <hi>Lawyers,</hi> had
they contained any thing <hi>against the fundamental Laws
of the Land, the property of the Subject, and the Rights of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi>
or been approv'd of by the Lords of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Conncel, had any thing been contained in them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to the Kings <hi>Prerogative,</hi> or <hi>tending to Faction
and Sedition.</hi> So that the foundation being ill laid, the
superstructures and objections which are built upon it, may
be easily shaken and thrown down. To the first therefore
it is answered, that nothing hath been more ordinary in all
former times, then for the Canons of the Church to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
<hi>penalties</hi> on such as shall <hi>disobey them;</hi> exemplified in
the late Canons of 603. many of which extend not only
unto Excommunication, but even to <hi>Degradation</hi> and <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity,</hi>
for which see <hi>Can. 38. 113. &amp;c.</hi> To the second,
That there is nothing in those Canons which <hi>determineth</hi>
or limiteth the Kings Authority, but much that makes
for and defendeth the Right of the Subject, for which
the Convocation might rather have expected thanks then
censure from ensuing Parliaments. To the third, That
when the Canon did declare the Government of Kings to
be founded on the Law of Nature, it was not to condemn
all other Governments as being unlawful, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
that of Kings as being the best. Nor can it Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
be infer'd, that because the Kingly Government is
not received in all places, that therefore it ought not so
to be: or that the Gove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be the same in all <hi>places,</hi> and in all <hi>alike;</hi> because some

I cannot chuse but say, that the Number of Six hundred

The Papists on the other side finde it in the name

which made this Observation upon the Covenant, he
deserves more to be commended for his wit, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

thousands of true <hi>English</hi> Protestants having lost their

were seis'd on by Mr. <hi>Prin)</hi> which he had not book'd
in a Memorial by the way of a Diary or Journal. Out

of his faults,</hi> (as our Author words it) that it shew'd
him to be a Man of Exemplary Piety in himself, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
fidelity to his friend, of most perfect loyalty to
his Master, and honest affections to the Publick. He
that shall look upon the list of the things projected to
be done, and in part done, by him, <hi>fol. 28,</hi> 29. will
finde, that both his heart was set on, and his hand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in many excellent pieces of work, tending to the
great honour and benefit both of Church and State;
not incident to a man of such <hi>narrow comprehensions,</hi>
as some of his profest Enemies were pleas'd to make
him. Certain I am, that as Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> lost his end, so he
could not get much thanks for that piece of service.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="315"/> satisfaction of our Author, and the Reader both. It was
in <hi>Nobember, Anno</hi> 1639. that I receiv'd a message
from the Lord <hi>Archbishop,</hi> to attend him the next day
at two of the clock in the afternoon. The Key being

him sitting in a chair, holding a paper in both hands,
and his eyes so fixt upon that paper, that he observ'd
me not at my coming in. Finding him in that posture,
I thought it fit and manners to retire again. But the
noise I made by my retreat, bringing him back unto
himself, he recall'd me again, and told me after some
short pawse, that he well remembred that he had sent
for me, but could not tell for his life what it was about.
After which he was pleas'd to say (no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he took God to witness; conjuring me (as I would
answer it to God at the day of Judgement) that if ever I
came to any of those places, which he, and his Brethren
by reason of their great age were not like to hold long,
I would imploy all such abilities as God had given me
in suppressing that party, who by their open unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this flourishing Church. After some words of mine
upon that occasion, I found some argument to divert
him from those sad remembrances, and having brought
him to some reasonable composedness, I took leave for
the present; and some two or three dayes after wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on him again, he then told me the reason of his
sending for me the time before. And this I deliver for
a truth on the faith of a Christian; which I hope will
over-ballance any Evidence which hath been brought to

not only <hi>salva charitare,</hi> without breach of charity,

But hereof our Author seems to doubt, first whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="262" facs="tcp:61619:149"/>
endeavours to agree and compose the differences be <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="317"/> or not; and secondly, whether they be <hi>possible.</hi> As
for the lawfulness thereof, I could never see any reason
produc'd against it, nor so much as any question made of
it till I found it here: against the possibility thereof, it
hath been objected, that such, and so great is the pride
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they will condescend to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And therefore if any such composition or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be made, it must not be by their meeting us, but
our going to them. But as our Author sayes, that many
of the Archbishops <hi>equals adjudg'd</hi> that <hi>design</hi> of his to
be <hi>impossible;</hi> so I may say (without making any such
odious Comparisons) that many of our Authors <hi>betters</hi>
have thought otherwise of it. It was the petulancy of
the Puritans on the one side, and the pragmaticalness
of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> on the other side, which made the breach
wider then it was at the first; and had those hot spirits
on both sides been charm'd a while, moderate men might
possibly have agreed on such equal terms, as would
have said a sure Foundation for the Peace of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Now that all those in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are
not so stiffly wedded to their own opinions as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
makes them, appears, first by the testimony of the
Archbishop of <hi>Spalato</hi> declaring in the <hi>High Commission</hi>
a little before his going hence, that he <hi>acknowledged
the Articles of this Church to be true, or profitable at the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="318"/> least, and none of them Heretical.</hi> It appears secondly, by
a Tractate of <hi>Franciscus de Sancta Clara</hi> (as he calls
himself) in which he putteth such a gloss upon the
nine and thirty Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as
rendreth them not inconsistent with the Doctrines of
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And if <hi>without prejudice to the
truth,</hi> the Controversies might have been compos'd,
it is most probable, that other Protestant Churches
would have sued by their Agents to be included in the
Peace: if not, the Church of <hi>England</hi> had lost nothing
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61619:149"/>
by it, as being hated by the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and not lov'd by
the <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But our Author will not here desist (so soon hath he
forgotten his own rule made in the case of Mr. <hi>Love)</hi>
and therefore mustereth up his faults, <hi>viz. 1. Passion,</hi>

thing contained in it. Nor indeed could it stand with
reason, that they should wave the patronage of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Soveraign, who had been a <hi>Nursing Father</hi> to them,
and put themselves under the arbitrary power of those
who they knew minded nothing but destruction toward
them. And that the University did not think it self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
by any thing contained in that Article, appears
even by our Author himself, who tells us in this very pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
that <hi>the Delegates from the Vniversity pleaded their
priviledges before the Committee of Parliament, that they
were only visitable by the King, and such as should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by him;</hi> which certainly they had never done (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
our Author will conclude them to be fools or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
had they before submitted to that <hi>Paramount pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
which he adscribes unto the <hi>Houses.</hi> Nor did the
Houses of Parliament finde themselves impowered by
this clause of the Article, to obtrude any such <hi>Visitation</hi>
on them. And therefore when the Delegates had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and prov'd their priviledges, a Commission for a
Visitation was issued by the two Houses of Parliament
in the name of the King, but under the new broad Seal
which themselves had made; which notwithstanding,
the University stood still on their own defence, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that though the Kings name was us'd in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
yet they knew well, that he had never given his
consent unto it. Whereupon followed that great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

which our Author speaks of.</p>
                     <p>Nor deals he much more candidly in relating the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="323"/> proceedings of the <hi>Visitation,</hi> which was made in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;</hi>
the <hi>Visitors</hi> whereof (as acting by the <hi>Paramount
power of Parliament)</hi> he more sensibly favoureth, then
the poor sufferers, or <hi>malignant members,</hi> as he calls them,
of that <hi>Vniversity.</hi> For whereas the Author of the
Book called <hi>Querela Cantabrigionsis,</hi> hath told us of an
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61619:151"/>
                        <hi>Oath of Discovery,</hi> obtruded by the <hi>Visitors</hi> upon several
persons, whereby they were sworn to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
one another,<note place="margin">Hist. of Cam, fol. 168.</note> even their dearest friends;
Our Author who was out of the storm, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not <hi>satisfied</hi> in the <hi>truth</hi> of this relation,
must write to Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> who was one of those <hi>Visitors,</hi>
to be inform'd in that which he knew before; and on
the reading of Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> his Answer, declares expresly,
that <hi>no such Oath was tendred by him to that Vniversity.</hi>
But first, Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> doth not absolutely deny, that there
was any such Oath, but that he <hi>was a stranger to it,</hi> and
possibly he might be so far a <hi>stranger</hi> to it, as not to be
an Actor in that part of the Tragedy. Secondly, Mr. <hi>Ash</hi>
only saith, that he <hi>cannot call to minde, that any such
thing was mov'd by the Earl of</hi> Manchester; and yet I
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>row, such a thing might be mov'd by the Earl of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
though Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> after so many years was willing
not <hi>to call it to minde,</hi> or else if no such Oath was <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by him,</hi> as our Author is assur'd there was not, that
part of the Tragedy might be acted by Mr. <hi>Good</hi> the
other Chaplain, without communicating his Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to his fellow <hi>Visitor.</hi> And therefore thirdly, I
would know why Mr. <hi>Good</hi> was not writ to also, that
having from him the like Certificate, our Author might
have had the better grounds for his <hi>unbelief,</hi> before he
had pronounc'd so positively against the Author of that
<hi>Querela.</hi> Fourthly, and finally, it is not easie to be
thought, that the Author of that Book should have
vented s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ch a manifest falshood, especially in a matter so
derogatory to all Christian charity, and that neither the
<hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Manchester,</hi> nor either of his two <hi>Chaplains,</hi> or
any friend of theirs, should in the space of ten years and
more, endeavour to wipe off such an odious imputation,
till our Author out of pure zeal to the <hi>Paramount power,</hi>
played the Advocate in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:61619:152"/>
But to return again to <hi>Oxford,</hi> one of the first effects
which followed on the alteration before remembred
(though mentioned by our Author in another place)
was the risling of the Treasury in <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge,
of which he tells us, <hi>lib. 9. fol.</hi> 234. That a <hi>considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sum of gold,</hi> being by Dr. <hi>Humphry</hi> (who had been
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="324"/> Master of that Colledge) <hi>left in a Chest, not to be opened,
except some great necessity urged thereunto, was lately
shar'd between Dr.</hi> Wilkinson (who then held the place
of President by the power of the Visitors) <hi>and the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi>
there. But first our Author is mistaken in Dr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry,</hi>
though he be willing to entitle him (whom he calls
a <hi>moderate Non-conformist)</hi> to some benefaction. The
sum there found amounted to above twelve hundred
double Pistolets, the old Doctor having no fewer then
one hundred for his part of the spoil, and every Fellow
thirty a piece for theirs; each Pistolet exchang'd at six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
shillings six pence, and yet the Exchanger got well
by the bargain too. Too great a sum for Dr. <hi>Humphry,</hi>
who had many children, and no provident woman to
his wife, to leave behinde him to the Colledge, had
he been so minded. The money (as the Tradition went
in that Colledge) was left there by the Founder, to
remedy and repair such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uines as either the casualty of fire,
or the ravages of a Civil war might bring upon it; to
which the nature of the Coin being all <hi>French</hi> pieces
(remember that the <hi>English</hi> at that time were Masters
of a great part of <hi>France)</hi> gives a further testimony.
Secondly, I would have our Author observe, that those
whom he accuseth of this act of Rapine, were neither
<hi>high Royalists,</hi> nor <hi>Covetous Conformists,</hi> as we know
who words it, but men agreeable to the times, and of
the same temper and affections which himself is of, the
<hi>Conformists</hi> never being so <hi>covetous</hi> as to cast an eye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it, nor the <hi>high Royalists</hi> so ignoble in their greatest
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61619:152"/>
extremities, as to lay hands on it. And thirdly, I
must needs charge our Author with some partiality in
aggravating this fact (which indeed cannot be excused)
with so many circumstances, and passing over the like
at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as a thing incredible; <hi>I cannot believe,</hi>
saith he, Hist. Camb. fol. 38. <hi>what</hi> I have <hi>read</hi> in the
<hi>Querela Cantabrigiensis, That three or four hundred pounds
worth of Timber brought to</hi> Clare-hall <hi>for the repair of
that House, was lately taken away;</hi> that is to say, inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

favourable he is to his friends in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as
to pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and most invincible unbelief that I ever met with.
There remains nothing now to conclude these Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,
but some passages relating to Archbishop
<hi>Williams:</hi> in which I must confess my self not willing
to meedle, but that I think it is as much against the
Rule of distributive Justice to give one man to much, as
to give another man too little. Let us see therefore
what he saith of this Prelate, and how far he saith
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. And
first saith he,</p>
                     <p>Fol. 227. <hi>He sueth to the Parliament for favour, and
obtained it, whose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ore it is not to
be thought, but that he had done some special service
to the Parliament to prepare the way for such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
Before his commitment to the Tower about the
Bishops Protestation, he was grown as odious to the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61619:153"/>
Commons, as before he had been honoured by them.
He had liv'd some time with the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and
is said to have done him good services in <hi>Wales;</hi> and
(which is most) he had a fair temporal Estate, able to
yeeld some thousands of pounds for Composition in
<hi>Goldsmiths-hall.</hi> So that there must be somewhat in it
more then ordinary, which occasioned that he neither
came under Fine nor Ransom, as the rest of the Kings
Party did. But what that was, whether he serv'd
them with intelligence when he was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> or by
inhibiting his Tenants and neighbours to pay their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
Taxes to the Kings Forces when he liv'd in
<hi>Wales,</hi> I determine not. Certain it is, that before
his redintegration with them, he had been in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
besieged in his House of <hi>Penrin</hi> by the Lord <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
for the prohibiting of sending in such provisions
as had been required; and that observing with what
carelesness the Kings Souldiers did attend that service,
he caus'd a sally to be made out of the House, and slew
many of them. Upon the merit of which service,
and the promise of greater, it is no wonder if such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and Sollicitors of his as were imploy'd in that
business, compounded for him without <hi>fine,</hi> though not
without money. That which our Author tells us of his
being their General, seems to have been fore-signified
some five or six years before the siege of <hi>Conway</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="326"/> For I remember that about such time as he
was Prisoner in the Tower with the rest of the Bishops,
his picture was sold commonly in black and white,
in his Episcopal Roabs, with a square Cap on his head,
a Rest in his hand, a Musket on his shoulder, and a
Bandeleir about his neck. For which fancy at that time
I could learn no reason, though he came up to it at the
last. But he goes on.</p>

be all which they have to say for the Bishops chastity,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="328"/> Amongst which <hi>benefactions</hi> it was none of the
least, that in both the Universities he had so many Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners;
more (as it was commonly given out) then all the
Noble-men and Bishops in the Land together: some of
which receiv'd twenty Nobles, some ten pounds, and
other twenty Marks <hi>per annum.</hi> And yet it may be
said without envy, that none of all these Pensions came
out of his own purse, but were laid as Rent-charges
upon such Benefices as were in his disposing, either
as Lord Keeper or Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and assign'd
over to such Scholars in each University as apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves to him. And because I would not
be thought to say this without Book, I have both seen
and had in my keeping, till of late, (if I have it not
still) an Acquittance made unto a Minister in discharge
of the payment of a Pension of twenty Nobles <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
to one who was then a Student in <hi>Christ-Church.</hi>
The names of the parties I forbear, he that receiv'd it,
and he for whom it was receiv'd, (and perhaps he that
paid it too) being still alive. And possible enough it
is, that this Pensioning of so many Scholars had not
been past over in silence by our Author, if he had not
known the whole truth as well as the truth.</p>

but the Churches rents: For at such time as he was made
Lord Keeper of the great Seal; he caused it to be signified
unto the Prebendaries of that Church, how inconvenient
it would be both to him and them to keep up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of the Colledge; and gaind so farre upon them
that they pass'd over to him all the rents of that Church,
upon condition that he should pay the annual pensions
of the Prebendaries, School-masters, Quire-men, and
inferiour Officers, and maintain the Commons of the
Scholars. The rest amounting to a great yearly value,
was left wholly to him upon his honourable word and
promise to expend the same for the good and honour of
that Church. The surplusage of which expenses receiv'd
by him for four years and upwards, amounted unto
more than had been laid out by him on the Church and
Library; as was offered to be proved before the Lords
Commissioners at the visitation <hi>Anno.</hi> 1635. And as for
the Library at <hi>St. Iohns,</hi> it might possibly cost him more
wit than money; many books being dayly sent in to
him (upon the intimation of his purpose of founding
the two Libraries) by such as had either suits in Court,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="330"/>

were these two especially: First, A Report that
the Task was undertaken by a <hi>Cambridge</hi> man, who had
more knowledge of the Author whom I had to deale
with then I can pretend to; and I desired rather that
the burthen of it the publick, satisfaction to all parties
intrusted, should be born by any then my self. Secondly,
There was a generall opinion spred abroad in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(to what ends I know not, nor much care) that
the <hi>Church Historian</hi> was in hand with a <hi>Review</hi> of the
Work before us, in which he was resolved to make
some fair amends to Truth, to correct the errors of his
Pen, and to make reparation to the injured Clergy, and,
to say truth, there was none fitter then himself for that
undertaking, none fitter to give Plaisters for the broken

<hi>Paris,</hi> nor kept any Communion with the Papists
therein, but confined himself to the Church of <hi>English</hi>
Protestants therein, where, by his pious living, constant
praying and preaching, he reduced some Recusants to,
and confirmed more Doubters in, the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
Many were his Encounters with Jesuits and
Priests, defeating the suspicions of his Foes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
the expectacion of his Friends in the success of
such Disputes.</p>

and truth of this I am much unsatisfied, as never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

born but Earls, whereby they are put in an equal rank with
the eldest sons of Dukes in <hi>England,</hi> who commonly have
the Title of their Fathers Earldoms. since it is plain they are
born Princes, which is the highest civil Dignity next to that
of Kings: It was indeed usual with the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> to
bestow upon their yongest Sons some Earldom or other, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; after which time, they
were invested with the Title of Dukes, as appears evidently
to any who are studied in their Chronologies: But that they,
or any of them, were Earls by Birth, is a new piece of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

Histories, as to the Composing of Orations, or
any other Philosophical, Civil, or Divine discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
that is to say, clearnesse of Method, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity

in a wood, in which he can neither travel with
pleasure, nor stand still with profit. Or if the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

the vulgar Reader, either by new affected words,
not to be understood without the help of a <hi>Dictionary,</hi>
or by obscure expressions which require a <hi>Comment;</hi>
he stands deprived of that contentment which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

                     <p>Which said in reference to the Author and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
History, I must say somewhat of my self, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61619:190"/>
my ingaging in the survey and correction of it: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, the Reader may be pleased to know,
that about Midsummer last, Mr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> found me
out at my lodging in <hi>London,</hi> where after some ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Civilities passed between us, he told me that he
had undertaken the History of King <hi>Charls,</hi> and that
he was required by the Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to
do him some right in the business of the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
which he resolved so to do, and with such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto my person, that I should finde no just cause
to be offended at his writing: I answered, that I was
resolved to have nothing to do in the Quarrels of the
Observator, and therefore he might use his pleasure:
I had a purpose thereupon of perusing the History,
and taking notice of such Errors and Mistakes (if any
such were) as possibly I might chance to meet with,
and having so done, to send them to him, with my
Conceptions and Corrections in a private way, that
he might do himself the right of rectifying them in
a short Review, and joyning that Review to as many
of the Books as remained unsold: And this he might
have done with great advantage to the Reader, and
without disparagement to himself; two as great
Clerks as any of the age they lived in having done the
like, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his <hi>Retra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in his Book of <hi>Recognitions:</hi> But when I came to that
part of it, which concerned the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> and
the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> I saw my self so coursly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and so despightfully reproached, that I found
good cause to change my purpose, &amp; not to take such
care to save his credit, who had so little care of his
own, and less of mine: <hi>Seipsum deserentem omnia dese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi>

Court Holy-water in the end of his Preface; but
beat me with the spit, and <hi>basles</hi> me all over with

made me change my first purpose and intentions

                     <p>And yet I cannot chuse but say, I was never at a

was now in his power, returned this answer, that if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of that place did startle no other jealousies in the
minds of the Neighbouring Princes then it did in his, he
might go on with it when he pleased; which words being
taken by the Bishop for a permission and encouragement to
proceed in the work, it went on accordingly. But scarce

of peace, dispatcht their Agents to the Prince, desiring to
know the reason why he suffered the Bishop to entrench

And though he did perform this promise, yet the work went
forward, the Bishop having secretly obtained license from the
Emperor, (as the Lord Paramount of all) to proceed therein.

Electors, came before the Town, and sent a Trumpet to the
Bishop, requiring him to give present order for the dismant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the place, or to give them leave to do it for him:
The Bishop returns no other Answer, but that they should
go to such a post, where they should find a copy of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
Placard, in justification of his act touching those Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
But the Souldiers, taking notice of no other authority
then that which they received from their several Princes, made
themselves masters of the place (the Ports and Circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it being unfinisht) without any resistance; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made all level again, disbanded, and went home to their
several Countries: For this contempt of the Imperial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
the Prince Elector, who had the chief conduct of
this Action, was cited to the Chamber of <hi>Spires,</hi> where the
cause went on so fast against him, that he was at the point to
be <hi>Proscribed,</hi> when the unfortunate Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was
offered to him, of which more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But through that spot, the Spaniard had free Passage with
his Forces of</hi> Italy, <hi>and other parts, to pass into the Netherlands,
to reduce them to obedience.</hi>] No freer passage thorow that
Spot, (if so fair and large a Countrey may be called a Spot)
then he had before; the <hi>Spanish</hi> Armies finding an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll'd
March from the <hi>Alps</hi> to the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> without
touching on any part of the lower <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so it will be found by any who shall follow the tract of
the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> conducting an Army of old Souldiers, both
Horse and Foot, some <hi>Germ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

taken in by the way, from the Dukedom of <hi>Millain</hi> into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi>
So that if there had not been some other reason why
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> engaged themselves in the Conquest of this
Countrey, then the opening a free passage for their Armies,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61619:194"/>
to march out of <hi>Italy</hi> into the <hi>Netherl.</hi> it might have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unconquered by them to this very day: But the truth is,
that both the Emperor and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acted by the Counsels of the Jesuits, resolv'd upon some
compulsory courses, to bring all <hi>Germany</hi> under the obedience
of the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> and to that end, thought fit to begin
with the Prince Elector Palatine (as appears by several Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
exemplified in the Book, entituled, <hi>Cancellaria Bavarica,</hi>
as being the chief head of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> party in the Empire,
and having made himself doubly obnoxious to a present pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
which Proscription being issued out, the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it was committed to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who was
to have the upper Palatinate, together with the Electoral
Dignity, the better to enable him to carry on the Design<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as best able to go thorow with
it, who was to have the lower Palatinate wholly to himself,
that his Forces might be always in readiness to carry on the
War from one Prince to another, till the Emperor had made
himself the absolute Master of them all.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Germany</hi> we pass into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where we finde the

the English Discipline:</hi> So here, and hereupon the credit of
hear-say onely; but in another place, where he rather acts the
part of an Historian, then of one that is to speak in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
he relates it thus: <q>King <hi>Iames</hi> had a Design, not
once, but always after his coming into <hi>England,</hi> to reform
that deformity of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> into a decent Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,

and Intermissions, till the year 1616. Where at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi>

Bishop to wear his Rochet, the Minister his Surplice, and
so to inure the people by president of his own Chappel,
there first, and afterwards in all parts for the publick: The
Scotch Bishops liked it reasonable well for the matter, but
the maner of imposing it from hence upon them, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
somewhat too much dependancy of theirs on our
English Church, and therefore excepting against the Psalms,
Epistles and Gospels, and other Sentences of Scripture in the
English Book, being of a different Translation from that of
King <hi>Iames,</hi> they desired a Liturgy of their own, and to
alter the English answerable to that, and so peculiar to the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which indeed was more like to that of
King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, which the Papist better approved,
and so was the rather permitted by the King, as to win them
the better to our Church: And so had it been accustomed
to the Scotish several Churches, for some years without any
great regret, and now particularly proclaimed to be used in

worse then this, not being suffered to carry away their own
Corn, though the Tithes had been set out in convenient time,
before the Impropriator had carried his, by means whereof,
they were kept in a most intollerable slavery by these their
Masters, who cared not many times for losing the tenth part,
so they might destroy the other nine: By means whereof,
the poor Peasants were compell'd to run, swear, fight, to kill,
and be killed too, as they were commanded. From which

                  <p>Ibid <hi>The Crown of</hi> Spain <hi>hath enlarged her bounds these last

of Austria within sixty years from the time that our Author
writ this part of the History hath been upon the losing hand,
the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> with all the appendixes thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
revolted from that Crown, as also are the Countries of
<hi>Catalonia,</hi> and <hi>Rousillon</hi> in the Continent of <hi>Spain</hi> it self;
the lower <hi>Palatinate</hi> surrendred to its lawful Prince accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Treaty at <hi>Munster,</hi> and many of his best Towns,
if not entire provinces in the Netherlands extorted from him
by the <hi>French;</hi> besides the seven united Provinces, which
within the compasse of that time have made themselves a free
state, and are now rather confederates with that King then
Subjects to him; whereas upon the other side the <hi>Ottomans</hi>
within that compasse of time have regained <hi>Babylon</hi> and
all the Countrey there about from the hands of the <hi>Persians,</hi>
and conquered a great part of the Isle of <hi>Candy</hi> from the State

                  <p>Ibid. <hi>The Kings Mercer infected and fled, no purple velvet
to be had on the suddain, and so the colour of his Robes was
changed by necessity.</hi>] This passage is brought in out of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as not relating to the Parliament but the Coronation.
The Author of the former History had told us out of Mr.
<hi>Prinne,</hi> that the King upon the day of his Coronation was
arraied in white Sattin contrary to the custom of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
who were clothed in purple, which change al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the King affected to declare the innocency of his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61619:199"/>
heart, or to expresse that Virgin purity wherewith he came
unto the marriage betwixt him and his Kingdoms; yet our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
would fain have it to be done upon <hi>necessity</hi> and not
upon designe or choice. How so? Because (saies he) <hi>the
Kings Mercer being infected and fled there was no purple velvet
to be had on the suddain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But first, though the <hi>Kings Mercer</hi> was <hi>infected,</hi> and <hi>fled,</hi>
yet there were other Mercers in the City who could have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the King with that commodity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, at the time of the Coronation the infection had
been much abated, the Air of London being generally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by a very sharp winter, and most of the Citizens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
again to their former dwellings; amongst which the
Kings mercer might be one for any thing which our Author
can assure us to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it appears by another passage in our Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that there was <hi>Purple velvet</hi> enough <hi>to be had</hi> for this
occasion, he telling us out of Mr. <hi>Fullers</hi> Church History,
(out of whom he borrows his description of the Coronation)
that the train of the Kings vest or Royal Robe consisted of <hi>six
yards of purple velvet.</hi> Some purple velvet then was to be had
at the Coronation, though the Kings Mercer were infected and
had left the City.</p>
                  <p>And finally there was no such need that any such provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should be made <hi>on a suddain</hi> neither, there being ten
moneths from the Kings coming to the Crown and his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation,
and as much time for providing a few yards of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as for preparing all the other royal necessaries which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
that day.</p>

gave him, without Conditions, two Subsidies from Protestants,
and four from Papists.</hi>] And candid they had been indeed, if
on so fair an auditing of the Kings Account for all expences,
as well past as to come, they had given unto him such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61619:200"/>
supply, as would have equalled that account toward the
carrying on of the War which themselves projected, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
those two Subsidies over and above as a Testimony of
their good Affections to his sacred Person: But these two
Subsidies from Protestants, and four from Papists, were so

especially considering to how low a pitch the Book of
Subsidies was fallen.</p>
                  <p>Our Author tells us somewhere in this present <hi>History,</hi>
that in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time a single Subsidy amounted to
Ninety thousand pound, and that in these times, whereof he
writes a single subsidy of four shillings in the pound, amounts
but to fifty six thousand only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I am able to tel our Author,
that in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, a single Subsidy
of four shillings in the pound, amounted to eight hundred
thousand pound sterling, as appears by this passage in <hi>I. Stow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

accompanied with divers Lords, both Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
acquainted the House of Commons with the Kings ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of waging war against the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, &amp;
thereupon required a Subsidy of 800000 <hi>l.</hi> to be raised by 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the pound out of every mans Estate throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61619:200"/>
and that it was accorded by the Commons after
a long and serious debate upon the matter to give two
shillings in the pound, which by his calculation did amount
to 400000 <hi>l.</hi> But then he is to know with all that in the
raising of Subsidies in that Kings time, there was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an oath prescribed to the Assessors to give a perfect valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of all mens estates as far as they could understand them,
but an oath imposed also on the subjects who were to pay it,
to bring in a true and just account of their Estates, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
penalties injoyn'd if they did the contrary, as of late
times upon Delinquents, (as they call them) when they were
admitted to compound at Goldsmiths and Haberdashers
Halls; which course held also all the time of King <hi>Edwards</hi>
Reign, but being intermitted in Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, on good reasons of State, the Subsidies were
brought so low by little and little, that before the death of
the last Queen, they came not up to an hundred thousand,
and sunk so sensibly in the time of King <hi>Iames,</hi> that they
came not to above sixty thousand or thereabouts; so that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Parliament, in the one and twentieth of that
King, bestowed upon him three Subsidies and three Fifteens,
when they first ingaged him in this War, yet King <hi>Charls</hi>
told them in his first Speech to this very Parliament, that
those supplies <hi>held no Symmetry or proportion with the charge of
so great an enterprize:</hi> And though the charges of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
which he was in hand with, much exceeded his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
(as much as the addition of a Navy of an hundred and
twenty sail could amount unto) and that he prest them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
at <hi>Oxford</hi> to a further grant; yet nothing more could
be obtained, but that sorry pittance, sufficient onely for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
money for ingaging those Sea and Land Forces which
he had provided, by means whereof the Expedition proved
dishonorable to the King and Kingdom: Nor came these
two Subsidies so clearly and so candidly from them, but that
the King was fain to gratifie them in two points which they
mainly drove at; that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to say, the granting them a publick

Fast to begin their Parliament, and laying some restraints on
the Lords Day, which never could be obtain'd from any of

                  <p>For when such Fasts had first been moved in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi>
time, and afterwards in all the Parliaments of King
<hi>Iames,</hi> till the 21 of his Reign; it was answered, that there

when the Commons in the 23 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no hopes of gaining any such Fast by the Queens Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
had voted one to be solemniz'd at the Temple
Church, for such of their own Members as could convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be present at it, upon notice thereof, the Queen sent a
Message to them by Sir <hi>Thomas Henneage,</hi> then Vice-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,
declaring with what admiration she beheld that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment
on her Royal Authority, <hi>in committing such an
apparent innovation without her privity or pleasure first known:</hi>
On the receit of which sharp Message, the House desired
Mr. Vice-Chamberlain to present their submission to the
Queen, and to crave her pardon, for which Consult the Book
entituled, <hi>The Free-holders grand Inquest,</hi> pag. 57. No news
of any such attempt in all the rest of her Reign, nor of any
Parliament Fasts (as far as I can remember) till the 21 of King
<hi>Iames,</hi> when they first engaged him in this War; whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
followed by King <hi>Charls,</hi> who indeed was not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to dispute the point, gave such incouragement to the
Commons, that no Parliament could begin without them,
and gave them such an head at last, as to appoint and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
Fasts by their own Authority, not onely without the
Kings consent, but against the very express words of his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61619:201"/>
Proclamations: How well this Fast was kept by some lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Members when they had procured it, that is to say, with
a good neck of Mutton and broath in the Morning, a Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sweet Meats between the Sermons, and a Sabbatari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Supper in the Evening; I could make known by a very
memorable story, had I list and leisure: <hi>And what ill use was
made of another in the Pulpits, Prayers and Sermons, of many
seditious Lectures, to stir up and continue the War rais'd against
this King,</hi> appears by his Proclamation of the fifth of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Anno</hi> 1643. by which he endeavored to translate the
then Monethly Fast, from the second <hi>Wednesday</hi> to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Friday</hi> in every Moneth, but without success: Of this
indulgence of the Kings, our Author takes no notice, as he
doth of the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the laying of such a restraint from
Recreations on the Lords day, as never had been known in
this Kingdom since the Reformation: Concerning which, he
telleth us that,</p>
                  <p>Fol. 13. <hi>These Lawes are enacted this Sessions</hi> viz <hi>against A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses
committed on Sundayes &amp;c.</hi>] Now it appeareth by the
Act that the Abuses (as he calls them) which were prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
at that time, were first the <hi>Concourse of people out of
their own Parishes on the Lords-day for any sports or Pastims
whatsoever; and secondly the use of Bull-baiting, Bear-baiting,
Enter ludes common plaies and other unlawful exercises and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes
used by any person or persons within their own parishes.</hi>
In the composure of which Act, the first clause made against
the concourse of people out of their own Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ishes on that day
was purposely intended for a counterballance to the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of King <hi>Iames</hi> about <hi>lawful sports:</hi> and was afterwards
made use of by some publick ministers of Justice, to suppresse
the Annual feasts of the dedication of Churches, commonly
called and known by the name of <hi>Wakes.</hi> Such feasts of love,
and entertainments of good Neighbour-hood, though they
drew some People out of their own Parishes, were no abuses in
themselves, though so called by our Author. And as for
Bull-baiting, Bear-baiting, and the rest there mentioned,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61619:202"/>
they had been all prohibited by a Proclamation of King <hi>Iames</hi>
bearing date the 7. of <hi>May,</hi> in the first year of his Reign
<hi>Anno</hi> 1603. Nor were they used upon that day (for ought
that I am able to call to mind) in all the time of my Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
So that this Parliament by interdicting those rude Sports
did but <hi>actum agere,</hi> save that they gained unto themselves
the reputation of more then ordinary Zeal to the day of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and laid the first foundation of those many Rigor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
which afterward they imposed upon it. For in the next Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
of this King, they passed an Act that <hi>no Carrier with
any horse or horses, no Waggon men with any waggon or wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
nor Carmen with any Cart or Carts, nor Wain-men with
any wain or waines, nor any Drovers with Cattle should fourty
dayes next after the end of that Session by themselves, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
travel upon the said day, upon pain that every person or
persons so offending should forfeit 20.s. for every such offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
and that no Butcher after the said time should kill or sell
any Flesh upon that day, on the forfeiture of 6s. 8 d. toties quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi>
Matters whith had been moved in Parliament, in the
18 year of K. <hi>Iames,</hi> but without success, the Lords unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
opposing the Bill, when sent up by the Commons,
as tending to the disturbance of the Trade of the Kingdom,
and some inconveniencies to the Poor: But having brought
the King to a condition of denying nothing, they obtain'd
this also of him as they had done the other, and at last became
their own Carvers; imposing since the first beginning of the
long Parliament, by their Orders and Ordinances, so many
several restraints on that day from all kindes of lawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and civil businesses, that greater never were imposed
on the Jews by the Scribes and Pharisees, nor by some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
on the Papists, nor by Dr. <hi>Bound,</hi> (the first Broacher
of these Sabbath-speculations in the Church of <hi>England)</hi>
on his Puritan Proselytes.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding these condescensions of the King to
the desires of the Commons, the Commons were resolv'd to
condescend in nothing to the desires of the King, unless as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61619:202"/>
they had moved the war so they might also be made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Kings Design in the conduct of it, which point
they prest with such importunity that the King commanded
M. <hi>Glanvil.</hi> to serve as Secretary to the Navy for that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
that knowing all the secrets and intentions of it
when he was at Sea, he might acquaint the members with it
at his coming back.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 20. <hi>For</hi> Mansel <hi>was vice-Admiral of the Narrow Seas,
thats his Office, and there indeed he succeeds to the Admiral:</hi>]
Our Author is as much out in this particular, as the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
had been in another. The Mariners thought (if Mr.
<hi>H. L.</hi> report them rightly) that <hi>Sr. Robert Mansel</hi> the then
vice-Admiral had <hi>an unquestionable right to the chief conduct
of that Enterprise upon the Dukes default.</hi> The Mariners in
this point sailed without their compasse, as is proved by the
Observator. And this our Author building upon the <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator</hi>
calls a <hi>Monstrous Error,</hi> although not half so <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous</hi>
as that <hi>Error</hi> which himself committeth in making
this, <hi>Sr. Robert Mansel,</hi> to be no other then the <hi>vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of the Narrow seas</hi> and restraining his <hi>Office</hi> and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to those Seas alone. But had he consulted with the
Sailers (as Mr. H. L. may be thought to have done) they
would have told him that Sr. <hi>Robert Mansel</hi> was vice Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of England, and that it belonged unto his Office next
under the Admiral, to see the Royal Navie kept in good
reparation, the wages of the Mariners and shiprights to be
duly paid, and that the ships should be provided of all
things necessary for any occasionall expedition. They could
have told him also that there is no such Officer as a Vice-Admiral
of the narrow Seas, but that those narrow Seas are
commanded by two several Admirals, which hold their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from the King, and not by grant or patent from the
Lord Admiral of England; and that one of these Admirals
commandeth in the East and the other in the Western part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of those Seas: And finally, that at the time of his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Sr. <hi>Henry Palmer</hi> was Vice-Admiral of the Eastern parts

of those Seas, and a West<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Fol. 18. <hi>This Gentleman was second Son of Thomas Cecil
Earl of Exeter. &amp;c.</hi>] Our Author speaks this of Sr. <hi>Edward
Cecil,</hi> created by King <hi>Charles</hi> in the first year of his Reign
Lord <hi>Cecil</hi> of <hi>Putney,</hi> and <hi>Viscount Wimbleton,</hi> and by the
King made Commander General of his first Fleet against the
Spaniards; concerning whom he falls into several Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
                  <p>For first, Sr <hi>Edward Cecil</hi> was not the second, but the
third son of <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Exeter,</hi> the second Son being
<hi>Sr. Richard Cecil</hi> of <hi>Walkerly</hi> in the County of <hi>Rutland,</hi> the
Father of that <hi>David Cecil</hi> who succeeded in the <hi>Earldom</hi> of
<hi>Exeter,</hi> after the death of Earl <hi>William,</hi> eldest Son of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this Sr. <hi>Edward Cecil</hi> was not of a Colonel <hi>made</hi>
General <hi>of the</hi> English <hi>forces</hi> in the unhappy war of the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate.
He was indeed made General of the <hi>English</hi> forces
in the war of <hi>Cleve, Anno</hi> 1610. the power which his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
Sr. <hi>Robert Cecil</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> had with King <hi>Iames</hi>
advancing him to that imployment. But that he was not
General of the English forces in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> war, I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
confident; Sr. <hi>Horace Vere,</hi> one of a more noble extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a far better Souldier being chief Commander in that

                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61619:205"/>
Rex, <hi>I grant and promise so to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then one of the Bishops reads this admonition to the King
before the People, with a loud voice,</hi> Our Lord and King,
we beseech you to pardon, and to grant, and to preserve unto us,
and to the Churches committed to our charge, all Canonical
Priviledges, and due Law and Iustice, and that you would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
and defend us, as every good King in his Kingdom ought to
be a Protector and Defender of the Bishops, and the Churches
under their Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King answereth,</hi> With a willing and devout heart I
promise and grant my Pardon, and that I will preserve and
maintain to you, and the Churches committed to your charge, All
Canonical Priviledges, and due Law and Iustice; and that I
will be your Protector and Defender to my power, by the assistance
of God, as every good King ought in his Kingdom, in right to
protect and defend the Bishops, and Churches under their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>Then the King ariseth, and is led to the Communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
where he makes a solemn Oath, in sight of all the
People, to observe the premises; and laying his hand upon
the Book, saith, <hi>The things which I have before promised, I
shall perform and keep, So help me God, and the contents of this
Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such was the Oath taken by the King at his Coronation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which I finde these two Objections.</p>
                  <p>First, That it was not the same Oath which anciently had
been taken by his Predecessors, and for the proof thereof, an
Antiquated Oath was found out, and publisht in a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
of the Lords and Commons, bearing date the twenty
sixth of <hi>May,</hi> 1642.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, It was objected in some of the Pamphlets
of that time, that the Oath was falsified by D. <hi>Laud,</hi> Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to make it more to the Kings advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and less to the benefit of the Subject then it had been
formerly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:61619:205"/>
For answer whereunto, the King remits the Lords and
Commons to the Records of the Exchequer, by which it
might be easily prov'd that the Oath was the very same <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim,</hi>
which had before been taken by his Predecessors, Kings
and Queens of this Realm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And to the Pamphleters, it is answered by Mr.</hi> H. L. <hi>the
Author of the former History,</hi> That there was no variation
from the old forms, but the addition of a clause to a Prayer there
mentioned; and that this var<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ation was not the solitary act of
<hi>Laud</hi> alone, but of a Committee: And this <hi>(saith he) I</hi> posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
assert, as minding the reformation of a vulgar Error
thrown abroad in loose Pamphlets, that Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> altered the
Coronation Oath; whereas the Oath it self was precisely the same,
with former precedents: <hi>More candidly in this, then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the present History, how great a Royalist soever he
desires to be reckoned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fol. 31. <hi>This necessary Message produced no other supply
then this insolency from a Member, Mr.</hi> Clement Cook, <hi>It is
better</hi> (says he) <hi>to dye by a foreign Enemy, then to be destroyed
at home.</hi>] And this seditious speech of his, was as seditiously
seconded by one Dr. <hi>Turner,</hi> of whom the King complain'd
to the House of Commons, but could finde no remedy, nor
was it likely that he should: He that devests himself of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and Original power, to right the injuries which are
done him, in hope to finde relief from others, (especially
from such as are parcel-guilty of the wrong) may put up all
his gettings in a Semtress thimble, and yet never fill it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
thus King <hi>Iames</hi> had done before him, one <hi>Piggot,</hi> a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the House of Commons, had spoken disgracefully of
the Scots, for their importunity in begging, and no less scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
of the King, for his extream profuseness in giving, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
withal, that it would never be well with <hi>England,</hi> till a
<hi>Sicilian Vesper</hi> was made of the Scotish Nation: For which
seditious Speech, when that King might have took the Law
into his own hands, and punisht him as severely by his own
Authority, as he had deserv'd, yet he past it over, and thought
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61619:206"/>
that he had done enough in giving a hint of it in a Speech
made to both Houses at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> on the last of <hi>March,
Anno 1607. I know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that there are many</hi> Pigots <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, <hi>I</hi> mean a number of Seditious and discontented
particular persons, as must be in all Commonwealths, that where
they dare, may peradventure talk lewdly enough; but no</hi> Scotish
<hi>man ever spoke dishonorably of</hi> England <hi>in Parliament: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the custom of those Parliaments, that no man was to speak
without leave from the Chancellor,</hi> (for the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
made but one House in that Kingdom) <hi>and if any man
do propound or utter any seditious Speeches, he is straightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
and silenced by the Chancellors Authority.</hi> This said,
there was an end of that business for ought I can learn; and
this gave a sufficient encouragement to the Commons in the
time of King <hi>Charls,</hi> to expect the like: From whence they
came at last to this resolution, <hi>not to suffer one of theirs to be
questioned, till themselves had considered of his crimes: Which</hi>
(as our Author truly notes) <hi>kept them close together, imboldned
thus, to preserve themselves to the last,</hi> fol. 35. This Maxim
as they made use of in this present Parliament, in behalf of
<hi>Cook, Diggs,</hi> and <hi>Eliot,</hi> which two last had been Imprisoned
by the Kings command; so was it more violently and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciously
insisted on in the case of the <hi>five Members,</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peacht
of High Treason by the Kings Attorney, on the fourth
of <hi>Ianuary, Anno</hi> 1641. the miserable effects whereof, we
still feel too sensibly.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 40 <hi>And though the matter of the Prologue may be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
being made up with Elegancy, yet rather then it shall be lost,
you may please to read it at this length.</hi>] Our Author speaks this
of the Eloquent Oration made by Sir <hi>Dudly Diggs,</hi> to usher
in the Impeachment of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amplified and prest in six tedious Speeches, by <hi>Glanvil,
Pim, Selden, Wansford, Herbert,</hi> and <hi>Sherland,</hi> was Epilogued
by Sir <hi>Iohn Eliot:</hi> A vein of Oratory not to be found in the
Body of the English Parliament, till the time of King <hi>Iames.</hi>
Its true, that on the Petition of the Commons, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61619:206"/>
of each Parliament, the King was graciously pleas'd
to indulge them a freedom of reasoning and debate upon all
such points as came before them, and not to call them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
though they delivered their opinions contrary to his
sence and meaning: But then it is as true withal, that they
used not to waste time in tedious Orations, nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
against the proceedings of the King, and the present
Government; or if they did, the Speaker held it for a part
of his Office to cut them short, and to reminde them of their
duty, besides such after-claps as they were sure to finde from
an injured and incensed Soveraign.</p>

that Sr. <hi>Edward Montague,</hi> commonly called Lord <hi>Mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>

To merit which, and to avoid the danger which might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to him by <hi>Bests</hi> acquaintances he betook himself to the
wars of <hi>Ireland;</hi> where he performed such signal service a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

he came at last to be made Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at what
time he was created viscount <hi>Grandison,</hi> with reference to the

dignity entailed on him, and the heires males of his body,

                  <p>Fol. 62. Carlton <hi>gone upon this Errand, and missing the</hi>
French <hi>King at</hi> Paris, <hi>progressed a tedious journey after that
Court to</hi> Nantes <hi>in Bohemia.</hi>] And here we have as great an
Error in <hi>Geography,</hi> as before in <hi>Heraldry,</hi> there being no such
Town as <hi>Nantes</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> or if there were, it had been too
farre off, and too unsafe a place for a Summers progress. It
is <hi>Nantes</hi> in <hi>Bretaigne</hi> which he means, though I am so cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
as to think this to be a mistake rather of the Printer
than our Authors own. With the like charity also I behold
three other mistakes, viz. <hi>the Emperor of Vienna</hi> fol. 137. and
<hi>the Archdutchesse of Eugenia fol.</hi> 139. &amp; Balfoure Caselie, for
Bolsovey Castle fol 192. By which the unknowing Reader
may conceive, if not otherwise satisfied, that <hi>Balfour Castle</hi>
was the antient seat of the <hi>Balfours</hi> from whence Sr. <hi>William
Balfour</hi> Lieutenant of the Tower (that false and treacherous
Servant to a bountifull Master) derives his pedigree; <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
(which was a part of that Ladies Christian name) to be
the name of some Province, and <hi>Vienna</hi> (the usual place of
the <hi>Emperors</hi> residence) to be the name of an Empire. But
for his last I could alledg somewhat in his excuse, it being no
unusual thing for Principalities and Kingdomes to take De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
from their principal Cities. For besides the Kings
of <hi>Mets Orleans</hi> and <hi>Soissons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> we finde that in the
Constitutions of <hi>Howel Dha,</hi> the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Kings of <hi>London,</hi> the Kings of South-Wales Kings of <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuor,</hi>
and the King of North-Wales Kings of <hi>Aberfraw,</hi>
each of them from the ordinary place of their habitation.
For which defence if our Author will not thank me, he must
thank himselfe. The mention of <hi>Nantes</hi> conducts me on to
<hi>Count Shally's</hi> Treason against the <hi>French</hi> King, who was
beheaded in that City; of which thus our Author.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 63. <hi>The</hi> Count <hi>upon Summons before the Privy Councel
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61619:208"/>
without more adoe, was condemned and forthwith beheaded at
Nantes: the</hi> Duke Momerancy <hi>then under Restraint suffered
some time after.</hi>] But by his leave the Duke of <hi>Monmorency</hi>
neither suffered on the account of <hi>Shalley's</hi> Treason, nor ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
soon after his beheading, which was in the year 1626. as
our Author placeth it. For being afterwards enlarged, and
joyning with <hi>Mounsier</hi> the Kings Brother in some designe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>King,</hi> or the <hi>Cardinal</hi> rather, he was defeated and
took prisoner by Martial <hi>Schomberg</hi> (created afterwards
Duke of <hi>Halwyn)</hi> and being delivered over to the Ministers
of Justice, was condemned and beheaded at <hi>Tholouse,</hi> Anno
1633.</p>

within the Dukedome of <hi>Bretaigne;</hi> neither of which, nor
of any other of the inferior Parliaments, are able to doe any
thing <hi>Extra Sphaeram Activitatis suae,</hi> beyond their several
Bounds and Limits. And therefore this Arrest must either be
made by Order from the Parliament of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> the Town

                  <p>Fol. 92. <hi>At his death the Court was suddenly filled with Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
knowing by removes, preferments would follow to many,</hi>
expected advancements by it.] Our Author speaks this of the
death of Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> and of the great resort of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
to the Court, which ensued thereupon, making them
to tarry there on the expectation of Preferment and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves,
as his death occasioned, till they were sent home by
the Court Bishops, with the Kings Instructions: But in this
our Author is mistaken, as in other things: The Bishops
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61619:209"/>
were not sent home with the Kings Instructions till after
<hi>Christmas, Anno</hi> 1629. and Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> dyed in the

Bishop of <hi>Oxon</hi> the 17 day of <hi>October</hi> of the same
year, so that between the filling up of these Removes, and
the sending the Bishops home with the Kings Instructions,
there happened about 15 Moneths, so that the great resort
of Bishops about the Court, <hi>Anno</hi> 1627. when they were
sent back with the Kings Instructions, was not occasioned
by the expectation of such Preferments and Removes, as
they might hope for on the death of Bishop <hi>

and heir to the Lady</hi> Hatton, <hi>by her former Husband, and
Wife to the Viscount</hi> Purbeck <hi>Brother to the Duke, passed the
tryall for adultery,</hi> &amp;c.] Our Author is here out again in
his <hi>Heraldry,</hi> the Lady <hi>Purbeck</hi> not being Daughter to the
Lady <hi>Hatton</hi> by her <hi>former Husband,</hi> but by her second Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
Sr. <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> then Attorny Generall, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
successively Chief Justice of either Bench. Yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not but that <hi>she was an Heir and a rich marriage,</hi> as it after
followeth. For being Daughter to <hi>Thomas Cecil</hi> Earl of
<hi>Exeter,</hi> she was married by the care and providence of her
Grandfather, the Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> to Sr. <hi>William Newport,</hi>
who being the adopted sonne of the Lord Chancellor
<hi>Hatton,</hi> succeeded in his name as well as in his Lands. In
ordering of which marriage it was agreed on, that the vast
Debt which the Chancellor owed unto the Crown, should
be estalled to small Annual payments; and that in lieu thereof,
Sr. <hi>William</hi> in defect of issue, should settle on his wife and
her Heires, by any Husband whatsoever, the Isle of <hi>Purbeck,</hi>
and some other of the out parts of his Estate. By means
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61619:209"/>
whereof her Daughter <hi>Frances</hi> which she had by Sr. <hi>Edward
Coke</hi> was heir to <hi>Corse</hi> Castle in the Isle of <hi>Purbeck,</hi> and so
much of the rest of the Lands of <hi>Hatton,</hi> as the mother
(being a woman of great expence) did not sell or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liene.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 106. <hi>The King for all his former Arrears of</hi> loan, <hi>was
put to it to borrow more: of the Common Councel of</hi> London
120000. <hi>l. upon Mortgage on his own land of 21000. l.</hi> per an.]
And here I think our Author is Mistaken also, the Citizens not
lending their money upon <hi>Mortgage,</hi> but laying it out in
the way of purchase. Certain I am, that many goodly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
lying at the foot of <hi>Ponfract-Castle,</hi> and appertaining
to the Crown in right of the Duchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> were sold
out-right unto the Citizens at this time; and therefore I
conclude the like also of all the rest. But whether it were so
or not, I cannot chuse but note the sordid basenesse of that
City in refusing to supply their King in his great Necessities,
without Sale or Mortgage; especially when the mony was
to have been expended in defence of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> whose
cause they seemed so much to favour.</p>
                  <p>But for this and other refusals of this nature, the Divine
vengeance overtook them within few years after; the long
Parliament draining them of a Million of pounds and more,
without satisfaction, for every hundred thousand pound which
the King desired to borrow of them upon good security,
so peny wise, and so pound foolish was that stubborn
City.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 107. <hi>Which we shall refer to the subsequent time and
place fitting. But of those in their due place hereafter.</hi>] Our
Author had found fault with the <hi>Observator,</hi> for saying that
the King had not done well in excluding the Bishops from
their Votes in Parliament; and that there was some strange
<hi>improvidence in his Message from York,</hi> June 17. <hi>where he
reckons himself as one of the three Estates, a Member of the
House of Peers:</hi> But why he thus condemneth the <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
we must seek elsewhere, which is a kinde of <hi>Hallifax</hi>

Tryal: Seek then we must, and we have sought (as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth)
<hi>in subsequent time and place fitting, in their due place
hereafter,</hi> as the phrase is varied: But neither in the latter
end of the year, 1641. when the Bishops were deprived of
their Votes in Parliament, nor in all the time of the Kings
being at <hi>York, Anno</hi> 1642. can we finde one word which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to either of those points: In which our Author deals
with the <hi>Observator,</hi> as some great <hi>Criticks</hi> do with their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi>
who when they fall on any hard place in <hi>Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
or any of the old <hi>Poets</hi> or <hi>Philosophers,</hi> which they
cannot master, adjourn the explication of it to some other
place, where they shall have an opportunity to consider of
both Texts together: Not that they ever mean to touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, but in a hope that either the Reader will be so negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,

his Sentence (amongst other things) that he should
be Imprisoned during the pleasure of the Parliament, pay a

of all Ecclesiastical Preferments for the time to come, which

stood either at the granting of a Subsidy, or time of payment,
when all we have is her Majesties, and she may lawfully at
her pleasure take it from us, and that she had as much right
to all our Lands and Goods, as to any Revenue of the
Crown, and that he had presidents to prove it:</q> For which,
see the Book called, <hi>The Free-holders grand Inquest,</hi> pag. 62.
<hi>But some may better steal a Horse, then others look on,</hi> as the
saying is; the Serjeant being never questioned, and the poor
Doctor sentenced (and justly, as our Author makes it) to an
absolute ruine, if the King had not been more merciful to
him then the Commons were.</p>
                  <p>From Dr. <hi>Manwaring,</hi> our Author proceeds to the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator,</hi>
for saying, that Doctrinal matters delivered in the
Pulpit, are more proper for the cognizance of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the High Commission, then the House of Commons,
which though it may consist most times of the wisest Men, yet
it consists not many times of the greatest Clerks: For, saith
he,</p>
                  <p>Fol. 116. <hi>That the Preacher is</hi> Jure Divino, <hi>not to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
but by themselves, smells of the Presbyter or Papist.</hi>] But
<hi>Sir,</hi> by your good leave, neither the Presbyter nor the Papist
stand accused by our Orthodox Writers, for not submitting
themselves, their Doctrines and Opinions to the power of
Parliaments, who neither have, nor can pretend to any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in those particulars: That which they stand accused
for is, that they acknowledge not the King <hi>to be the supream
Governor over all persons in all causes, as well Ecclesiastical as
Civil, within his Dominions;</hi> and consequently decline his
Judgement as incompetent, when they are called to answer
unto any charge which is reducible to an Ecclesiastical or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
nature: How stiff the Papists are in this point, is known
well enough by their refusing to take the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</p>
                  <p>And for the peremptoriness of the Presbyterians, take this

which the Conquerour upon his admittance, had declared and

this of an hereditary Freedom which is supposed to have

to the King, but by Act of Parliament. And I would fain
learn so much of him as to direct me to some creditable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
in which I may finde this pretended contract between
the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerour and the <hi>English</hi> Subject, and in what
Book of Statutes I may finde these <hi>Laws</hi> which were publisht
by him to that purpose. The <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerour knew his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61619:214"/>
own strength too well to reign <hi>precariò,</hi> to ground his Title
on his admittance by the people, or to make any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
with them, by which he might more easily win them
to that admittance. He won the Kingdome by his sword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and by that he kept It. 'Tis true, that the people did peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

in which such an immunity from extraordinary Taxes
might be granted to them. But I cannot finde that either he
or <hi>William Rufus</hi> who succeeded, did ever part with so much
of their powet as not to raise money on the Subject for their
own occasions whensoever they pleased. And it is true also,
that both King <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. and K. <hi>Steven,</hi> who came to the
Crown by unjust or disputable Titles, did flatter the people,
when they first entred on the Throne, with an hope of resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the said Laws; but I cannot finde that ever they were
so good as their words, nay, I finde the contrary. The first
of our Kings which gave any life to those old Laws, was
King <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. the first granter of the <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> which
notwithstanding he kept not so exactly as to make it of any
strength and consequence to binde his Heirs. But the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
having once tasted the sweetnesse of it, and with the

Concerning which we finde no old Statute or Act of
Parliament, which did enable the King to receive them,
though some there be by which the King did binde himself
to a lesser rate then formerly had been laid upon some

<hi>Edward</hi> 3. <q>where it is said that neither we nor our Heirs shall
demand, assesse, nor take, nor suffer to be taken more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome

Custome. And the Sack ought to contain 26. stone, and
every stone 14. pound.</q> By which it seems that there had
been both Customes and <hi>old Customes</hi> too, which the Kings
of <hi>England</hi> had formerly imposed on those commodities,
now by the goodnesse of this King abated to a lesser summe,

any regret or complaint of the Merchants, as our Authour
tels us. And in the first he tels us true, but not so in the last.
For the Merchants having fee'd some Members of the House
of Commons to befriend them in it, it was moved that some
course might be taken by the House to ease the Merchants in
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

unto the Speaker, desired that that businesse might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
no further; affirming that it was a <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> part
of the Queens prerogative Royall, and therefore not to be
disputed within those wals; adding w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

any further, he must (as he was in duty bound) acquaint
her Majesty with the matter, of whose displeasure they would
quickly finde themselves to be very sensible. And so the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
stopt for that time, though it broke out afterwards,
but little to the benefit of the Merchant, as <hi>in fine</hi> it proved.
It seems by this story that the Commons challenged no such
priviledge in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, as they did afterwards
in the time of King <hi>Charles,</hi> that is to say, that neither the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61619:216"/>
King nor Queen was to take notice of any thing which was
said or done within those Walls, until it was communicated
to them by the consent of the House: For whereas the King
in a Speech made to both Houses, on the 14 of <hi>December,</hi>
1641. took notice of some dispute which had been raised in
that House, about the Kings power in pressing Soldiers for
his Wars, the Commons voted this for a breach of Priviledge,
and gain'd so far upon the Lords, that they joyn'd together
in this Declaration to his Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esty, viz. <hi>That amongst other
priviledges of Parliament, it was their ancient and undoubted
right, that his Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>sty ought not to take notice of any matter in
Agitation and debate in either House of Parliament, but by
their Information and Agreement:</hi> But yet as ancient as it was,
the yongest man present had seen the beginning; and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
as it was, the oldest man there sitting liv'd to see the

who had been guilty of that most unparallel'd Ryot,
which was committed in the House of Commons, at the

is strange to me, and so I think it is to any who are verst in
the actions of those times; it being the generall opinion of
our Historians, that he fell into the Queens displeasure for
being a chief Patron and promoter of it. Certain it is, that
he wrote a large Letter to the Queen in defence of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesyings,

the better to manage and improve their encreasing

him that he did it for no other reason, but because he
knew what a great exasperation it would give the King, and
consequently how much it must incense him against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.
Away with this Intelligence goes the Lord Keeper
to the King, who took fire thereat as well as he, and though
it was somewhat late at night, commanded him to go to the

For when he first undertook the conduct of it, on the solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation
of the Kings of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and
many of the afflicted and disinherited Princes; he cannot be
supposed to entertain any other thoughts then to restore the
Princes and free Cities to their former Rights, for doing
whereof his Army was defraid by the joynt charges and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the Confederates: In order whereunto he caused
the Inhabitants of all the Towns and Provinces which he had

This as it first discovered his ambition of the first designe

only, though such mistakes condemn our Authour of no
small negligence in not reviewing his own work Sheet by
Sheet, as it came from the Presse, and making an <hi>Errata</hi> to it,
as all Authours carefull of their credit have been used to do.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 230. <hi>And because the Earl of Strathern a bold man,
and had the Kings ear, and deservedly too, being faithfull and
true; these men set on</hi> John Scot (<hi>Director of the Chancery)
a busie person, to inform against his Descent:</hi>] In the story of
this Earl, not only as to his Original and descent, but as to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61619:223"/>
his being Earl of <hi>Menteith</hi> our Authour is not to be faulted;
but on the other side, not to be justified in making him to be
Earl of <hi>Strathern</hi> by the power of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (that Duke
being dead some years before) though by his power made
Lord President of the Council for the Realm of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
Therefore to set this matter right, and to adde something
to our Authour that may not be unworthy of the Readers
knowledge, I am to let him understand, that after the death
of <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern</hi> second Son to King <hi>Robert</hi> the
third, this Title lay dormant in the Crown, and was denied
to the Lord <hi>Dromond</hi> (created afterwards Earl of <hi>Perth</hi>)
when a Suitor for it. But this Gentleman Sir <hi>William Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
Earl of <hi>Menteith</hi> descended from an Heir General of that
<hi>David,</hi> a man of sound abilities and approved affections,
was by the King made Lord President of the Councill of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> as before is said; In which place he so behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and stood so stoutly in behalf of the King his Master,
upon all occasions, that nothing could be done for advance of
<hi>Hamiltons</hi> designs, till he was removed from that place. In
order whereunto it was put into his head by some of that
Faction, that he should sue unto the King to be created Earl
of <hi>Strathern,</hi> as the first and most honourable Title which
belonged to his House; that his merits were so great as to
assure him not to meet with a deniall, and that the King
could do no lesse then to give him some nominall reward for
his reall services. On these suggestions he repaired unto the
Court of <hi>England,</hi> where without any great difficulty he
obtained his Suit, and waited on the King the most part of
his Summers progresse; no man being so openly honoured
and courted by the Scottish Nation as he seemed to be. But
no sooner was he gone for <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the <hi>Hamiltonians</hi>
terrified the King with the dangers which he had run into by
that Creation, whereby he had revived in that proud and
ambitious person the Rights which his Ancestors pretended
to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as being derived from <hi>David</hi> Earl
of <hi>Strathern</hi> before mentioned, the second Son of <hi>Robert the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61619:223"/>
Second</hi> by his lawfull Wife: that the King could not chuse
but see how generally the <hi>Scots</hi> slockt about him (after this
Creation) when he was at the Court, and would do so much
more when he was in <hi>Scotland:</hi> And finally that the proud
man had already so farre declared himself as to give it ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Faction made the greatest Number) to enquire into
his life and actions, and to consider of the inconveniences
which might redound unto the King by his affecting this
New Title: On the Return whereof, the poor Gentleman
is removed from his Office, from being one of the Privy
Council, and not only deprived of the Title of Earl of <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern,</hi>
but of that also of <hi>Menteith,</hi> which for a long time had
remained in his Ancestors. And though he was not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
made Earl of <hi>Airth,</hi> yet this great fall did so discourage
him from all publike businesses, that he retired to his own
house, and left the way open to the <hi>Hamiltonians,</hi> to play
their own game as they listed. Faithfull for all this to the
King in all changes of Fortune, neither adhering to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters,</hi>
nor giving the least countenance to them, when he
might not only have done it with safety, but with many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
advantages which were tendered to him.</p>

Compare this passage with another, and we shall finde that
our Authour hath mis-reckoned no lesse then fifteen years in

in that particular. <q>What care (saith he) King <hi>Iames</hi> took

obtained an order for satisfaction to be made them out of the

of those Judges being left but <hi>Sir Henry Vane</hi> the Elder, it
was ordered that satisfaction should be given by him to one
of their Widows, and thereupon it was observed for a <hi>blessed

<hi>he could not hold out so many moneths as he did years from

was somewhat more then Sir <hi>Iohn Finch,</hi> he being cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
Lord <hi>Finch</hi> of <hi>Forditch</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>April</hi>
before. Secondly, If he were in any hazard, it was not for
any thing he had done in the place of Lord Keeper, but only
for his zeal to the Kings service in the case of Ship money, or
to his actings under the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> in Forrest businesses,
before he came un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o that place; neither of which could have

did Sir <hi>Francis Windebank,</hi> principal Secretary of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
withdraw into <hi>France;</hi> of whom our Author telleth
us, <hi>That he remained there to his death a profest Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi>
fol. 338.</p>
                  <p>But first, Sir <hi>Francis Windebank</hi> remained not there until
his death, for he came over to the King when he was at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
about the latter end of the year 1643. But finding his
sufferings unregarded, and his Person neglected (as not being
suffered to appear as a Member of the House of Commons,
when the Parliament was summoned thither) he retired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into <hi>France</hi> to his Wife and Children.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, He dyed not a profest Catholick, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to the last a true Son of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacht
in his best fortunes by the name of a Papist, because
preferr'd by the Arch-Bishop, a faithful servant to the Queen,
and a profest enemy to the Puritan Faction: For which last
reason, the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> must be given out to be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
(though I have seen him often at Divine Service in the
Kings Chappel) and is so declared to be by our Author also;
who tells us further, <hi>That finding his native Countrey too hot
for him to hold out,</hi> he went with the Queen Mother unto <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
fol. 428. as if the Land had been hotter for him, or his
Zeal hotter then the place (had he been a Papist, as he was
not) then for any other Noble Man of that Religion.</p>

the Scots, as they would obey his Majesties command not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
so they could not return till they had the effects of their

of the Irish Army, which had been raised in so much haste
by the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> with the beginning of the Spring:
An Army consisting of 10000 Foot, and 1500 Horse, kept
ever since in constant pay and continual Exercise, by which
the King might have reduced the Scots to their due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> declared openly at the Councel
Table, immediately on the dissolving of the former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet now this Army lies dormant, without acting any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61619:225"/>
thing toward the suppressing of the Scots, exprest in their
invading <hi>England,</hi> their wasting the Northern parts of the
Kingdom, and their bold Demands: Which Army, if it
had been put over into <hi>Cumberland,</hi> (to which from the
Port of <hi>Carick-Fergus</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is but a short and easie
passage) they might have got upon the back of the Scots,
and caught that wretched People in a pretty <hi>Pit-fall;</hi> so that
having the English Army before them, and the Irish behinde
them, they could not but be ground to powder, as between
two Mill-stones: But there was some fatality in it, or rather
some over-ruling providence, which so dulled our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
that this Design was never thought of for ought I can
learn; but sure I am that it was never put into Execution:
An Army, of which the prevailing Members in both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
stood in so much fear, that they never left troubling the
King with their importunities, till they had caus'd him to
Disband it; the <hi>Scots</hi> in the mean time nesting in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Counties, and kept at most excessive charges to awe the
King, and countenance their own proceedings.</p>

(which he hath wholly Incorporated part <hi>per</hi>

it, that being composed before <hi>Naseby</hi> fight, it was there
taken with the rest of the Kings Papers, and coming to his
hands again, was by the King committed to the hands of one
Mr. <hi>Symonds,</hi> and by him to the Press: In all which, there
is nothing true but the last particular.</p>
                  <p>For first, That Book, and the Meditations therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were not composed before <hi>Naseby</hi> fight, many of them
relating to subsequent Passages, which the King, without a

and Sufferings,</hi> must needs relate unto the times of his <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
and therefore could not be digested before <hi>Naseby</hi> fight,
when he had been continually exercised in Camp or Counsel,
and not reduc'd to any such <hi>Solitude</hi> as that Title intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, These Papers were not found with the rest in
the Kings Cabinet; or if they were, there must be somewhat
in it above a miracle that he should get them again into his
hands.</p>
                  <p>Assuredly those men who used so much diligence to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
this Book when it was published in print, and many
thousand Copies disperst abroad, would either have burnt it
in the fire, or use some other means to prevent the printing
of it, to their great trouble and disadvantage.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, These papers were not delivered by the King to
Mr. <hi>Symonds,</hi> who had no such near access to him at that

came not to him by purchase, but was resigned by <hi>Henry</hi> of
<hi>Bavaria,</hi> the then Bishop thereof, who being then warred
on by the Duke of <hi>Gelders,</hi> and driven out of the City by
his own Subjects, was not able to hold it: Which resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

                  <p>Secondly, he bought not the Dutchy of <hi>Gelders</hi> neither,

who in regard of the great Succors which he received
from him (when deprived and Imprisoned by his own ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

But this alienation being made unprofitable by the death

                  <p>The proceeding of the short Parliament, and the surviving

on the former <hi>History,</hi> that nothing need be added here:
But the long Parliament, which began in <hi>November</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
will afford us some new matter for these Advertisements
not before observ'd. And first we finde, That</p>
                  <p>Fol. 336. <hi>There came out an Order of the Commons House,
that all Projectors, and unlawful Monopolists, that have or had

out any Warrants in favor of them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall be disabled to sit
in the House.</hi>] A new piece of Authority which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
never exercised before, and which they had no right to
now, but that they knew they were at this time in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as to venture upon any new Incroachment, without
control: For anciently<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and legally the Commons had no
power to exclude any of their Members from their place in
Parliament, either under colour of false elections, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pretence whatsoever: For it appears on good Record, in
the 28 year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that the Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
undertaking the examination of the chusing and
returning of Knights of the Shire for the Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi>
were by the Queen sharply reprehended for it; that
being (as she sent them word) a thing improper for them to
deal in, as belonging onely to the Office and Charge of the
Lord Chancellor, from whom the Writs issue, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.
And if they may not exclude their Members under
colour of undue Elections and false Returns, much less Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
have they to exclude any of them for acting by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Kings. Letters Patents, or doing any thing in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his Majesties Service: For if this power were once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61619:227"/>
them, they might proceed in the next place to shut out
all the Lords of the Privy Councel, his Counsel learned in the
Laws, his Domestick Servants, together with all such as
hold any Offices by his Grant and Favor; because forsooth,
having dependance on the King, they could not be true unto
the Interest of the Commonwealth: And by this means they
might so weed out one another, that at the last they would
leave none to sit amongst them, but such as should be all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
to drive on such projects as were laid before them.</p>
                  <p>But whereas our Author tells us in the following words,
that it was Ordered also, <hi>That Mr. Speaker should issue out
new Warrants for electing other Members in their places;</hi> he
makes the Commons guilty of a greater incroachment then
indeed they were: All that they did or could pretend to in
this case, was to give order to the Speaker, that intimation
might be given to his Majesty of the places vacant, and to
make humble suit unto him to issue out new Writs for new
Elections to those places: But the next Incroachment on the
Kings Authority, was far greater then this, and comes next
in order.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 360. <hi>The Bill for the Trienial Parliament, having p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

both Houses, was confirmed with the Kings Royal Assent,</hi>
Febr. 16. <hi>And then also he past the Bill of Subsidies,</hi> fol. 361.]
The Subsidies here mentioned, were intended for the relief
of the Northern Counties, opprest at once with two great
Armies, who not onely liv'd upon Free Quarter, but raised
divers sums of money also for their present necessities; the
one of them an Army of <hi>English,</hi> rais'd by the King to right
himself upon the <hi>Scots;</hi> the other being an Army of <hi>Scots,</hi>
who invaded the Kingdom, under colour of obtaining from
the King what they had no right to: So that the King was
not to have a peny of that Money, and yet the Commons
would not suffer him to pass the one, till he had before hand
passed the other; which the King, for the relief of his poor
Subjects was content to do, and thereby put the power of
calling Parliaments into the hands of Sheriffs and Constables,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61619:227"/>
in case he either would not, or should not do it at each three
years end: But the nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> incroachment on the Power and
Prerogative Royal was worse then this, there being a way
left for the King to reserve that Power by the timely calling
of a Parliament, and the dissolving of it too, if called with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a shorter time then that Act had limited.</p>
                  <p>But for the next sore, which was his passing of the Bill
of <hi>Tonnage and Poundage,</hi> there was no Plaister to be found;
the King being for'd (remember that the Commons had an
Army of <hi>Scots</hi> at their devotion) to pass away all his Right
unto it, before he could obtain it but for three Moneths one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as was said before: In which Bill it is to be observ'd, that
as they depriv'd the King of his Right to <hi>Tonnage and Pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi>
so they began then to strike at the Bishops Rights to
their Vote in Parliament: For whereas generally in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Acts, the Lords <hi>Spiritual and Temporal</hi> were distinctly
named, in this that distinction was left out, and the Bill
drawn up in the name of the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and Commons; which
being disputed by the Bishops, as well fore-seeing what the
Commons intended by it, was notwithstanding carried for
the Commons by the Temporal Lords, who thereby made a
way for their own exclusion, when the Commons were grown
as much too strong for them, as they were for the Bishops:
The secular Lords knew well, that the Lords Spiritual were
to have the precedence, and therefore gave them leave to go
first out of the House, that they themselves might follow
after as they ought to do.</p>
                  <p>Proceed we next to the business of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
whose Tryal our Author tells us, That</p>
                  <p>Fol. 376. <hi>The Earl of</hi> Arundel <hi>was made Lord High
Steward, and the Earl of</hi> Lindsey <hi>Lord High Constable.</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Our
Author borrows this Error (as he does some others) from the
former <hi>History,</hi> and makes it worse by an addition of his
own.</p>
                  <p>For first, The Earl of <hi>Lindsey</hi> was not made High Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
upon this occasion, nor did he act there in that capacity<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>

He had been made High Constable to decide the difference
between the Lord <hi>Rey</hi> and <hi>David Ramsey;</hi> which being an
extraordinary case was likely to be tried by battle. But in
this case there was no need of any such Officer, the Triall
being to be made by proofs and Evidences, the verdict to be
given by the Lords of Parliament, and sentence to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by the Lord High <hi>Steward,</hi> all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> things being to be
carried and transacted in due form of Law. Secondly, The
Court being broken up, which was before the passing of the
<hi>Bill of Attainder</hi> in the end of <hi>April,</hi> the Office of Lord
High <hi>Steward</hi> expired also with it. And therefore when our
Authour speaks of a <hi>Request</hi> which was made unto the King
in <hi>Parliament,</hi> that the <hi>Earl of Pembroke should be made</hi> Lord
High Steward, <hi>in the place of the Earl of Arundel then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi>
fol. 430. he either speaks of a <hi>Request</hi> which was never
made, or else mistakes the Lord <hi>Steward</hi> of the Kings hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
(which place might possibly be desired for the Earl of
<hi>Pembroke</hi> not long before turn'd out of the Office of Lord
Chamberlain) for the Lord High Steward of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>And now we are fallen on his mistakes touching these
great Officers, I shall adde another, It being said in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
unfigured Sheets, that the King having signed the
Bill of <hi>Attainder, sent Sir</hi> Dudly Carlton <hi>Secretary of State
to acquaint him what he had finished.</hi> An errour too grosse and
palpable for our Authour to be guilty of, considering his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances
in the Court and relations to it; which may
perswade me to beleeve that these unfigured Sheets, patcht
in I know not how, between <hi>fol.</hi> 408. and 409. should be
none of his. But whether they be his or not, certain I am
that there was no Secretary at this time but Sir <hi>Henry Vane,
Windebank</hi> being then in <hi>France,</hi> and his place not filled with
the Lord <hi>Falkland</hi> till the <hi>Christmas</hi> after Sir <hi>Dudly Carlton,</hi>
Lord <hi>Imbercourt,</hi> and Vicount <hi>Dorchester,</hi> was indeed <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
for a while; but he died upon <hi>Ashwednesday</hi> in the year
1631. which was more then nine years before the sending
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61619:228"/>
of this message, and I perswade my self the King did not
raise him from the grave (as <hi>Samuel</hi> was once raised at the
instance of <hi>Saul</hi>) to go on that unpleasing errand. Sir <hi>Dudly
Carlton</hi> whom he means (being Brothers son unto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
was at that time one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>f the Clerks of the Councel, but
never attained unto the place and honour of a principall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary.
Our Authour having brought the businesse of the
Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> toward a Conclusion, diverts upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of the <hi>Observations</hi> on the former <hi>History,</hi> to whom
he had been so much beholden for many of the most mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
and judicious Notes in the former part of his Book; and
he chargeth thus.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 406. <hi>I conceive it convenient in more particular to clear

Primate of all Ireland, whilest he was liuing, and worse pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

What Fee or Salary our <hi>Authour</hi> hath for this undertaking,
I am no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against all the exceptions, which either our Authour
or D. <hi>Bernard,</hi> or the Lord Primate himself have made against
him in these two points. Which being extrinsecall as to the
matter of this History, shall not be repeated; the Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desired, if he want any further satisfaction, to look for it
there. All I shall here observe is this, that our Authour
grounds himself in his whole Discourse of that businesse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
somewhat which he had in writing under the hand of the
said Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> and more which he hath took <hi>verbatim</hi>
out of the said Book of D. <hi>Bernards,</hi> who being both parties
to the Suit, ought not to be admitted for Witnesses in their
own behalf. And yet our. Authour having driven the matter
to as good a conclusion as he could from such faulty Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61619:229"/>
conceives an hope, that by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ight of those <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
he will be of more moderation, notwithstanding he hath there
shewn much disaffection to the Primate, in endeavouring to his
utmost, to evade divers of those particulars, either in giving the
worst sense of them, or turning them to other ends.</hi> But as I can
sufficiently clear the <hi>Observator,</hi> from bearing any disaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> person, and the equal Reader may
defend him from the imputation <hi>of giving the worst sense of
any thing</hi> which he found in the Pamphlet called, <hi>The Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator
observed, or turning it to other ends</hi> then was there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
so am I no more satisfied by this tedious nothing,
touching the Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the death of the Earl of
<hi>Strafford,</hi> as they reflect upon the Archbishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi>
then I was before. As little am I satisfied with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
passage in the last <hi>Folio</hi> of the unfigured Sheets, <hi>viz.</hi>
That</p>
                  <p>D. <hi>Iuxon Bishop of London resigned his Office of Treasurer of
England into the hands of five Commissioners more sufficient
then he could be,</hi>] Our Authour might have spared these last
words of disparagement and diminution, and yet have left
his Proposition full and perfect. But taking them as they
come before me, I must first tell him, that the Lord Bishop
of <hi>London</hi> resigned not his Office of Treasurer into the hands
of any Commissioners, but only into the hands of the King,
who not knowing at the present how to dispose of it for his
best advantage, appointed some Commissioners under the
great Seal of <hi>England</hi> to discharge the same. And next I
would have him tell me, what great sufficiency he found in
those Commissioners, which was not to be found in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>London,</hi> how many of his debts they paid, what
improvement they made of his Revenue, what stock of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
they put him into toward the maintaining of the Warre
which not long after followed. In all which particulars the
Bishop of <hi>London</hi> had very faithfully performed his part
(though not as to the Warre of <hi>England</hi>) to the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the King and content of the Subject.</p>

                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:61619:229"/>But to look back upon some passages in the busines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e of the

of the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> to cheat the poor Gentleman
of his head by getting a return of the promise which the
King is said to have made him of not consenting to his
death. The sum of the story is briefly this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
King had promised the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> under his hand that
his prerogative should sav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him, that he would never passe
the Bill, nor consent to the acting of any thing to take away
his life; that being satisfied in all other scruples he rested
in this only, affirming that in regard of this promise he could
not passe the Bill, though the Earl were guilty; the Bishop
of <hi>Lincoln</hi> finding him harping on that string, assured him,
that he thought that the Earl was so great a Lover of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sties
peace, so tender of his conscience, and the Kingdoms
safety, that he would willingly acquit the King of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
that though the King received this intimation with a
brow of anger, yet the said, Bishop in pursuance of the Earls
destruction, sends a Message to him to that purpose by the
Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> or some other person whom he
found attending near the place; that as the devil and he
would have it the Earl received that intimation with great
disdain, saying, that if that were all which bound the King, he
would soon release him, and thereupon opening his Cabinet,
drew out that Paper in which the Kings promise was contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and gave it to the said Lieutenant or that other person
(but whether sealed or unsealed that he cannot tell) by whom
it was delivered to the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> and finally that
the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> finding no other scruple to remain in
the Kings Conscience, but the respect he had to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
he put the fatall paper into the Kings hands, which as
it seems gave a full end to the conference and the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities.</p>
                  <p>This is the substance of the Legend, and in all this there
is nothing true, but the names of the parties mentioned
in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:61619:230"/>And first I would fain know from what Authour he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this fiction, unlesse it were from <hi>say</hi> I, and <hi>say some</hi> (as
his own words are) that is to say, either from himself, or
from some body else, but he knew not whom. Most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he had it not from any of the Bishops then present, the
Lord Primate affirming in the end of his first Narrative, that
neither he nor the rest of his Brethren knew what was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in that Paper; and no lesse certain it is that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was too wise to accuse himself of such a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
if he had been really guilty of it. And then as for the
thing it self. no man of reason can imagine, that the King
would either make such a <hi>proviso</hi> to the Earl, or that the Earl
would so far distrust his own integrity as to take it of him.
If the Kings knowledge of his innocence, of his signal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and the declaration which he made in Parliament to
the Lords and Commons, that he could not passe the Bill
with a good Conscience, were not sufficient to preserve him,
there was no help to be expected from such Paper-promises.
Such a Romance as this we finde in <hi>Ibrahim the Illustrious Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi>
who is said to have obtained the like promise from <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
the Magnificent; which notwithstanding the <hi>Mufti</hi> or
Chief Priests of the <hi>Turks</hi> devised a way to discharge the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of that promise, and to obtain from him an unwilling
consent to the <hi>Bassa's</hi> death, as the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> is said
to do for the Earl of <hi>Straffords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, There was no such scruple of conscience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to the Bishops in the morning conference as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
which that promise laid upon him; there being no
other question propounded at that time, but whether he
might in justice passe the Bill of <hi>Attainder</hi> against the Earl;
To which the Bishops gave their Answer when it was again
renewed in the Evening (as appears by the Lord Primates
first Narrative) that <hi>if upon the Allegations on either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ide</hi> (at
the hearing whereof the King was present) <hi>he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him guilty of the crime wherewith he was charged he could
not in justice condemn him;</hi> and by this answer it appears that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61619:230"/>
no such scruple as the obligation of that Paper-promise had
been before tendred to the Bishops.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Admitting that the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> might be
so bold as to make that overture to the King, forgetting a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
of that promise from the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> yet was he
too carefull of himself, too fearfull of the Kings everlasting
displeasure, to pursue that fatall project, when he perceived
his Majesty to entertain it <hi>with a brow of anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Admitting this also, that the Bishop was so thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
of the Earls bloud, as to neglect his own safety in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance
of it, yet cannot our Historian tell us, whether that
intimation were sent by the <hi>Lieutenant of the Tower or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
person.</hi> And certainly, as the Lieutenant of the Tower
was not so obscure a person, but that he might easily be
known from another man; so is it most improbable that he
should go on such an errand without speciall order from the
King, or that the Earl should admit of such an intimation
from any other, who was like to run on the Bishops bidding,
but only from the Lieutenant himself.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It cannot be beleeved, that the Earl should fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a passion when the Tale was told him, considering
that he knew, that by a Letter sent unto the King on the
Tuesday before, he had <hi>set the Kings Conscience at liberty,
most humbly beseeching him for the prevention of such mischief
as might happen by his refusall to passe the Bill.</hi> So that the
passing of the Bill could be no News to him, which he had
reason to expect, because it was a thing so much prest by his
enemies, and so humbly and affectionately<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> desired by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and finally, Though our <hi>Historian</hi> make it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
whether that Paper-promise were sent back sealed or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sealed,
yet no man can suspect the Earl to be so imprudent in
his actions, so carelesse of his own honour, and so untrusty
to the King in so great a secret, as to send it open, by which
it must needs come first to the eyes of others before it came
unto the Kings. And if it were not sent unsealed, how came
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61619:231"/>
our Authour to the knowledge that that paper contained the
Kings promise, as he saies it did?</p>
                  <p>But nothing more betrays the vanity and impossibility of
this fiction, then the circumstance in point of time, in which
this promise must be made, which must needs fall between
the passing of the Bill of <hi>Attainder</hi> and the Kings conference
with the Bishops sent to him for the satisfaction of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
by the Houses of Parliament. Our Authour tels us
that at the conference with the Bis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ops, the King being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in all other scruples, <hi>started his last doubt, If in his
Conscience he could not passe the Bill, although the Earl were
guilty; having promised under his hand that his prerogative
should save him, never to passe that Bill, nor to consent to the
acting of any thing to take away his life.</hi> By which it needs
must follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the Bill of <hi>Attainder</hi> was first passed (or at
the least in probability to be passed) in the House of Peers,
before the King had given any such promise under his hand;
for the words are that the King had given him a promise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his hand, never to passe that Bill. Now that Bill was
not taken into consideration in the House of Lords till <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi>
the 24. of <hi>April,</hi> in which considering their own dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and the little satisfaction they are able to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
M. <hi>St Iohn</hi> the Kings <hi>Sollicitor Generall</hi> was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the House of Commons to open the <hi>Bill</hi> before their
Lordships, and to give them information in it, which was
done upon Thursday the nine and twentieth of the same
Moneth. On the next day some of the Lords began to stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in their resolutions, and to incline unto the Commons;
which moved the King to declare himself before both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
on the first of <hi>May, That he could not with a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nce
condemn the Earl of High Treason</hi> (which he must needs
do if he passe that Bill) and therefore <hi>hoped that they would
not expect that from him, which neither fear, nor any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
whatsoever</hi> should enforce him to. Other assurance then
this of not passing the <hi>Bill,</hi> as the King never made the Earl,
so indeed he could not; the Earl being a close Prisoner, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61619:231"/>
so narrowly watcht (especially after his Majesties said De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the first of <hi>May</hi>) that no such Paper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>promise
under the Kings hand could be sent unto him, if either the
King had thought it necessary to make any such promise, or
the Earl to seek it; <hi>Adeo mendaciorum natura est, ut cohere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
non possint,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius</hi> hath it. This point thus cleared,
and the King discharged from making any such promise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his hand, there must some other way be found out to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Earl by devising some means for his escape; and to
this plot the King must be made a party also, our Authour tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us positively, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Some Designe there was no doubt of delivering the Earl of</hi>
Strafford <hi>by escape;</hi> in order whereunto Sir <hi>William Balfour</hi>
Lieutenant of the Tower must be commanded by the King to
receive one <hi>Captain Billingsley with an hundred men to secure
the place.</hi>] If so, how durst <hi>Balfour</hi> refuse to yeeld obedience
to the Kings command? Marry forfooth, because three <hi>good
Women of Tower-street, peeping into the Earls Gallery through
the Key-hole,</hi> could by the Spectacles of their eyes, discern
him talking with this Captain, and by the <hi>Otoco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sticon</hi> of
their ears, could hear them talk of some Desig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e for this
escape; The Summe of their Discourse being this, that a
<hi>Ship of Captain</hi> Billingsleys <hi>Brothers should be in readinesse,
which was fallen down on purpose below in the River, that
they three might be there in twelve hours, that if the Fort
were but secur'd for three or four Moneths, there would come
aid enough, and that there was nothing to be thought upon but
an escape, and much more broken speech to that purpose.</hi> It
seems the womens ears must be very long, and the tongues
both of the <hi>Earl</hi> and <hi>Billingsly</hi> must be very loud; or else how
could a practise of such a close and dangerous nature be so
plainly heard; Assuredly by the same means by which the
<hi>Zealous Brother</hi> in <hi>More, fields,</hi> discovered a dangerous plot
against the Parliament, discoursed of by some who were pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by (but he knows not who they were) as he was sunning
himself under an hedge. Of whom as creditable an Authour
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61619:232"/>
as Sir <hi>William Balfour,</hi> hath told me this, <hi>That while he was
contriving some</hi> Querpo-cut <hi>of Church-Government, by the
help of his out-lying ears, and the Otocousticon of the Spirit,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e discovered such a Plot against the Parliament, that</hi> Selden
<hi>intends to combat Antiquity, and maintain it was a Taylors
Goose that preserved the Capitol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in good earnest, I would fain know of our Author, or
of Sir <hi>William Balfour,</hi> or of both together, whether the
three <hi>Good-Wives of Tower-street,</hi> did hear these Passages in
discourse, by their eyes or their ears: Not by their Eyes,
for the Eye is not the sense of hearing; nor by their Ears,
for it is not said that they laid their Ears to the <hi>Key-hole,</hi> but
that they peeped thorow it.</p>
                  <p>And next I would fain know, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ther they <hi>peep'd</hi> or
<hi>hearkned</hi> all at once, or one after another: If all at once,
the <hi>Key-hole</hi> must be wondrous wide (as <hi>Heavenly-wide</hi> as
<hi>Mopsus mouth in Sir Philip Sidney)</hi> which could admit of
three pair of hearing Eyes, or of three single seeing Ears, at
one time together: And if they <hi>peep'd</hi> or <hi>hearkned</hi> one after
another, they must needs have both very quick Wits, and
strong Comprehensions, that could make up so much of a
set Discourse from such broken Speeches, though they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
spake never so loudly.</p>
                  <p>Letting this pass therefore with a <hi>Risum teneatis Amici<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
we have next a more serious discovery of this Design, by the
Conference which the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> had with Sir <hi>William
Balfour, offering him but four days before his death, no less then
Twenty thousand pounds, and a Marriage of his Daughter to</hi>
Balfours <hi>Son, if he would assent to his Escape:</hi> And for this
also, as well as for the tale of the three <hi>Good-Wives</hi> of <hi>Tower-Street,</hi>
and the command of admitting <hi>Billingsley,</hi> with an
hundred men, to secure the Tower; we must take Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>
bare word (for he gave it not in upon his Oath) in the
House of Commons: And what the bare word of a <hi>Scot,</hi> a
<hi>perfidious Scot,</hi> and one that shortly after took up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Master, will amount unto, we all know too well:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61619:232"/>
Nor was the Earl so ignorant of the hatred which generally
the Scotish <hi>Covenanters</hi> bare unto him, or of the condition
of this man particularly, as to communicate any such design
unto him, had he been so unprepar'd for death, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
makes him: And so this second <hi>Romance</hi> of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Balfour,</hi> and the <hi>three Women Good-Wives of Tower
Street,</hi> being sent after that of the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> we
leave the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> business, and go on with our
<hi>Author</hi> to some other.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 418. <hi>Then follows King</hi> Henry <hi>the fourth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whom
the Lords combined to depose, for there were living of the House
of</hi>

                     </gap>larence <hi>Title to precede that of</hi> Mortimer.] That some
of the Lords combined to depose this King, I shall easily
grant, though not upon those grounds which our <hi>Author</hi>
mingles with the Speech of one Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> (a Member of
the House of Commons) against the Bishops: For though
the Title of <hi>Clarence</hi> did precede that of the King, yet was
not the Kings Title derived from <hi>Mortimer,</hi> the Title of
<hi>Mortimer</hi> and <hi>Clarence</hi> being one and the same.</p>
                  <p>The Title of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, came by his Father,
<hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> the fourth Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
third; the title of <hi>Mortimer</hi> came by <hi>Philip</hi> the sole Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Heir of <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> the third son of
the said King <hi>Edward,</hi> and Wife to <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earl
of <hi>March,</hi> from whom the House of <hi>York</hi> laid their claim
to the Diadem.</p>
                  <p>But our Author is as good at the Pedigree of the House of
the <hi>Beauforts,</hi> as of that of <hi>Mortimer,</hi> telling us, <hi>That Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>
Beaufort <hi>was not onely great Uncle to King</hi> Henry <hi>the
sixth, but Son to</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Gaunt, <hi>and his Brother Cardinal of</hi>
York. The first two parts whereof are true, but the last as
false: <hi>Cardinal Beaufort,</hi> I am sure, had no such Brother as
our Author gives him (for so he must be understood, though
the <hi>Grammar</hi> of the words will not bear so much sense) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
a <hi>Cardinal of York,</hi> unless it were King <hi>Henry</hi> the
fourth, whom <hi>Iohn of Gaunt</hi> had by <hi>Blanch</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:61619:233"/>
his first Wife, <hi>Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> or <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
which two, together with this Cardinal <hi>Beaufort,</hi> he
had by his last Wife <hi>Katherine Swinfort:</hi> More Sons then
these, none of our Heralds or Historians give to <hi>Iohn</hi> of
<hi>Gaunt,</hi> and therefore no such Brother as a <hi>Cardinal of York</hi>
to be found out any where for this <hi>Cardinal Beaufort,</hi> except
onely in our <hi>Authors</hi> Dreams.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 419. <hi>That in</hi> Anno 37. <hi>of</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth, Letters
Patents were granted to Lay-men, to exercise all maner of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Iurisdiction, as the Kings Officers, not the Bishops.</hi>]
These are the words of Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> in his Invective against
the Bishops before mentioned, and these our Author swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
without chewing, not searching whether Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi>
had rightly given the sense of that Act of Parliament or not,
but telling his in his gloss upon it, <hi>That no Reason or Iustice
are to be deduc'd from that Kings Actions, more like an Atheist
then a Christian, either Ecclesiastical or Temporal:</hi> But by the
leave of good Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> there can be no such matter ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from that Statute of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, viz.
<hi>That Letters Patents were granted to Lay-men to exercise all
maner of Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction, as the Kings Officers, not
the Bishops:</hi> Before this time no man could be admitted to
the Office of a Chancellor, Vicar-General, Commissary, or
Official in any Ecclesiastical Court, or exercise any Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Jurisdiction, except he were a single person, and in
<hi>Holy Orders:</hi> To take away which curb, and thereby to give
the better incouragement to Students in the Civil Laws, it
was Enacted by this Statute, that all such Ecclesiastical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
whether made by the Kings Letters Patents as in the
case of Sir <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> the Kings Vicar General) or
by any Arch-Bishop, Bishop, or Arch-Deacon, within this
Realm, might from thencforth <hi>lawfully execute and exercise
all maner of Iurisdiction, commonly called Ecclesiastical Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and all Censures and Coercions appertaining, or in any
wise belonging unto the same, albeit such person or persons be Lay,
married or unmarried, so that they be Doctors of the Civil Law,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61619:233"/>
lawfully created and made in any Vniversity:</hi> Out of which
premises, if Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> can conclude, that such Lay-men, so
quallified to exercise Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, were the
Kings Officers, and not the Bishops; he must have some new
piece of <hi>Sandersons Logick,</hi> which never was read in any of
the Universities, in which those lay persons did receive the
Degree of Doctors.</p>

and the onely right Issue to the</hi> Crown, <hi>begotten no donbt in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Matrimony.</hi>] I dare not take upon me to dispute of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
to the Crown, but I dare take upon me to tell our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
that there was some doubt made by the most learned
men of that time, whether Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> (of whom he
speaks) were begotten and born in lawful Marriage: All the
Bishops in this Realm, by a publick Writing under their
Hands and Seals, declared the Marriage of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth, with Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Mother, to be unlawful; and so
did the most eminent Divines in both the Universities, as
also in the Cathedrals, Monasteries, and other Conventual
Bodies within this Realm: The like declared also by several
Universities in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> under their publick Seals:
And so it was declared finally by the Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
and the Commons assembled in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> full and free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in which it was pronounced, That the Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Relict
of his <hi>Brother,</hi> was <hi>null</hi> and void: to that it seems there
was some doubting in this case, though our Author makes no
doubt of it at all: Nor is it very certain, neither that Queen
<hi>Mary was the right Heir apparent to her Brother:</hi> For if the
Law of the Crown diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r not from the Law of the Land in
this particular (which I leave unto our learned Lawyers) she
could not be the Heir to her Brother King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth,
as being born of another <hi>Venter,</hi> and consequently his Sister
by the half blood onely. Now as he makes no doubt of
Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Title to the Crown, so he makes the Title of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to be subject unto some dispute, which all
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61619:234"/>
the Estates of the Realm convened in her first Parliament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the way of Recognition, to be past disputing:

without any Accusation brought against him either then or
since.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 430. <hi>And then they adjourned until the twentieth of
<hi>October,</hi> and a standing Committee of the House of Commons,
(consisting of fifty Members) appointed, during the Recess.</hi>]
Of this Committee, Mr. <hi>Iohn Pim</hi> was the principal Man,
without whom, all the rest were Ciphers, of no significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And by him there issued out an Order against Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
extended, and intended also, for taking down the
Rails before the Communion-Table, levelling the ground on
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61619:234"/>
which the said Table stood, and placing the said Table in
the middle of the Church or Chancell. In which it is to be
admired how eagerly this <hi>Order</hi> was pursued by the Church-Wardens
generally in all the Parishes of the Kingdom; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they were told, that the Lords had never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
their consent unto it, and that it would be safest for
them to suspend their proceedings till the Parliament was
again assembled. But so mighty was the name of <hi>Pym,</hi> that
none of them durst refuse Obedience unto his Commands.
Nor did the Lords ever endeavour to retrench this Order,
but suffered their Authority and priviledge to be torn from
them peece-meal by the House of Commons; as formerly in
imposing the Protestation of the third of <hi>May,</hi> so now in
this great Alteration in the face of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 432. <hi>The late Irish Army raised for the Assistance of
the Kings Service against the Scots, was disbanded, and all
their armes brought into Dublin.</hi>] This though our Authour
reckoneth not amongst the grounds and reasons of the Irish
Rebellion, yet was it really one of the chief encouragements
to it. For when the King was prest by the Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the disbanding of that Army, a Suit was made unto
him by the Embassadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he might have leave to
List three or four thousand of them for his Masters Service
in the wars. The like Suit was made also by the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of <hi>France,</hi> and the King readily condescended to their
severall motions, and gave order in it accordingly. But the
Commons never thinking themselves safe, as long as any of
that Army had a sword in his hand, never left importuning
the King (whom they had then brought to the condition of
denying nothing which they asked) till they had made him
eat his word and revoke those <hi>Orders</hi> to his great dishonour;
Which so exasperated that Army consisting of 10000 Foot
and 1500 Horse, that it was no hard matter for those who
had the managing of the Plot to make sure of them. And then considering, that the <hi>Scots</hi> by raising of an Army had
gain'd from the King an Abolition of the <hi>Episcopall</hi> Order,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61619:235"/>
the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of that Church to some Uniformity with this, and
setled their Kirk in such a way as best pleased their own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours:
why might not the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists hope, that by the
help of such an Army ready raised to their hands, or easily
drawn together, though disperst at that present, they might
obtain the like indulgences and grants for their Religion, <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
Religio potuit suadere Malorum,</hi> as true on the one side as
the other.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 443. <hi>The next Morning the Vpper house sent them down
to the House of Commons by the Lord Marshal, Privy Seal,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>the Lords</hi> Goring <hi>and</hi> Wilmot.] Our Authour speaks this of
the first Letter sent from <hi>Ireland,</hi> touching that Rebellion,
but is mistaken in the last man, whom he makes to be sent
down with these Letters. The Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> at that time
was no Peer of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore had no place in the
<hi>English Parliaments.</hi> The honour of an English Baron being
first conferred on his Son the Lord <hi>Henry Wilmot</hi> by Letters
Patents bearing date 29. of <hi>Iune, Anno</hi> 1643. And as I am
sure that the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> was not of that number, so I am
doubtfull whether the Lord <hi>Marshall</hi> were or not. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
not long before tels us, that his Office of Lord High
Steward was like to be begg'd from him in regard of his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
which is to be understood of his absence out of the
Realm; and if he were then absent out of the Realm, he
could not now be present in the House of Peers. Either
not absent then, or not present now, is a thing past questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 462. <hi>The King returns from</hi> Scotland, <hi>magnificently

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>easted by the City of</hi> London.] But while the Citizens at
one end of the Town, were at their <hi>Hosanna,</hi> some of the
Commons at the other end were as busie at their <hi>Crucifige,</hi>
intent on hammering a <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> which they entitled,
<hi>A Remonstrance of the State of the Kingdom,</hi> in which they
ript up all the actions which they had complained of in the
King, and sum'd up all those services which they had done
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61619:235"/>
for the common people. The whole so framed that it served
for a pair of Bellows to blow that fire which afterwards fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
out, and consumed the greatest part of the Kingdom. In
the presenting whereof to the King at his coming from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
though the Lords refused to joyn with them in it, yet
was it presented to the King by some of their Members, an
Order made for the publishing and dispersing of it, and the
Lords brought at last to justifie what they had condemned.
Nor did the Citizens continue long in their good Affections:
For though they gave him <hi>Rost-meat</hi> now, yet they beat him
with the Spit in the <hi>Christmas</hi> following, of which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
tels us, saying,</p>
                  <p>Fol. 471. <hi>The loose people of the City, and the Mechanick
sort of Prentices were encouraged by the Ministers and Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and other Incendiaries in tumultuous manner, to come down
to</hi> Westminster, <hi>and by the way at</hi> Whitehall <hi>to be insolent in
words and actions.</hi>] And insolent they were indeed both in
words and actions, some of them crying out as they past by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that the King was not fit to live, others that the Prince
would govern better; all of them with one voice, that they
would have no Porters lodge between them and the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but would come at him when they pleased, using some other
threatning words, as if they meant to break open the Gates:
But so it happened, that some of the Officers of the Kings
late Army being come to the Court, some of them to receive
the Arrears of their pay, and others to know the Kings
Commands, before they returned into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi>
to their severall Charges, and observing the unsufferable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies
of this Rascal Rabble, sallied upon them with drawn
swords, in which scuffle some of that tumultuous Rabble
were slightly hurt, and others dangerously wounded. To
these men being profest Souldiers, was the Name of <hi>Cavaliers</hi>
first given, communicated afterwards to all the Kings
party and Adheren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

appearing for him then in the Loyalty of their Affections.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 477. <hi>This fell out as many would have it, a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61619:236"/>
to their confusion.</hi>] How so? Because, saith he, at a conference
desired by the Lords with the House of Commons, they were
told by the Lord Keeper, that this Petition and Protestation
of the twelve Bishops was extending to the deep intrenching
upon the fundamentall priviledges and beings of Parliaments,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon which Declaration the Bishops were voted to be
guilty of High Treason, committed first to the custody of the
black rod, and from thence to the Tower. But first the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
is to know, that the Lord Keeper at that time was not
altogether so <hi>rectus in Curia,</hi> as might have been wished,
and therefore having received that Petition and Protestation
from the hands of the King (to whom in the first place it
was addressed) he communicated it privately to such of
both Houses as were like to make the worst use of it; and
the more to ingratiate himself with the prevalent party, he
aggravated the supposed offence to the very utmost; And
the supposed offence was this, that the Bishops having been
frequently reviled, pursued, and violently kept from the
House of Peers, protested by a Writing under their
hands, <q>That they durst not sit or Vote in the House
of Peers, untill his Majesty should secure them from
all affronts, indignities and dangers; and therefore that all
Laws, Orders, Votes, Resolutions, and Determinations
should be reputed null and of none effect, which in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
had passed or should passe in the said most Honourable
House, during the time of their forced and violent absence.</q>
Which Petition and Protestation being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

served their turns by the imprisonment of the Bishops

and accusation under which they suffered. Adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
that when the Members of the House of Commons were
seized upon and kept in custody by the Officers of the Army,
under the command of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> on the sixt and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
daies of <hi>December,</hi> 1647. they made a Protestation to
this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> that all Acts and Ordinances, Votes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the House of Commons made after the said sixt
and seventh of <hi>December,</hi> or after to be made, during their
restraint and forcible seclusion from the House and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance

                     </gap>ntents and purposes whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Which protestation though it toucht the Officers of
the Army to the <hi>very quick,</hi> yet had they so much modesty
as not to count it for high Treason. And when the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
which were left remaining in that House for the present
turn, had scanned over every particular of that protestation,
they only ventured so far as to <hi>Vote it to be scandalous and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious,
as tending to destroy the present visible Government; and
that all that had a hand in it were unworthy of trust;</hi> for
which consult <hi>Mercurius Pragmaticus, Numb.</hi> 38. By which

                        </gap>art and hands with the House
of Commons, summon a Common Councel, where they debate
their jealousies and fears.</hi>] The constitution of the Common
Councell of the City, was of great concernment at this time,
and therefore it behoved the Commons (in order to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61619:237"/>
of their designe) that it should be new moulded,
most of the old ones laid aside, and creatures of their own
elected into their places. And by their Emissaries and Agents,
they prevailed so far, that on S. <hi>Thomas day,</hi> when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Councell-men
were to be chosen for every Ward, in
stead of those grave, sober, and substantiall men, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had, they chose a company of factious and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
persons, known only by their disaffections to Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical
and Episcopal Government. And whereas by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
custome of the City, the Common-Councell-men then
elected were not admitted unto Councell till the Munday af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Twelfthday, when their Elections were returned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled
by the Town-Clerk; these men well knowing how
much the Designe of the Commons did depend upon them,
would not stay so long. And therefore when the King had
appointed a Common-Councell to be called on the last day of
<hi>December</hi> for the prevention of such tumults as had happened
a few daies before, they thrust themselves in amongst the
rest. The like they did, when the King gave a meeting to a
Common Councel, appointed by him on the fifth of <hi>Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
wherein he acquainted them with the reason of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
against the five impeached Members, desiring that
they might not have any retreat or harbour within the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
At what time <hi>Fowke</hi> one of these Common-Councell
men, as being the Bell-weather to the rest, made a sawcy
and insolent speech unto the King, concerning <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,</hi>
touching the Members accused, the <hi>Priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
and that they might not be tried but in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
way. To which, though the King returned a very
milde and gracious Answer, yet the Rabble being once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
by their seditious Orator, would not so be satisfied,
but at his coming out of the Hall, and as he past in his Coach
thorow the Streets, there was nothing ecchoed in his ears
but <hi>Priviledges of Parliament, Priviledges of Parliament.</hi> By
the help and vote of these men also was that Petition framed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and delivered to the King on the morrow after, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61619:237"/>
immediatly in our Authour. And by the help of these
men did they extort the Militia of the City out of the hands
of the Mayor and Aldermen, and put it into the power of
inferiour persons, such as the Faction in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
might best confide in. And for their <hi>Iealousies</hi> and
<hi>Fears</hi> which were to be debated in the Common Councell,
they were of no lesse nature then the blowing up of the
<hi>Thames</hi> to drown the City, or the beating it down about
their ears by Col. <hi>Lunsford</hi> from the Tower, or the sacking
it by the King and the Cavaliers. Horrible Gulleries, but
such as were generally disperst, and no lesse generally belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by fools, women and children.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 482. <hi>Vpon information of Troops of Horse to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by the Lord Digby and Colonell Lunsford at</hi> Kingston,
<hi>where the County Magazine is lodged, they order that the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
of the severall Counties,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall suppresse all unlawfull
Assemblies.</hi> &amp;c.] Most true it is, that such an order was made
by the House of Commons, the better to amaze the people,
and keep them in continuall <hi>Fears and Iealousies</hi> of the Kings
proceedings. But nothing is more false, then that any Troops
of Horse had been rais'd by the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> or Colonel <hi>Luns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
or that they had any such designe as to seize the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
at <hi>Kingston;</hi> which they might easily have done, had
they been so minded, before it could have been prevented.
But the truth is, that the King not knowing what the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
Tumults might amount unto, commanded the Officers of
the late Army before-mentioned, to attend his pleasure, till
he saw some issue of the practices which were held against
him. On which command they followed him to <hi>Hampton
Court, Ianuary the tenth,</hi> 1641. at his Removall from <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
for avoiding such fresh Insolencies, as the people in
their triumphant conducting of the accused Members to the
Houses of Parliament, might have put upon him. These
Officers now known by the Name of Cavaliers, were lodged
at <hi>Kingston,</hi> and upon them the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> accompanied

                  <p>Fol. 485. <hi>And so the breach between the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was stitcht up.</hi>] That is to say, that great breach of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

this breach was not stitcht up now, nor in a long time after.

sticking at it, especially as to the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> or of

him about it, being then at <hi>New-Market</hi> (and not as our
Authour saith at <hi>Royston</hi>) he answered more resolutely then
before, that he would not part with it <hi>for a minute, no, not
unto his Wife and Children.</hi> After which time, finding the
King too well resolved not to part with such a principall

flower of his prerogative, they past an Ordinance for enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuling
themselves unto it, and did accordingly make use of
it in the following war against the King. Nor was the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
any thing the better welcome for the men that brought
it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> both of them

Counsellour, the most intimate in affection, the first of his Bed-chamber,
his constant companion in all his Sports and Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>]
Yet notwithstanding all these favours, this Earl as
much promoted the <hi>Puritan</hi> affairs of the Court, but secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and under-hand, as his Brother the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> more
openly and professedly did in the Countrey. Of which thus

Bridges drawn up, and</hi> Hotham <hi>from the Wals flatly denies him
entrance.</hi>] Of this Affront (<hi>Hotham</hi> being first proclaimed
Traitor under the Wals of the Town) the King complains
to the Houses of Parliament, but he had more reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of some about him. For in his Answer to their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61619:239"/>
about the Magazine of <hi>Hull,</hi> delivered to him in the

was that place (whatsoever discourse there was of private or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

given up, if he should require it:</hi>

he had his Wages not long after: For being suspected to

knockt down on that very place on which he stood when he

                  <p>Fol. 512. <hi>All which</hi> (that is to say, the Kings going to <hi>Hull)
being by the King a high breach of Priviledge, and violation of

breach of priviledge objected was, the Kings endeavor to
possess himself of the Town of <hi>Hull,</hi> (his own Town) and
to get into his hands a Magazine of Arms and Ammunition
which he had bought with his own money: To hinder which,
and to justifie <hi>Hotham,</hi> the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>

by the House of Commons as a standing Committee to reside
at <hi>York:</hi> And had they come thither on no other business
then what was openly pretended, it had been such an extent
of Priviledge (making the House of Commons as wide as the
Kingdom) as never was challenged before: But they were
sent on another errand, that is to say, to be as Spies on all
the Kings Actions, to undermine all his Proceedings, and to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61619:239"/>
insinuate into the people, that all their hopes of Peace and
happiness, depended on their adhering to the present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And they applyed themselves to their instructions,
with such open confidence, that the King had not more meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with the Gentry of that Country, in his Palace called
the Manor House, then they had with the Yeomanry and
Free-holders, in the great Hall of the Deanry: All which,
the King suffered very strangely, and thereby robb'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of the opportunity of raising an Army in that County,
with which he might have marcht to <hi>London,</hi> took the Hen
sitting on her nest before she had hatched, and possibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
all those Calamities which after followed.</p>
                  <p>To omit many less mistakes, as <hi>Sheffield</hi> for <hi>Whitfield, fol.</hi> 306.
and <hi>Kit the Taylor,</hi> for <hi>Ket the Tanner, fol.</hi> 540. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
gives unto Sir <hi>William Neve,</hi> the title of <hi>Garter-Herald,</hi>
which was more then ever the King bestowed upon him; he
having at that time no other title then <hi>Norroy</hi> the third King,
Sir <hi>Iohn Burroughs</hi> being then <hi>Garter-Herald,</hi> and Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
St. George</hi> the second King of Arms, by the name of
<hi>Clarenceux,</hi> to whom Sir <hi>William Neve</hi> succeeded in that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
at such time as he the said Sir <hi>Henry</hi> succeeded Sir <hi>Iohn
Burroughs</hi> (who dyed sometime after this at <hi>Oxford</hi>) in the
place of <hi>Garter:</hi> But we must now return to matters of
greater consequence; and first, we encounter with the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>Edge-Hill,</hi> of which our Author tells us, That</p>
                  <p>Fol. 586. <hi>The question will be who had the better.</hi>] But the
Parliament put it out of question, by sending the Earl of
<hi>Pembroke,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Wharton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Strode,</hi> on the 27 of <hi>October,</hi> to declare
to the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Citizens, the greatness
and certainty of their Victory, how God had own'd his own
work, their Speeches being eight in all, harping upon this
String, That as the Cause had been <hi>undertaken with their
Purses and with their Persons,</hi> so they would crown the work,
by following it with the same <hi>zeal, love, care, nobleness, and
Alacrity:</hi> And the better to keep up the Hearts of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61619:240"/>
the Commons voted to their General a present of 5000 <hi>l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
which he kindely accepted, to the no small commendation
of his modesty, in taking so small a reward for so great a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
or of their Bounty, in giving him so great a sum for
being vanquished: And yet this was not all the Honor which
they did him neither, a Declaration being past by both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Parliament, on the 11 of <hi>November</hi> then next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Concerning the late valorous and acceptable Service of his
Excellency</hi> Robert <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex, to remain upon Record in
both Houses, for a mark of Honor to his Person, Name, and
Family, and for a Monument of his singular vertue to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi>
In which they seem to imitate the <hi>Roman Senate,</hi> in
the magnificent reception which they gave to <hi>Terentius Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>
after his great defeat in the Battle of <hi>Cannae,</hi> the People
being commanded to go forth to meet him, and the <hi>Senate</hi>
giving him publick thanks, <hi>Quod de salute Reipub. non despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasset,</hi>
because he despaired not of the safety of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:
Which whether it were an Argument of their
Gallantry, as <hi>Livy</hi> telleth us, or rather of their fear, as Sir
<hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> is of opinion, I dispute not now? Certain I
am, that by this Artifice they preserved their Reputation with
the People of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which otherwise might
have been apt to mutiny, and set open their Gates to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
And to say the truth, the care of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>
deserv'd all this, though his Fortune did not: For having
lost the Battle, he hasted by speedy marches thither, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that City and the Parliament, which otherwise would
not have been able to preserve themselves.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary, our Author lays down many solid
and judicious Arguments, to prove that the King had the
better of it, as no doubt he had: And for a further proof
hereof, we cannot have a better evidence then an Order of
the Lords and Commons, issued on the 24 of <hi>October,</hi> being
the next day after the Fight, in which all the Citizens of
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster, &amp;c.</hi> were commanded to shut up
their Shops, and put themselves into a readiness to defend the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61619:240"/>
City and the Parliament: Which Order they had never
made, if their fear of the Kings suddain coming upon them
with his Conquering Army, before their broken Forces could
reach thither, had not put them to it: And though the King
might have come sooner then he did, the taking in of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
Oxford</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> (being all possessed in the name
of the Parliament) spending much of his time; yet we finde
him on the 12 of day <hi>November,</hi> beating up their Quarters
at <hi>Brentford,</hi> where they had lodged two of their best Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to stop him in his march towards <hi>London;</hi> some other
of their Forces being placed at <hi>Kingston, Acton,</hi> and other
Villages adjoyning: In the success of which Fight, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
tells us, That</p>
                  <p>Fol. 594. <hi>The King took 500 Prisoners, &amp;c. and so unfought
with, marched away to</hi> Oatlands, Reading, <hi>and so to</hi> Oxford.]</p>
                  <p>By this we are given to understand, that the King retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
toward <hi>Oxford,</hi> but we are not told the reasons of it, it
being improbable that he should march so far as <hi>Brentford,</hi> in
his way towards <hi>Lond.</hi> without some thoughts of going fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Accordingly it was so resolv'd, (if my intelligence and
memory do not fail me) &amp; order given for the advancing of
the Army on the morning after, which being ready to be put
in Execution, News came, that at a place called <hi>Turnham-Green,</hi>
not far from <hi>Brentford,</hi> both the Remainders of the
Army under the command of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries
of <hi>London,</hi> under the conduct of the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
were in readiness to stop his march: And thereupon it was
consulted, whether the King should give the charge, or that
it might be thought enough in point of Honor, to have gone
so far.</p>
                  <p>On the one side it was alledged, that his Army was in good
heart, by reason of their good success the day before, that
the Parliament Forces consisted for the most part of raw and
unexperienced Souldiers, who had never seen a War before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that if this bar were once put by, his way would be open
unto <hi>London,</hi> without any resistance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:61619:241"/>On the other side it was Objected, That the King had no
other Army then this, that there was nothing more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
then the fortune of a Battle, and that if this Army were
once broken, it would be impossible for him to raise another;
which last consideration turn'd the Scale, that Counsel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thought most fit to be followed, which was judged
most safe, <hi>id gloriosius quod tutissimum,</hi> said the old Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</p>
                  <p>And as for the five hundred Prisoners which our Authour
speaks of, they were first mov'd to enter into the Kings pay,
and that being generally refused, they were dismist with life
and liberty, having first taken their Corporal Oaths not to
serve against him: But the Houses of Parliament, being loth
to lose so many good men, appointed Mr. <hi>Stephen Marshal</hi> to
call them together, and to absolve them from that Oath;
which he did with so much confidence and Authority, that
the Pope himself could not have done it better: The King
was scarce setled in <hi>Oxford,</hi> the fittest place for his Court and
Counsel to reside in, When</p>
                  <p>Fol. 597. <hi>The noble Lord Aubigny, Brother to the Duke of</hi>
Richmond, <hi>dyed, and was buried at</hi> Oxford.] This Lord <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigny,</hi>
was the second Son of <hi>Esme</hi> Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and
Earl of <hi>March,</hi> succeeding his Father both in that Title and
Estate, entail'd originally on the second Son of the House
of <hi>Lenox:</hi> he receiv'd his deaths wound at <hi>Edge-Hill,</hi> but
dyed, and was solemnly interr'd at <hi>Oxford,</hi> on the 13 of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi>
then next following; the first, but not the last of that
Illustrious Family, which lost his life in his Kings Service.
For after this, in the year 1644. the Lord <hi>Iohn Stewart</hi> lost
his life in the Battle of <hi>Cheriton,</hi> near <hi>Alresford</hi> in the county
of <hi>South-Hampton:</hi> And in the year 1645. the Lord <hi>Bernard

our Beds, and to leave the Village, (at least the Women) one of

upon us; the Bullets flew for the most part over our head<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fol. 603. <hi>The next day the Prince marches to</hi> Glocester,
<hi>his hasty Summons startled them at these strange turnings.</hi>]
So saies our <hi>Authour,</hi> but he hath no Authour for what he
saith. The Prince marched not the next day to <hi>Glocester,</hi>
nor in many moneths after, having businesse enough to do at
<hi>Cirencester</hi> where he was; upon the taking of which Town,
the Souldiers Garrison'd for the Parliament in the Castles of
<hi>Barkly, Sudely,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> deserted those
places, which presently the Prince possessed and made good
for the King: Which done, he called before them all the
Gentry of <hi>Cotswold,</hi> and such as lived upon the banks of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi>
betwixt <hi>Glocester</hi> and <hi>Bristol;</hi> who being now freed
from those Garisons which before had awed them, were easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded by him to raise a Monethly contribution of
4000. pound toward the defence of the Kings person, their
Laws and Liberties. It was indeed generally beleeved, that
if he had marched immediatly to <hi>Glocester,</hi> while the terrour
of sacking <hi>Cirencester</hi> fell first upon them, the Souldiers there
would have quitted the place before he had come half way
unto it. the affrightment was so generall, and their haste
so great, that <hi>Massey</hi> had much adoe to perswade the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to keep their Houses, and the Souldiers to stand upon
their Guard (as I have often heard from some of good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in that City) till the Scouts which he sent out to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

the Motions of the Prince were returned again: But
whatsoever they feared at <hi>Glocester,</hi> the Prince had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

unfurnisht of Canon and other necessaries for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
of a place of such a large circumference, so well
mann'd and populous as that City was; Contented therefore
with that honour which he had got in the gaining of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencester,</hi>
and feeling the Kings affairs in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
he thought it a point of higher wisedom to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

It was conceived, and by some reported, that if
the King had shewed good countenance to these three Lords,
most of the rest would have left the Parliament, and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him. But the King considered well enough, that
not so much the sense of their duty, as his successes in the
West, had brought them thither; and that if five or six only
of the Lords should be left in <hi>Westminster,</hi> those five or six
only would be thought sufficient to constitute a House<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of

design was not to be discommended. But on the contrary, it

themselves into a body under the command of Sir <hi>Michael

and 700 Carriages; and it appears by the number of
Arms delivered up by Composition, amounting to 8000 in
all, that his Foot could not consist of less then ten or twelve
thousand: And for his Horse, no fewer then 2500 made a
clear escape<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that he might have kept the Field, and put
the King to it in a Battle, if there had not been somewhat
more in it then our Author speaks of. It was therefore thought
by some knowing men which understood the state of Affairs,
that knowing his Horse were gone off without any danger,
and that his Foot might save themselves by a Composition,
he was willing to keep the Seas even as before was intimated:
For partly being discourag'd from pursuing the War by his
first success at Edge-Hill, and partly coming to know more of
the Intentions of such as managed the design, then had been

which ground, as he had neglected the opportunity of march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
directly towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> when he had removed the Kings
Forces out of <hi>Reading;</hi> so on the defeat of <hi>Waller</hi> at <hi>Lands-Down,</hi>
he writ unto the Houses to send Petitions to the King
for Peace, as appears by this History, <hi>fol.</hi> 625. For which
coldness of his, so plainly manifested, it was not onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by <hi>Vassal</hi> in the House of Commons, that he should lay
down his Command, but many jeers were put upon him, and
some infamous Pictures made of him to his great dishonor:
Considering therefore, that on the defeat of Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> at
<hi>Marston-Moor,</hi> all the North parts were like to be regain'd
to the Houses of Parliament; he was willing to let the King
remain as absolute in the West, as they were like to be in the
North, which since he could not do with Honor, by heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Kings fair proffer, seconded by a Letter from all
the chief Officers of his Army, he cast himself into such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
as might give him some colour to shift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and leave his Foot to some Agreement with the King:
No way but this, (as he conceiv'd) to bring the leading Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of both Houses unto such a Temper, as might induce
them to meet the King half way in the Road to peace; and if
this could not do it, the coming on of Winter might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
cool them into some conditions which the King might
be as willing to hearken to as they to offer. This I remember
to be the summe of such Discourses as were made at that time
in and about the Court, by men of the best knowledge and
understanding in the state of businesses; but whether they
hit upon the right string or not, I am not able to affirm. This

so long at <hi>Daventry,</hi> was not the way to raise that siege.
Nor was the Town in any such danger (but that the Ladies

from the pursuit of his Successes; and thereby to give time

one of his Thanks-giving Sermons hath informed me in it.
Upon the reading of this Letter, it was concluded to fall on
with the first opportunity, before these new supplies should
be added to the rest of the Kings Forces. And it was as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
in the Consequents as it had been in the Antecedents;
neither the King no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

In the loss of his Coaches there was no great matter,
nor so much in the loss of his Cabinet of Letters and Papers,
as his Enemies did conceive it was: A Cabinet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which
were many Letters and Paper, most of them written to the
Queen; but they, together with the rest, publisht in Print
by Order of the Houses of Parliament. The Design was to
render the King odious in the sight of the People, by giving
license to the Queen to promise some favors for the Catholick
party here in <hi>England,</hi> if she could obtain any succour for
him from the Catholicks there: But they lost more by it
then they got.</p>
                  <p>For first, They drew a general obloquy on themselves, by
publishing the secret passages betwixt Man and Wife, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61619:255"/>
to the rules of Humanity and common honesty.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, They gave the People such a representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Kings Abilities, his Piety, Prudence, and deep
foresight into Affairs, as rais'd him to an high degree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation
with all sorts of men; as Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in printing the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viat
of his Life,</hi> though intended otherwise. An errour
which the Houses were soon sensible of, and thereupon gave
Order that in the publishing of the great Volume of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> by <hi>Edward Husbands,</hi> in which were many passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

should be left out; though the Letters in the Lord <hi>Digbies</hi>
Cabinet which was taken at <hi>Sherburn</hi> were printed there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest. So wise are men upon the <hi>post fact,</hi> when it is
too late.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 826. <hi>But the same night at the very noise of the Kings
coming from</hi> Worcester, <hi>they prepared for flight, and the next
morning not a Scot to be seen, felt, or heard of; they were all fled.</hi>]
The <hi>Scots</hi> had lain before <hi>Hereford</hi> from the 30. of <hi>Iuly</hi> to
the first of <hi>September,</hi> and had so well entrencht themselves
that there was no fear of being beaten up by the King, who
since the fatall blow at <hi>Naseby</hi> had never been the Master of
such Forces as to give Battell to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and much lesse to
assault them in their Trenches. So that the noise of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Kings Forces from <hi>Worcester,</hi> might be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
but it could not be the reall cause of his hasty raising
of the Siege. <hi>Lesly</hi> (unworthily made Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> at the

And now there comes the lamentable News of the taking of

affirmed expresly (being desired to shew the truth in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular)
that there were about 80. Women in it at that time
when the House was stormed. So that our Authour in this
point was extremely out, as much as the difference can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to between a Company of 80. and one single person.
The words to be explained are these, <hi>viz. a Godly Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,
for protection mixt with some Popish Priests Profession;</hi>
Which words have neither sense nor Grammar, as they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, and therefore must be taught to speak English be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ordinary Reader can understand them. And if the
words were put into proper and Grammaticall English, we
must reade them thus, <hi>viz. A Godly Protestant Divine mixt
for protection with some Priests of the Popish profession.</hi> Which
being the Grammar of the words, will give a Logical dispute
about the party to whom the Character is given. I think
our Authour would not have it understood of D. <hi>Griffiths</hi>
Daughter (who though a very vertuous and godly Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman)
cannot be called a Godly Protestant Divine, in the
common notion of the phrase; and yet the current of the
words does import no lesse. For it is said, that there was but
one woman amongst so many men: D <hi>Griffiths Daughter a
Godly Protestant Divine,</hi> &amp;c. Nor can it properly be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of D. <hi>Griffith,</hi> though a Godly Protestant Divine, the
following words depending on those before D. <hi>Griffiths</hi>
Daughter, and not relating literally and grammatically to
the Doctor himself. Had the tenour of the words run thus,
<hi>The Daughter of</hi> D. <hi>Griffith a Godly Protestant Divine, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct

And so he was at this time also, when he was discomfited

was not able to act any thing in it, as neither could M. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary

                  <p>Fol. 871. <hi>And the West being cleared <hi>Fairfax</hi> returns back
again to the Siege of</hi> Bristol.] The west so far from being
clear'd, that except <hi>Bridgewater</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> and <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi>-
Castle in <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi> little or nothing was done in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to it. The Counties of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwall</hi> still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
untoucht, in which the Prince had not only a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Army under brave Commanders, but many strong
Towns and Garisons well stored with Souldiers; so as at this
siege of <hi>Bristol</hi> it was conceived that two great Errors were
committed, the first by <hi>Fairfax</hi> in sitting down before a
Town in which were so many able men well armed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the General of his Majesties Forces; and leaving
an Army at his back, which might have charged him in the
Rear, while those within sallied out upon him, and assailed
him in the very front.</p>
                  <p>The second Errour was in <hi>Rupe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t,</hi> in that being Generall
of the Kings Forces, he shut himself up within a Town, when
it had been more proper for him to have been abroad, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together the Kings old Souldiers, and raising new
from severall places, by which he might have put himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Condition to raise the Siege. But <hi>Fairfax</hi> knew well
what he did, making no doubt to have the Town delivered
to him before the Prince could be inform'd of the danger in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61619:258"/>
which it was. For the delivery of which City so strongly
fortified, so well mann'd, so furnisht with all sorts of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
provisions, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> incurr'd the suspicion of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty
both with the King and all his party. He had before
sent certain Letters to the King, in which he pressed him
(somewhat beyond good manners) to come to a speedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
with his Parliament, without relating either to point
of honour or conscience; with which the King seemed more
displeased as appeareth by his answer to him, <hi>fol.</hi> 841. then
was agreeable unto his ordinary temper. And so much was
the King startled when he heard of the giving up of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the Fort and Castle, and that too in so short a time,
that he posted away a Messenger to the Lords at <hi>Oxford</hi> to
displace <hi>Col. Legg</hi> (a well known Creature of Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi>)
from the Government of that City and Garison, and to put
it into the hands of Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham;</hi> which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
done, and done unto the great contentment of all the
Kings party, except that Prince and his Dependents. But
<hi>Legg</hi> was sweetned not long after by being made one of the
Grooms of his Majesties Bed-chamber, a place of less com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
but of greater trust.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 891. <hi>And now the Parliament consider of a Term or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be given to the Commissioners intrusted with their Great
Seal, and are to be called Conservators of the Common-wealth
of</hi> England.] Not so, with reference either to the time or
the thing it self.</p>
                  <p>For first, The Commissioners of the Great Seal were
never called the Conservators fo the Common-wealth of
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Secondly, If they ever had been called so, it was
not now, that is to say, when the Kings Seals were broken
in the House of Peers, which was not long after Midsummer,
in the year 1646. But the truth is, that on the 30 of <hi>Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
1648. being the day of the Kings most deplorable death,
the Commons caused an Act or Order to be printed, in
which it was declared that from thenceforth in stead of the

who these Keepers of the Liberties were, was a thing much
questioned, some thought the Commissioners for the great
Seal were intended by it, whom our Authour by a mistake
of the Title cals here the <hi>Conservators of the Common-wealth;</hi>
others conceiv'd that it related to the Councel of State,
but neither rightly: For the truth is, that there were never
any such men to whom this Title was appliable in one

as they could. At last they came to this Agreement, that
for the sum of Two hundred thousand pounds, they should
deliver him to such Commissioners as the Houses should Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
to receive him of them, which was done according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For</p>
                  <p>Fol. 939. <hi>The Commissioners for receiving the Person of the
King, came to Newcastle, Iune 22. &amp;c.</hi>] Not on the 22 of
<hi>Iune,</hi> I am sure of that, the Commodity to be bought and
sold was of greater value, and the Scots too cunning to part
with it, till they had raised the price of it as high as they
could: The driving of this Bargain took up all the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Kings being carried to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and the middle
of the Winter then next following, so that the King might
be delivered to these Commissioners (that is to say, from Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to Prison) on the 22 day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> but of <hi>Iune</hi> he
could not.</p>
                  <p>And here it will not be amiss to consider what loss or benefit
redounded to those Merchants which traded in the buying and
selling of this precious Commodity.</p>
                  <p>And first, The Scots not long before their breaking out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their King, had in the Court two Lords High Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
and two Grooms of the Stool successively one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
And at their taking up of Arms, they had a Master
of the Horse, a Captain of the Guard, a Keeper of the
privy Purse, seven Grooms of eight, in his Majesties Bed-Chamber,
and an equal number, at the least, of Gentlemen
Ushers, Quarter-Waiters, Cup-Bearers, Carvers, Sewers,
and other Officers attending daily at the Table: I speak not
here of those which had places in the Stables, or below the
Stairs; or of the Servants of those Lords and Gentlemen,
which either lived about the Court, or had Offices in it: All
which together, made up so considerable a number, that the
Court might well be called an Academy of the <hi>Scots</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in which so many of all sorts had their <hi>Breeding,</hi> Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and Preferment: Abroad they had a Lieutenant of
the Tower, a Fortress of the most consequence in all the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61619:260"/>
Kingdom; and a Master-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>unner of the Navy, an Office of
as great a trust as the other; and more of those Monopolies,
Suits, and Patents, which were conceiv'd to be most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to the Subject, then all the English of the Court. In
the Church they had two Deanries, divers Prebendaries, and
so many Excclesiastical Benefices, as equalled all the Revenue
of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland:</hi> All which they lost, like <hi>Aesops</hi>
Dog catching after a shadow: For what else were those em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
hopes of ingrossing to themselves all the Bishops Lands,
and participating equally with both Houses in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Kingdom (which drew them into <hi>England</hi> the
second time) but an airy shadow? And yet by catching at
that shadow, they lost all those Advantages which before
they had, both in Court and Countrey; and that not onely
for the present, but in all probability for the times to come.
The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> laid their Heads and Hands together to
embroil the Realm, out of a confidence, that having aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the greatest part of the Tribes from the House of <hi>David,</hi>
they might advance the golden Calves fo their <hi>Presbyteries</hi> in
<hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> and all other places whatsoever within this
Land: And for the maintenance thereof, they had devoured
in conceit all Chapter Lands, and parcelled them amongst
themselves into Augmentations: But no sooner had they
driven this Bargain, but a Vote passed for selling those Lands,
towards the payment of the Debts of the Commonwealth.
Nor have they lived to see their dear Presbytery setled, or
their Lay-Elders entertained in any one Parish of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
for the advancement whereof, the Scots were first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to begin at home, and afterwards to pursue their
work by invading <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others there were who labored for nothng more then the
raising of a New <hi>Commonwealth</hi> out of the Ruins of the old
<hi>Monarchy,</hi> which Plot had been a carrying on from the first
coming of this King to the Crown, till they had gotten him
into their hands; these being like the Husbandmen in Saint
<hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel, who <hi>said among themselves, this is the Heir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

21. 38. A Commonwealth which they had so modelled in
their Brains, that neither Sir <hi>Thomas Moors Vtopia,</hi> nor the
Lord <hi>Verulams</hi> new <hi>Atlantis,</hi> nor <hi>Plato's Platform,</hi> nor any
of the old <hi>Idaeas,</hi> were equal to it; the Honors and Offices
whereof they had distributed amongst themselves, and their
own Dependents: And in pursuance of this project, they
had no sooner brought the King to the end they aimed at, but
they pass an Act, (for so they called it) <hi>prohibiting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
of any Person to be King of England, &amp;c.</hi> That done,
they passed another for the <hi>abolishing the Kingly Office in</hi>
England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> dated the 17 of <hi>March,</hi> One thousand six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
forty eight. A third, <hi>for declaring and a constituting
the People of</hi> England <hi>to be a Commonwealth and Free State,</hi>
dated <hi>May</hi> 19. 1649 which last they solemnly proclaimed
by their <hi>Heralds and Serjeants,</hi> in the most frequented parts
of <hi>London,</hi> and made themselves a new Great Seal, with
the Arms and Impress of their new Commonwealth ingraven
on it. And yet these men that had the purse of all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
at command, and Armies raised for defence of their
Authority, within the space of six years were turned out of
all: And this was done so easily, and with so little noise,
that the loss of that exorbitant Power did not cost so much as
<hi>a broken Head,</hi> or <hi>a Bloody Nose,</hi> in purchasing whereof,
they had wasted so many Millions of Treasure, and more
then an Hundred thousand Lives: So that all reckonings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cast up, it will appear, that all were losers by the Bargain,
as it happens commonly to such men as love to traffick in the
buying and selling of prohibited Commodities, and thereby
make themselves obnoxious to all such forfeitures, as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of the Laws, and the King Displeasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall impose
upon them.</p>

and from thence by a party of Horse to the Head-Quarters
of the Army, our Author hath inform'd us in the
course of this History<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But being there, he tells us, that

he was permitted to give a meeting to his Children.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 995. <hi>And accordingly they met at</hi> Maidstone, <hi>where
they dined together. Well boul'd Vincent!</hi> as our Authour
knows who says in another place: He gives us the Copy
of a Letter in the very same <hi>fol.</hi> from the King to the Duke
of <hi>York,</hi> dated at <hi>Casam, Iuly</hi> 4. 1647. in which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
his <hi>hope that the Duke might be permitted with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Sister, to come to some place betwixt that and</hi> London,
<hi>where he might see them; adding withal, that rather then h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

might not see them, he would be content they should come to
some convenient place to dine, and go back at night:</hi> So then, the
place for this joyful meeting must be some convenient
Town or other betwixt <hi>Casam</hi> and <hi>London:</hi> But <hi>Casam</hi> is a
Village of <hi>Berkshire,</hi> distant about thirty Miles from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>

<hi>Kent,</hi> is distant about thirty Miles from <hi>London,</hi> towards the
East; so that <hi>London</hi> may be truly said to be in the middle
betwixt <hi>Maidstone</hi> and <hi>Casam,</hi> but <hi>Maidstone</hi> by no means
to be in any position betwixt <hi>Casam</hi> and <hi>London:</hi> Perhaps
our Author in this place mistakes <hi>Maidstone</hi> for <hi>Madenhith,</hi>
from <hi>Reading</hi> ten, and from <hi>London</hi> two and twenty miles
distant, and then he may do well to mend it in his second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>And then he may correct also another passage about Judge
<hi>Ienkins,</hi> whom <hi>fol.</hi> 836. he makes to be taken Prisoner in
the City of <hi>Hereford;</hi> and <hi>fol.</hi> 976. at Castle in

hired another Army, compounded of the like <hi>Scythick</hi>
Nations, which in those days passed under the common
name of the <hi>Chasnari,</hi> and it was very wisely done: For
by that means he did not onely waste those <hi>Barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
(all of them being his very bad <hi>Neighbors</hi>) in warring one
against another, but reserved his own Subjects for some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occasions: And as it was done wisely, so was it done as
lawfully also, there being no Law of God or Man which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits
Princes, when they are either invaded by a foreign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
or overlaid by their own Subjects, to have recourse
to such helps as are nearest to them, or most like to give them
their Assistance. Which point our Author prosecutes to a
very good purpose, though he mistake himselfe in the instance
before laid down.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Irish</hi> were then upon the point of calling the <hi>French</hi>

with half the charge, (but with more security) then the bare
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61619:262"/>
ostentation of bringing an English Army to the Borders of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> did amount unto: Which as he might have done
with less charges, so I am sure he might have done it with
far more security: The <hi>Danes</hi> being <hi>Lutherans,</hi> fear nothing
more then the grouth of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> party, and therefore
would have fought with the greater Zeal and the fiercer
Courage, on the very merit of the cause; And having no
confederacies or correspondencies with the <hi>Scots,</hi> in order to
Liberty or Religion, as the <hi>Scots</hi> had with too many of the
people of <hi>England,</hi> the King might have relied upon them
with a greater confidence, then he could do on a mixt Body
of his own, in which the <hi>Puritan</hi> party being more pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
might have distempered all the rest: Such aids were
offered him by his Uncle of <hi>Denmark,</hi> when the two Houses
had first armed his people against him: But he refused them
then for fear of justifying a Calumny which cunningly had
been cast upon him, of admitting Foreign Nations into the
Kingdom, to suppress the Liberties of the people, and to
change their Laws: Afterwards when he sought for them,
then the could not have them, the Houses no less cunning,
hiring the <hi>Swedes</hi> to pick a Quarrel with the <hi>Danes,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to divert that King from giving assistance to his Nephew
in his greatest needs. But the consideration of this mistake

fifths. Incorporated he might be at <hi>Oxford</hi> (as the custome
is) but not then made or created Doctor, as our Authour
would have it. That which comes next touching the eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of many of the <hi>Commons of Christ-Church</hi> gives us two
mistakes; whereof I conceive the one to be the Printers, and
the other our Authors. The mistake of the Printer is the
putting down of the <hi>Common</hi> of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> for the (<hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi>
of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> unlesse perhaps the meaning be that
the old Canons were put out of <hi>Commons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that the new ones
might have the fuller Diet when they came into their places.
The mistake of our Authour is in saying that <hi>many of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of Christ-Church were ejected,</hi> whereas they were all of
them ejected, not a man excepted; the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so impartiall in the executing of his Office, that he would
not spare D. <hi>Hammond</hi> though he were his God-son. And
though D. <hi>Iohn Wall,</hi> partly by the mediation of Friends, but
chiefly by his humble submission to the power of the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
was again admitted into the number of the Canons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet
was he ejected with the rest, and came not into his own place
at this new admission, but into the place of some of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Canons, to shew that he stood not on his old Right but
this new Admission. The Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> having done the
businesse which he came about, returns to the Parliament, was
first thanked for his <hi>wonderful wisedom,</hi> and then they Vote,</p>
                  <p>

to submit to the power, should be expelled the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</hi>]
According to which Vote, a generall purge was given
to all the Colleges in the same, working upon them more
or lesse, as they found the humours more or lesse Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant;
on none so strongly as on <hi>Christ-Church</hi> and

And yet the storm fell not so heavy on those at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as
the Earl of <hi>Manchesters</hi> Visitation had done at <hi>Cambridge;</hi>
For he not only cut off the heads, and skinned the Fellows
and Scholars of most Colledges, but in <hi>Queens</hi> Colledge

to it had been designed to an <hi>Escheat,</hi> as a forfeited and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved

Kings Service, that whilest he is a Prisoner, takes upon him
the Kings Cause, and published an Answer such as it is, which
we submit to censure.</hi>] And being submitted unto Censure, I
conceive it deserves not such a diminution or disparagement,
as to call it <hi>an Answer such as it is.</hi> The Answer I never saw
before, and cannot now possibly conjecture at the Authour
of it. But upon the best judgement which I am able to make,
I conceive it to be so full, so punctuall and satisfactory, that
our Authour, calling all the Doctors of his own making to
his assistance is not able to mend it.</p>

to remove the King out of that Castle to a place of

not consent for losing the allowance of the House. His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for this attempt was that the King was in too publike

&amp;c.] In the recital of which names, we finde two <hi>Earls,</hi>
that is to say, the Earls of <hi>Brentford</hi> and <hi>Ruthen,</hi> which are
not to be found in any Records amongst our Heralds in either
Kingdom: Had he said General <hi>Ruthen</hi> Earl of <hi>Brentford,</hi>
he had hit it right. And that both he and his Reader also
may the better understand the Risings and Honors of this
Man, I shall sum them thus: Having served some time in the
Wars of <hi>Gustavus Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> he was Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him in his Camp before <hi>Darsaw,</hi> a Town of <hi>Pomerella,</hi>
(commonly counted part of <hi>Prussia</hi>) and belonging to the
King of <hi>Poland, Anno</hi> 1627. at what time the said King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Order of the <hi>Garter,</hi> with which he was invested
by Mr. <hi>Peter Yong,</hi> one of his Majesties Gentlemen Huishers,
and Mr. <hi>Henry St. George,</hi> one of the Heralds at Arms,
whom he also Kinghted. In the long course of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Wars, this Colonel Sir <hi>Patrick Ruthen,</hi> obtain'd such
a Command as gave him the title of a <hi>General,</hi> and by that
title he attended in a gallant Equipage on the Earl of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
then riding in great pomp towards <hi>Windsor,</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled
Knight of the <hi>Garter.</hi> At the first breaking out of the
<hi>Scots</hi> Rebellion, he was made a Baron of that Kingdom, and
Governor of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which he defended
very bravely, till the Springs which fed his Well were broken
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61619:267"/>
and diverted by continual Batteries. Not long ater he was
made Earl of <hi>Forth,</hi> and on the death of the Earl of <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi>
was made Lord General of his Majesties Army; and
finally, created Earl of <hi>Brentford</hi> by Letters Patents, dated
the 27 of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1644. with reference to the good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which he had done in that Town for the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st hanselling
of his Office: So then we have an Earl of <hi>Brentford,</hi> but
no Earl of <hi>Ruthen,</hi> either as joyn'd in the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or distinct in two: Not much unlike is that which
follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibid. His Commissions to his Commanders were thus stiled,</hi>
Charls <hi>Prince of great Britain, Duke of</hi> Cornwal <hi>and</hi> Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.]
Here have we two distinct Titles conferred upon one
Person, in which I do very much suspect our Authors Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence:
For though the Prince might Legally stile himself
Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> yet I cannot easily believe that he took
upon himself the Title of Duke of <hi>Albany.</hi> He was Duke of
<hi>Cornwal</hi> from his Birth, as all the eldest Sons of the Kings
of <hi>England</hi> have also been since the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the third, who on the death of his Uncle, <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Eltham,</hi>
E. of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> invested his eldest Son <hi>Edw.</hi> the Black Prince
into the Dukedom of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> by a <hi>Coronet on his head, a ring
on his finger, and a silver Verge in his hand: Since which time,</hi> (as
our learned <hi>Camden</hi> hath observed) <hi>the King of</hi> Englands <hi>eldest
Son is reputed Duke of</hi> Cornwal <hi>by Birth, and by vertue of
a special Act, the first day of his Nativity is presumed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to be of full<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perfect age, so that on that day he may sue
for his Livery of the said Dukedom, and ought by right to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the same, as well as if he had been one and twenty years old:
And he hath his Royalties in certain Actions, and Stannery
Matters, in Wracks at Sea, Customs, &amp;c. yea, and Divers
Officers or Ministers assigned unto him for these or such like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi>
And as for the Title of Duke of <hi>albany,</hi> King <hi>Charls,</hi>
as the second Son of <hi>Scotland,</hi> receiv'd it from King <hi>Iames</hi>
his Father, and therefore was not like to give it from his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son;
the eldest Son of <hi>Scotland</hi> being Duke of <hi>Roth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:61619:268"/>
from his Birth, but none of them Dukes of <hi>Albany,</hi> (for
ought ever I could understand) either by Birth or by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 1094. <hi>And so the dignity of Arch-Bishops to fall, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
Iurisdiction also.]</hi> Our Author concludes this, from
the general words of the Kings Answer, related to in the
words foregoing; <hi>viz. That whatsoever in Episcopacy did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
not to have clearly proceeded from Divine Institution, he
gives way to be totally abolished.</hi> But granting that the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Arch-Bishops was to fall by this Concession, yet the
same cannot be affirmed of the <hi>Episcopal Iurisdiction,</hi> which
hath as good Authority in the holy Scripture as the calling
it self: For it appears by holy Scripture, that unto <hi>Timothy</hi>
the first Bishop of <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sus,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> committed the power
of Ordination, where he requires him <hi>to lay hands hastily on
no man, 1 Tim.</hi> 5 22 And unto <hi>Titus</hi> the first Bishop of <hi>Crete,</hi>
the like Authority for ordaining <hi>Presbyters</hi> (or <hi>Elders,</hi> as
our <hi>English</hi> reads it) <hi>in every City, Tit. 1. v.</hi> 5. Next he
commands them to take care for the ordering of Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Service, <hi>viz. That Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions,
and giving of Thanks be made for all men, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 1. which
words relate not to the private Devotions of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but to the <hi>Divine Service</hi> of the Church, as it is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not onely by St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Chrysostom, Theophylact,</hi> and <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cumenius,</hi>
amongst the Ancients, and by <hi>Estius</hi> for the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi>
but also by <hi>Calvin</hi> for the <hi>Protestant</hi> or Reformed Churches.
Next, he requires them to take care, that such as painfully
labor in the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> receive the honor or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
which is due unto them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. as also to
censure and put to silence all such <hi>Presbyters</hi> as preached any
strange Doctrine, contrary unto that which they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Apostles, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1. 3. And if that failed of the
effect, and that from Preaching <hi>Heterodoxies,</hi> or <hi>strange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi>
they went on to <hi>Heresies,</hi> then to proceed to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
and from thence (if no amendment followed) to
a rejection from his place, and deprivation from his Function,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61619:268"/>
1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. as both the Fathers and late Writers understand
the Text. Finally, for correction in point of Manners, as
well in the Presbyter as the people, St. <hi>Paul</hi> commits it
wholly to the care of his Bishop; where he adviseth <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
not to receive an Accus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ation against a Presbyter</hi> (or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Gospel) <hi>but before two or three Witnesses:</hi> but
if they be convicted, <hi>then to rebuke them before all that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
also may fear,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 19, 20. And on the other side,
he invests him with the like Authority upon those of the <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
of what age or sex soever they were; old men to be
handled gently, not openly to <hi>be rebuked,</hi> but <hi>entreated as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
1 Tim. 5. 1. the like fair usage to be had towards the
<hi>Elder Women,</hi> also v. 2. The <hi>younger men and Women</hi> to be
dealt withall more freely, but as <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Sisters,</hi> v. 1, 2.
A more ample jurisdiction then this, as the Bishops of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
did neither exercise nor challenge, so for all this they
had Authority in holy Scripture; those points of jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
not being given to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> only, but to all
Bishops in their persons, as generally is agreed by the ancient
Writers.</p>
                  <p>So then <hi>Episcopall Iurisdiction</hi> fell not by this concession,
though somewhat more might fall by it then his Majesty
meant. That the Dignity of Archbishops was to fall by it,
is confest on all sides; and that the King made the like <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi>
for the abolishing of <hi>Deans and Chapters</hi> (though not
here mentioned by our Authour) is acknowledged also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
thereupon it must needs follow (which I marvell the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Lawyers then about the King did not apprehend) that the
Episcopal Function was to die with the Bishops which were
then alive, no new ones to be made or consecrated after those
concessions. For by the Laws of this Land, after the death
of any Bishop, his Majesty is to send out his Writ of <hi>Cong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
d'Eslier</hi> to the Dean and Chapter of that place to elect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Which election being made, signified under the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Seal, and confirmed by the Royall assent; the King is to
send out his <hi>mandat</hi> to the Arch-Bishop of the Province, to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61619:269"/>
proceed to Consecration or Confirmation, as the case may
vary. And thereupon it must needs be, that when the Church
comes unto such a condition that there is no Dean and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
to <hi>elect,</hi> and no Arch-Bishop to <hi>consecrate</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi>
the person <hi>elected,</hi> there can be legally and regularly no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Bishops. I speak not this with reference to una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
Necessities, when a Church is not in a capacity of
acting according to the ancient Canons an establisht Laws;
but of the failing of Epis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>opall Succession, according to the
Laws of this Land, if those concessions had once passed into
Acts of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 1099. <hi>The Head-Quarters were at</hi> Windsor, <hi>where the
Army conclude the large Remonstrance, commended by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
Latter, and brought up to the Parliament by half a dozen
Officers.</hi> But by the heads of that <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> as they stand

in the place, though not in the Pamphlet That terrible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance

                     <q>That
two Regiments of Foot and some Troops of Horse took
up Quarters in <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Black-frier,</hi> and seized upon
20000.<hi>l</hi> in Weavers Hall, which they promised to repay
when the Lord Mayor and Common Councell please to
bring in the Arrears due from the City. They secured like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Treasures of <hi>Haberdashers</hi> and <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> Hall.</q>
Here we have first a <hi>seizure</hi> of the 20000.<hi>l</hi> in Weavars Hall
for the use of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Army, and a securing of the Treasures in
the other two, that they might not be employed against it.
The 20000<hi>l.</hi> which they found in the first was the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the 200000<hi>l.</hi> which was voted to be brought in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the raising of a New Presbyterian Army, under

and Sir <hi>Iohn Maynard</hi> as Lieutenant Generall, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that Army to conformity, which had so successively
served under the command of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax.</hi> But the
other two being hard names and not very easie of digestion,
require somewhat which may make them lighter to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the vulgar Reader.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which we are to know, that severall Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were made by the Lords and Commons for sequestring the
Estates of all such who had adhered unto the King, whom
(to distinguish them from their own party) they called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents;</hi>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:61619:271"/>
and a severe cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as well in reference to their <hi>personall</hi> as <hi>reall</hi> Estates;
to make them the more considerable in the purse of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.
But finding no such great profit to come in that way
(when every Cook who had the dressing of that dish had
lickt his fingers) as they did expect, they were contented to
admit them to a Composition. These Compositions to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at Goldsmiths Hall, by a select Committee consisting
of severall Members of the House of Commons, and some of
the most pragmaticall and stiff sort of Citizens, the parties

the payment of these Sums was the least part of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance

                  <p>For first, No man was admitted to treat with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee

                  <p>And secondly, It was Ordered by the said Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
on the 1. of <hi>November</hi> 1645. That <hi>the Committee of
Goldsmiths Hall should have power to tender the Solemn League
and Covenant to all persons that come out of the Kings Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>s
to that Committee to compound, and to secure such as should
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61619:271"/>
refuse to take it until they had conformed thereunto.</hi> 
                     <q>And by that
Covenant they were bound to endeavour the extirpation
of Popery and Prelacy (that is, Church-government by
Arch-Bishops and Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to defend the Kings
Person and Authority, no otherwise then in order to the
preservation and defence of the true Religion and Liberties
of the Kingdoms.</q> And if the party to compound were a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Catholick there was an Oath of Abjuration to be taken
also before any such Sequestration could be taken off, if once
laid upon him. By which he was to swear, <hi>That he abjured
and renounced the Popes Supremacy, that he beleeved not there
was any Transubstantiation, nor Purgatory, nor any worship to
be given to the consecrated Host, Crucifix, or Images, and that
salvation could not be merited by works, renouncing and abjuring
all Doctrines in defence of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se points.</hi> To such a miserable
necessity had they brought many of that party, that they
thought if safer (as they use to say) to trust God with their
souls, then such unmercifull men with their Lives, Fortunes,
and Estates.</p>
                  <p>And yet this was not thought to be a sufficient punishment
to them, but they must first passe through <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>berdashers Hall</hi>
(which is the last of my hard words) before they could be
free of the Goldsmiths. And in that Hall, they were to pay
the fifth and twentieth parts of their Estates as well real as
personall in present money; all men being brought within the
power of the Committee, not only who were called <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,</hi>
but such <hi>as had not voluntarily contributed to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in any place whatsoever,</hi> as appears by the Order of
the Commons bearing date <hi>August</hi> 25. 1646. By which last
clause <hi>more Grist was brought unto that Mill,</hi> then can be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
imagined; their Agents being very eager in that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit.
So that it was accounted a great benefit, as indeed it was,
to them who came in upon the Articles of <hi>Oxford, Faring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Wallinford, Exceter,</hi> and some other places, not only
that they were discharged from the payment of the fifth and
twentieth parts of their Estates at <hi>Haberdashers Hall,</hi> and

admitted to compound at <hi>Goldsmiths Hall</hi> for two years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase;

And by this fall there fell so generall an Oppression on the
Spirits of all sorts of people, that the generality of those who
plaied the principall parts in this sad Tragedy, became asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of their actings in it. The <hi>Scots</hi> who plaied the parts
of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and sold their naturall King and most bountifull
Master for a peece of money, when they saw he was like to
be condemned, repented, saying, <hi>that they had sinned in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
innocent bloud.</hi> For in their Letter to the Prince da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to such a degree of compunction, as to bring back the money
for which they had sold him, and to cast it down before the
chief Priests and Elders, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did. Or if they had there had
been no such purchase to be made with it, as was made with
that; both Kingdomes having been already an <hi>Aceldama,</hi>
or Field of bloud. The Presbyterians of both sorts as well
the Members of the House as those of the Assembly, and
their confederates in the City, who personated the chief
Priests and Elders amongst the Jews, had armed a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
with swords and staves (as well the Souldiers as the

                     <p>WHen I first heard of Mr. <hi>Sandersons Post-haste Reply,
&amp;c.</hi> and had caused the same to be read over, It
was not in my thoughts to discend so much beneath my self,
as to make any Answer to it; such scurrulous Pamphlets
dying soonest, when there is less notice taken of them:
Patience and contempt (<hi>&amp; tulere ista &amp; reliquere,</hi> as we
know who did) are commonly the most approved remedies
against all such Calumnies, as for the most part do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a petulant malice: But being there is in it some
matter of charge and Crimination, I have been advised by
some friends to acquit my self of the least, otherwise I
might be thought to confess my self guilty of the crimes
objected, and wrong my innocence by an obstinate and
affected silence: I have therefore yielded so far unto their
desires, as to return an Answer to so much of the Pamphlet
as contains matter of accusation, which I shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the rest, leaving the <hi>rif-raf</hi> and scurrilities of it (which
make up the greatest part of that two penny trifles, either
unto some further consideration, or to none at all.</p>

think himself to be over-matched, not in regard of any
difference in such personal abilities as either of us may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, but in relation to those many hands which are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against him in this quarrel, for if it were too much for
<hi>Hercules</hi> to contend with two, <hi>ne Hercules contra duos,</hi> as
the proverb hath it) good reason hath he to complain of
being pressed and put to it by so many <hi>Helpers</hi> as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to joyn unto me: He tells me indifinitely of my <hi>Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
page</hi> 5. of the charitable Collections of my numerous
<hi>Helpers, pag. 23. Helpers</hi> import a plural number, and <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Helpers</hi> signifie a multitude; and who can stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
so many when they joyn together? But I would not
have my <hi>Squire</hi> affright himself with these needless terrors:
my helpers are but few in number, though many in vertue
and effect; for though I cannot say that I have many <hi>help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
yet I cannot but confess in all humble gratitude, that I
have one great <hi>Helper,</hi> which is <hi>instar omnium,</hi> even the
Lord my God: <hi>Aurilium meum a domino,</hi> my help cometh
even from the Lord <hi>which hath made heaven and earth,</hi> as the
Psalmist hath it. And I can say with the like humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements
of Gods mercies to me, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, when
he was askt about the quick dispatch which he had made in

at the present but a raw young fellow, who knows no

                        <note n="i" place="margin">p. 5.</note>. It seems by this

and pious men.</hi> but though it be no news in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Squire Sanderson,</hi> yet I can confidently say, that it
is <hi>Novum crimen, &amp; anie hoc tempus in auditum,</hi> a crime
which never was charged before upon D. <hi>Heylin,</hi> who hath
hitherto appeared an <hi>Advocate for the dead and living,</hi> as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as they have come under the unjust censures of some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Writers. And this the former <hi>Observations</hi> together
with these <hi>Animadversions</hi> and <hi>Advertisements</hi> (when he
hath any grounds of truth to proceed upon) do most clearly
evidence. Against which Declaration, the Squire is able to
instance only in one particular, whereas indeed he hath
but one particular<note n="k" place="margin">Ibid</note> to make <hi>instance</hi> in; his instancing
in no more but that particular being not so much an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his super-abundant charity towards the <hi>Respondent,</hi>
as of his little store of matter wherewithall to charge him.
And yet this one and onely instance touching D. <hi>Prideaux</hi>
hath so little truth in it, that it is only one degree removed
from a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ander. For first (omitting that D. <hi>Heylin</hi> took his
degree <hi>An.</hi> 1633. and not in 1635. as the <hi>Pamphleter</hi> makes
it, <hi>the said Doctor never scandalized him at Court to the late
King being then at Woodstock</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">p. 6.</note>: the said Doctor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
making any such information to the King against
D. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> either at <hi>Woodstock</hi> or elsewhere. Secondly,
The said Doctor never made any such information to any
other person or persons (if every thing which is delivered
in the way of discourse may not be brought within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe

his Majesties ear. And for the proof hereof, since I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

substance and effect of that which he delivered to
the King for his justification, as indeed it doth not. For
the truth is that this Paper was digested by D. <hi>Prideaux</hi>
as soon as he returned to <hi>Oxon,</hi> coppied out and disperst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
by some of his own party and perswasions, to keep
up the credit of the cause. And though at first it carried the

D.</hi> Prideaux <hi>to the Information given in against him by D.</hi>
Heylin<note n="n" place="margin">Ibid.</note>; yet afterwards upon a <hi>melius inquirendum</hi>

                     <p>And here I might conclude this point touching the <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing</hi>
and <hi>disturbing</hi> of D. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> did I not finde that
by the unseasonable publishing of that Antiquated and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Paper, the <hi>Respondent</hi> had not been <hi>disturbed</hi> and
<hi>traduced</hi> in a far courser manner then he was, the Doctor
had those passions and infirmities which are incident to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men of lesse ability, and having twice before exposed
the <hi>Respondent</hi> to some disadvantages in the point of same
and reputation, he was the more easily inclined to pursue his
blow, and render him obnoxious (as much as possibly he
could) to the publike censure: The story whereof I shall
lay down upon this occasion, and hope that I may safely
do it without the imputation of affecting the <hi>fresh credit of

Know then that on tht 24. day of <hi>April Anno</hi> 1627. I
answered in the Divinity Schools at <hi>Oxon</hi> upon these two
Questions, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>2. <hi>An Ecclesia possit errare;</hi> Both which I determined in
the <hi>Negative.</hi> And in the stating of the first I fell upon a
different way from that of D. <hi>Prideaux</hi> in his Lecture <hi>de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitate
Ecclesiae,</hi> and other Tractates of and about that time,
in which the visibility of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
of the renowned Church of <hi>England,</hi> was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
proved, then by looking for it into the scattered
conventicles of the <hi>Berengarians</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Waldenses</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Wicklifists</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which manner of proceeding not being liked by the <hi>Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
as that which utterly discontinued that succession in the
<hi>Ecclesiasticall Hierarchy,</hi> which the Church of <hi>England</hi> clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from the very Apostles; he rather chose to look for a
continual visible Church in <hi>Asia, Aethiopia, Greece, Italy,</hi> yea,
and <hi>Rome</hi> it self, as also in all the Western Provinces then
subject to the power of the <hi>Popes</hi> thereof; And for the
proof whereof he shewed,</p>
                     <p>First, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> received no successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of doctrine, or government from any of the scattered
<hi>Conventicles</hi> before remembred.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the <hi>Wicklifsists</hi> together (which the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remembred) held many <hi>Heterodoxes</hi> in Religion, as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the established doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as any point which was maintained at that time in the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thirdly, That the Learned Writers of that Church,
&amp; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself amongst them have stood up as cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and stoutly in maintenance of some fundamental Points of
the Christian Faith against the <hi>Socinians, Anabaptists, Anti-Trinitarians,</hi> and other <hi>Hereticks</hi> of these last ages, as any of
the Divines and other learned men of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
Which point I closed with these words, <hi>viz. Vtinam,

and this so much displeased the Doctor, that as soon as
the <hi>Respondent</hi> had ended his determination, he fell most
heavily upon him, calling him by the odious names of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picola,
Bellarminianus, Pontificius,</hi> and I wot not what, and
bitterly complaining to the younger part of his Audients
(to whom he made the greatest part of his addresses) of
the unprofitable pains he had took amongst them; if
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whom he laboured to decry for so many years,
should now be honoured with the Title of <hi>Nobilissimus;</hi> The
like he also did (<hi>tantaene animis caelestibus irae?</hi>) at another
time when the <hi>Respondent</hi> changed his Copy, and acted the
part of the <hi>Prior Opponent,</hi> loding the poor young man with
so many reproaches that he was branded for a Papist before
he understood what Popery was. And because this report
should not get footing in the Court before him, in his first
Sermon preached before the King, which was in <hi>November</hi>

and corruptions in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to be far enough from any inclinations to the <hi>Romish</hi>
Religion, as afterwards in the Year 1638. when that clamour
was revived again, he gave such satisfaction in his third
and fourth Sermon upon the Parable of the <hi>Tares,</hi> that some
of the Court (who before had been otherwise perswaded of
him) did not stick to say, <hi>That he had done more towards the

afterwards that he could see no hope of a fair Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
from so foul a beginning, and not as being <hi>tired with
the tedious Preface of the</hi> Respondent <hi>before the Disputations
begun,</hi> which whether it were tedious or impertinent or
not, may perhaps be seen hereafter upon this occasion.)</p>
                     <p>But to proceed, upon the breaking of this blow, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
fell on roundly to his <hi>Argumentation,</hi> and in the heat
thereof insisted upon those extravagant expressions (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any such qualification of them as is found in the Paper)
which made the matter of the <hi>Information</hi> which is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, and for which, if he received any check from the
King at <hi>Woodstock,</hi> it is no more then what he had received
at the same place but two years before, as afore is said.
Which notwithstanding the <hi>Book of Articles</hi> was printed
the next Year at <hi>Oxon</hi> in the Latine tongue, according to
the Copy in the said <hi>Harmony of Confessions,</hi> or to a corrupt
Edition of them, <hi>Anno</hi> 1571. in which that clause had been
omitted, to the great animation of the Puritan party, who
then began afresh to call in question the Authority of the
Church in the points aforesaid: For which, as D. <hi>Pride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux</hi>
(by whose encouragement it was supposed to have been
done) received a third check from the Arch-bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>
then Chancellor of that University; So the Printers
were constrained to re-print the Book or that part of it at
<pb facs="tcp:61619:289"/>
the least, according to the genuine and ancient Copies.</p>
                     <p>And here I should have parted with D. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> but
that there is somewhat in the Paper (as it is now publisht
to the world by M. <hi>Sanderson</hi>) which is thought fit to have
an answer though not held worthy of that honour when it
was secretly disperst in scattered Copies. The Paper tels us

                        </hi> which is supposed to have been given (and makes

is as sure that he never <hi>excluded King and Parliament from
being parts of the Church,</hi> that is to say of the diffusive body
of it, but denied them to be members of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> that
is to say, the Church of <hi>England</hi> represented in a <hi>Nationall</hi>
Councel, to which the power of decreeing Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,

by the <hi>Articles:</hi> Which as it did deserve no <hi>Hisse,</hi> so the
Respondent is assured no such <hi>hisse</hi> was given when those
words were spoken. If any <hi>hisse</hi> were given at all, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
there was, it might be rather when the Doctor went
about to prove that it was not the <hi>Convocation</hi> but the <hi>High
Court of Parliament</hi> which had the power of ordering mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the Church, in making <hi>Canons,</hi> ordaining <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
and determining <hi>Controversies</hi> in Religion, and could
finde out no other <hi>medium</hi> to make it good but the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Sir Ed. <hi>Cooke</hi> (a learned but meer common Lawyer) in

gave place to the next Opponent, which put an end unto the
heats of that Disputation: In which if the Doctor did affirm
that the Church was <hi>Mera Chimaera</hi>
                        <note place="margin">p. 6.</note>, as it seems
he did, what other plaister soever he might finde

are of most unquestioned credit amongst the Learned: Thus
