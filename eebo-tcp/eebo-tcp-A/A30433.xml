         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and

                  <p>Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>BJECTS that raise Compassion,
and beget Sorrow, cannot be
look'd on with indifferent eyes by
those who have a right Prospect,
and a just Sense of things. To an
ordinary Spectator, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> must
have appeared one of the Glories
of the World, especially as it was beautified and
fortified by <hi>Herod.</hi> Its Temple standing on an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
was so August in it Self, and so Sacred in
its Use, as being dedicated to the Service of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, that the very sight of it must have begot
a Reverence; and to a born <hi>Iew</hi> must have given
all the Pride which the Native of any Countrey
may be apt to feel in himself, when he sees the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City full both of People and of Wealth, shining
with a fresh Lustre, and adorned with all the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Art, as well as hallowed by the special marks
of the Favour and Presence of God.</p>
            <p>But all this must have appeared as a vain Pageant
to one that could see through that false varnish,
and that likewise by reason of the treasures of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Knowledg that were in him, saw their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Fate; he saw that Misery, which tho it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65712:4"/>
fell not on them till almost Forty Years after this
yet did then to him represent <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as a heap of
Stones, the Temple on Fire, and the Inhabitants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by Famine, or by the Sword; nor could
so Divine a Mind find any ease in so dismal a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
from this, That the <hi>Iews</hi> rejecting of him,
and the cruel Treatment that he was to reeeive
from them, was to be revenged in so terrible a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
This to a spiteful mind would have afforded some
content; but he that was so full of Universal Love
and Goodness, could not entertain such ill-natur'd
thoughts. Nor could, on the other hand, all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to which he himself was to be advanced long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the effusion of the Wrath of God upon this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
make him less sensible of this Misery, because
neither he nor his Followers were to share in it. It
was true Pity and Compassion that were his Motives,
which both drew tears from his eyes, and also the
sad wish that follows. His sense of their sins was from
the same pure and disinteressed Motives, for he had
none of his own to return into his mind, when he
considered theirs, to make the Sorrow more melting.
And tho that bloody Scene which he himself was so
soon to go through, might, according to such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
as we act by, have so entirely possessed his
thoughts, that no room should have been left for
the compassionating others; yet even in this near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to that bitter Cup which he was so soon to drink,
he considered their miseries that were more remote,
with all the tendernesses of hearty Sorrow and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.</p>
            <p>In imitation then of the Author of our
Faith, it does much more become us to
look on this great City that has risen out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65712:4"/>
of its ashes with so much Glory, that is now
the Treasure as well as the Pride of the Nation,
that has so many characters of Greatness, as well as
Wealth in every corner of it; but that at the same
time has contracted so much guilt, is covered with
so much Defilement, Luxury, and Excess; is agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with such Factions, and these acted with so
much animosity; but not to view all this without
feeling a tenderness run through all our Powers, and
give us many sad and melting thoughts, which ought
to affect us so much the more sensibly, when we
find how great a share we our selves have in these
sins, which we lament in others; so that the Words
of our Saviour,<note place="margin">23 Luk. 28</note> 
               <hi>Weep not for me, but weep for your
selves,</hi> may be applied to us in another sense, since
upon strict enquiry, we shall find that we are not
pure enough our selves, to be capable of such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interessed
sorrow, while we weep over <hi>London:</hi> We
must first begin and lament our selves, while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
in how many places of this City, and in
how many several ways we have dishonoured God,
and contributed our proportion towards the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Wrath of God against us. Our melancholly
thoughts also must have another mixture in them,
since if this place is to be made as great a scene of
the Judgments of God, as it has been hitherto of
his Mercies, we must be all involved in it. This
thought does indeed render our Compassion for the
Publick, less generous; but it will perhaps make it
more sensible to us. In a word, as there is nothing
that shews that a man has truly repented of his own
sins, more than a tender sense of the Wrath of God;
so nothing proves a man to be possessed with a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Love and Charity, more than a feeling sense
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65712:5"/>
of the sins and miseries of others; and to weep over
ones Countrey or City, as it is the most important
service that can be done the Publick, which may
delay, if not quite divert the Judgments of God; so
this is that which is in every ones Power to do:
Wealth is not necessary for this aid; yet perhaps
there is scarce any one duty that is more universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neglected, than this is; ill men do not so much
as once think of it; men of a low degree of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
have not elevation of soul enough for it; and
the only men that are capable of doing this service
to their Countrey, have so much Modesty and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
and are so depressed with the sense of their
own sins, that they are tempted to think it is an
over valuing themselves, and a sort of a Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for them to intercede for others, or for their
Countrey.</p>
            <p>But we are Members of one Political Body, and
must all bear a share in the Prosperity, or the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of the Nation; so that if a nobler Principle
does not engage us to this Duty, yet at least Self-love
should work on us; since we cannot flatter our
selves so far, as to fancy, that if any general Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
should overtake the Land, or City, that we
our selves should be exempted from it. We are also
joined into a nearer Relation as we are become
Members of one Body, of which Christ is the Head;
and by this Union the same Spirit of Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
will be spread over the whole Body; so that
we will <hi>rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep
with them that weep.</hi> Since then the present state
of things, and the Commands of Authority, our
common Interests, as well as our Christian Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
do all concur to engage us, first of all to weep
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65712:5"/>
for our sins, and then to look over our Countrey,
and this <hi>the City of our Solemnities,</hi> and mourn over
them; let us go over the several branches of the
moving and emphatical words of our Saviour, and
apply them as far as the parallel goes, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state of things: in which let us consider,</p>
            <p>1. The Importance of this redoubling the word,
<hi>thou, even thou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Importance of these words,</hi> at least in
this thy day.</p>
            <p>3. What are <hi>the things that concern the peace</hi> of a
Nation, and how they may be known.</p>
            <p>And <hi>4thly,</hi> what are the happy effects of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's
knowing them: This, tho not expressed, yet
is implied in the wish in which the period is laid,
without being regularly closed.</p>
            <p>I have not read the last words of this Verse, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will I speak to them, for they might seem to
carry too dismal a sound with them; yet, I hope,
all that hear me, will so seriously reflect on them,
that by their so doing, they may come not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to us. For though perhaps in the present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
posture in which we are, it is but too true
that <hi>now they are hid from our eyes;</hi> yet if we will
seriously attend to those things of which I am to
treat, then we shall be delivered from so heavy a
Sentence as is imported in them. To return.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>If thou, even thou;</hi> the words carry plainly a
weight in them, which to comprehend aright, we
must consider the state in which <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was at
that time, and that with respect to both the good
and bad of it. It was the Capital of that Nation,
that God had chosen out of all the Families of the
Earth to be his own Inheritance: it was the place
where his Name was called upon, and to which the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65712:6"/>
Worship of God was appropriated. It was now so
enriched by <hi>Herod,</hi> who having heaped up Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
like another <hi>Solomon,</hi> had laid them out in the
rebuilding the Temple, which in a course of 46
years was carried on to so vast a Magnificence, that
it was become indeed one of the Wonders of the
World: It was also so well fortified, and had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it such a number of Inhabitants, who had such
a violent love to their Countrey, and so much zeal
for it, that one might have thought they were in
no danger of being besieged; but that they were
strong enough to have gone out and fought any
Enemy that could have gone against them: and
that no Siege could have signified any thing, but to
have ruined the Army that should have attempted it:
so that by this <hi>thou, even thou,</hi> in one view we may
understand a City dedicated to God, and under his
Protection; a City well fortified, full of Wealth,
and full of People, and yet to such a City it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to <hi>know the things that belonged to their peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, before we go farther, Reflections offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to us in abundance: This our City has been
under signal Characters of the Protection of God; it
has been preserved from violent Concussions, and
from the hand of an Enemy, when all the rest of the
Nation has had their turns in the Accidents of War:
It is true, two signal strokes from Heaven that came
one after another, a wasting Pestilence, and a devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Fire that seemed to threaten it with ruine, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that God corrected them, tho he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them over to the will of their Enemies; The
quick recovery of the City, carries the marks of a
particular car of Heaven; and the haste that has
been made to raise up so many of these holy and
beautiful Houses, in which God is worshipped, may
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65712:6"/>
be reckoned among the Glories, and the Defences
of this place. Its vast Wealth, the increase of the
Inhabitants, the prodigious extent of it, and the
zeal with which all seem to be heated for preserving
the Honour of the City, bring us so near a Parallel
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that in this, <hi>thou, even thou,</hi> we may
find the Characters of a City, hitherto highly blessed
of God, and full of the Good things of this life; yet
in the midst of all this Wealth, and Abundance, there
is great need of preparing for a Storm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> If we consider the state of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with
relation to Religion; the <hi>Iews</hi> who had shewed so
violent an Inclination to Idolatry before they were
carried Captives to <hi>Babylon,</hi> were there so absolutely
cured of that, that ever after they expressed the
strictest Zeal possible against every step towards Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
or the least appearance of it. We see how
they resisted the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> in their Attempts
for profaning the Temple, and defiling their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
and not long after our Saviour's death, when
<hi>Caligula</hi> ordered his Statue to be set up in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they were all in so great a commotion upon it,
that an Embassy was sent to him, to shew that they
could not bear any thing that looked like a departure
from the God of their Fathers, which was urged by
<hi>Philo</hi> that went on the Embassy, in terms full of
zeal, that expressed a firm resolution of suffering
every thing, rather than endure such an affront to
be done to their Religion. To this Zeal against Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
they added a most punctual observation of all
the Rituals of their Religion; and not satisfied with
those which <hi>Moses</hi> had appointed, they had added
many new ones, which they reckoned the <hi>setting a
hedge about the Law;</hi> securing the observance of the
commanded Rites by those, which, according to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65712:7"/>
Tradition of the Elders, had been for some Ages obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
among them; so here was a City that was both
free from Idolatry, and exact in obeying the Laws
of God, that yet is warned of a great danger in these
words, <hi>Thou, even thou.</hi> I do not know whether our
conformity to them, as to these particulars, goes so
high, or is so Universal, yet something like it we
have. Great Zeal has appeared against the Idolatry
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with a constancy in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, that has amazed all the World: the
steps made towards that, alarmed the Nation, and
this City in particular: and it appeared that you could
not bear those who called themselves <hi>the Church of
God, but that are the Synagogue of Satan.</hi> You have
shewed also such firmness to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and to the Established Religion, as not to bear any
thing that declined from it, either to the right hand,
or to the left. Yet after all this, we may have cause to
apprehend the Wrath of God, notwithstanding it all,
if our Religion goes no farther, than the <hi>cleansing the
outside, or the tything the mint and anise.</hi> If we have
Idols in our hearts, tho we have purged our Churches
of them; if we forget God at the same time, that we
do not worship Images; and if while we are zealous
in lesser matters, we neglect the great things, of
<hi>righteousness, mercy and faith,</hi> then all our Negative
Religion, our No Popery, and all our zeal for the
Church, when it does not oblige us to conform our
selves to her Dictates, and Rules, as well as to be hot
and eager in her defence, will not secure us, but
that this <hi>Thou, even thou,</hi> may belong to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> at this time had so fallen from all
the true Principles of Religion, that even their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
had embittered their Spirits, so that they were
rather the worse for it, than the better. The Pried
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65712:7"/>
and Affectation of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that had no real
worth under it to support it, set them on all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Slander and Injustice, of Falshood and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty:
so that when they found they could not stand
before the true worth of our Saviour, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
they then fell upon the blackest Calumnies, and
most violent Rage for destroying those before whom
they could not maintain their ground upon an equal
foot: their Morals were universally depraved, and
their Tempers so vitiated, that under the appearance
of an adhering strictly to their Religion, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was a Nation that did more totally fall from the
power and life of Godliness, than they did: they
were both cruel and barbarous, and not satisfied with
shedding the Blood of Christ, they filled up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of their Iniquities by persecuting his Followers
every-where: so that under a shew of preserving
their Law, they had entirely lost all the true and
good Principles of Religion; and so had contracted
a vast guilt, besides that heavy load of the Blood of
him that was the Heir of the Vineyard, <hi>whom they
killed, that the Inheritance might be their own.</hi> And
thus the view of a Nation that was both so corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that lay under so heavy a load of guilt, leads
us to the full importance of this, <hi>If thou, even thou;</hi>
that even after all their Sins, and all their guilt, there
was still room for Repentance. If this Nation has
brought it self into the like state of having the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Truth, and seeming zealous about it, and
yet falling from all that is pure and excellent in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
into a fierceness about some Inconsiderable
Matters; if while we seem to have a great concern
for our Religion, we have none at all for our Morals;
if Malice and ill-nature, if Fury and Cruelty, do not
only transport us to all excesses, but make us cover
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65712:8"/>
and justify them with pretexts of Religion; if our
Cities and Countrey have been defiled with all the
brutalities that humane Nature is capable of; If, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of mutual Love and Forgiveness, we hate, and
study to destroy one another; If, instead of Truth,
there is nothing but Injustice; and instead of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
there is nothig but Violence and Deceit,
then we will find our selves under the worst part of
that which is intimated in this, <hi>If thou, even thou.</hi>
Yet after all, there is somewhat that gives comfort
in this; for if a City charged with all the blood that
was shed from <hi>Abel</hi> down to <hi>Zacharias,</hi> was even after
all that, admitted to a possibility of escaping the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, by a true Repentance, then we see that
we who have reason to hope that we are not near so
guilty as they were, are not yet quite desperate.</p>
            <p>2. From this, I go next to consider the Importance of
these words, <hi>at least in this thy day.</hi> In Scripture this
word of the <hi>day,</hi> or time of a Nation, stands in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sense:<note place="margin">Isa. 49. 8.</note> sometimes for a <hi>time of mercy and kindness,
an acceptable time, and day of Salvation:</hi> sometimes
for a day of trial,<note place="margin">Vers. 43.</note> or <hi>visitation,</hi> as it is in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words. The meaning of the first is, that when
God receives Nations into his Protection and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
he not being as a Man, inconstant and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
does not easily repent of the good that he
shews them, nor change his Methods towards them:
and therefore till their Sins become so high, and
crying, that it does not agree with the honour of
his Providence not to shew his anger against them,
he bears with their Offences; or, if he corrects them
for them, he does it not in anger; he will chastise
them,<note place="margin">Psal. 89. 30, 31, 32, 33.</note> as he said with relation to <hi>David</hi>'s Posterity, <hi>If
they sin against him, but he will not quite cast them off;
he will visit their Transgressions with the rod, and their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65712:8"/>
Iniquity with stripes; Nevertheless he will not take his
loving kindness utterly from them.</hi> And thus we find it
was often said of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation in the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
that God would have cast them off, if he had not
remembred <hi>Abraham, Israel</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> so in this sense
the <hi>Iews</hi> were still God's People, and in Covenant
with him. To them were the first offers of the <hi>Messias</hi>
to be made; and therefore if while that Covenant last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and they were still under the Privileges of it, they
could have applied themselves to <hi>know the things that
belonged to their Peace,</hi> they might still have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
their Title to his Favour. The second sense of
this <hi>thy day,</hi> imports that there is a time of Trial
and Repentance granted by God, even to guilty Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in order to their preventing the last strokes of
his Wrath, and the final Calamity that is threatned.
When God was provoked by the sins of the old
World to bring a flood upon the whole Earth,<note place="margin">6. Gen. 3.</note> he
gave them the space of 120 years for a time of warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in which <hi>Noah</hi> continued as a Preacher of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
denouncing to them the Judgments that
were to be poured out upon them:<note place="margin">3. Jonas 4.</note> Even <hi>Niniveh</hi>
had 40 days given to them for a time of Repentance,
by which their final destruction might be respited,
as in fact it proved to be. We find upon three great
occasions, that God granted to the people of the
<hi>Iews</hi> a time of 40 Years: When they rebelled
against him at <hi>Kadesh-barnea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">14. Numb. 33, 34.</note> and would not go in
and possess the Land; he declared that none of them
except two, should enter into it, but that they should
fall in the Wilderness; yet they were to wander in
it 40 Years; for so long does the Psalm say, <hi>that he
was grieved with that generation.</hi> Next, when <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses</hi>
had so defiled <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with both Idolatry
and Bloodshed,<note place="margin">2 Kings 24. 4.</note> that it is said that <hi>God would not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65712:9"/>
it;</hi> yet upon <hi>Iosiah</hi>'s serious Repentance, and
purging the Temple, which he began in the 12th
Year of his Reign, God granted to the <hi>Iews</hi> 40
Years Reprieve; for it was just so long between the
12th of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s Captivity: And the
third 40 Years was from the first year of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Preaching, to the final Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi>
they were then in the <hi>day of their Visitation,</hi> which
grew gradually upon them; the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
every day more and more intolerable, and their
humors growing more and more boisterous. Towards
the conclusion of this time of their Trial, the alarms
grew higher; many Prodigies, and other extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
things appearing, that seemed to warn them of
the Wrath to come. <hi>Cestius Gallus</hi> came with an Army
against them four Years before their Destruction, and
took the lower City; and tho he did retreat with
some loss, yet they had all reason to conclude that the
<hi>Romans</hi> could not bear such a Repulse: After this, <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee</hi>
was conquer'd and destroy'd: All these were warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and were the last immediate Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of its final Destruction. This being then the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the meaning of these Words, <hi>In this thy day,</hi> it
will not be uneasie to see how they may belong to us.</p>
            <p>It is still with us a <hi>day of mercy;</hi> and when we
consider the whole state of <hi>Christendom,</hi> particularly
of many parts of it, ever since the Reformation was
established, we must acknowledg that it has been of
a very long continuance; we had 80 years of Peace
and Plenty, Prosperity and Victory, as well as of
the Purity of the Gospel, from the year 1558, to
the year 1638; a thing without example in Modern
History. In all that time, unless it were a few months
Plague at two several times, we had not any one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
stroke, to be set against the many publick Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
we enjoyed; but when we were so happy that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65712:9"/>
we had no Enemies that could hurt us, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
our own Enemies, and then the Sword ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
among us; but even that was so allayed, that
we fell not under the Fury that commonly attends
Civil Wars. And both Sides in their mutual Heats,
did yet so far remember that they were English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that neither of them brought over Strangers,
nor gave them footing among us. We have now
enjoyed an Age of Peace and Plenty, and with that
have had the Gospel among us, with that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and fulness, that no Age has produced more
Light, better Explanations of Divine Matters,
and fuller Proofs of their Truth. And though we
have seen many Storms gathering thick and black
over our Heads, so that we had reason to look
for most terrible Confusions; yet all these have
gone over us in so inoffensive a manner, that perhaps
many do not enough feel the Blessings of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
because we only saw, but did not feel
what our Enemies had designed against us; and
this being a thing which some had not Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and others had not Capacity enough to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend;
we despise, or perhaps even loath our
Deliverance; because we neither value the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
which is preserved among us, nor understand
how near we were the losing it. The Quiet we
now enjoy, and the Security we live in while, all
the World about us is on fire, is no ordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of a particular favour of Heaven to us;
and after so long a course of Goodness, we have
reason to conclude that God will not change his
Methods, if our Sins do not call aloud for it.</p>
            <p>We have likewise reason to think we are now
in a <hi>Day of Visitation,</hi> and that terrible Calamities
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65712:10"/>
are not far from us, if <hi>in this our Day,</hi> we are
not wise nor good enough to prevent it. We have
seen the Cup of God's Wrath, going round all the
Protestant Churches, which having fallen from
their first Love, and forsaken their first Purity,
mixing into the Vanities of the World, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
their Manners notwithstanding the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Doctrine and Worship, have been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
visited by God: Some fatally broken and
extirpated, as the Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi>
others brought near utter ruin, as the
Churches of <hi>Hungary</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and others;
though not visited so heavily, yet were brought
very low; so were the Churches of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
18</hi> Years ago, and many Churches in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
But when all these things have been set
before our Eyes, and when the Visitation is
brought into our <hi>Galile,</hi> if I may so speak, I mean
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and has cast that Island, and all its
Inhabitants, into such Convulsions, that we cannot
yet form a clear Judgment how far they may be
consumed by this Fire, which now devours them,
before they come out of it; While these things
have gone round about us, why should we think
that we can escape? Are we better than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who have suffered? Or, can we think that
God is partial to us? And when God suffered them
so far to break in upon us, that we saw an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Worship openly, and in contempt of the
Laws both of God and of the Land, set up among
us; and an open Treaty set on foot for bringing
us under the Tyranny of <hi>Rome:</hi> When we were
under the Ministry of a Jesuit, and the Influences
of <hi>France;</hi> when we saw Breaches made upon the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65712:10"/>
most sacred of our Laws, and the Subversion of
the whole attempted: This was certainly such a
Day of Visitation, as <hi>Cestius Gallus</hi> his shewing
the Roman Army was to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi>
did not any more fear that Enemy, because they
had strength enough once to stand it out against
so faint an Attempt; but the next return of the
Romans was more formidable, and proved in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
fatal to them. If we either grow to have
milder Thoughts of our Enemies the modern
Romans, and fancy they are not quite so bad as
our Fears may have Pictured them to us; or if
we despise their Forces, and fancy that we have not
so considerable an Enemy in them as we were
made believe; we may be soon undeceived of both
Errours, when it will be too late for us upon the
discovery to correct them.</p>
            <p>In Sum, We must not think that such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Providences as have of late occurred both
at home and abroad, are Matters that deserve no
Reflections to be made upon them: They are <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says,</hi>
and perhaps the <hi>last Essays</hi> that are to be made
upon us, to try if our Dangers, or our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Fates, can make us wiser or better.</p>
            <p>III. And this leads me to the third Particular,
What are those things which concern the <hi>Peace
of a Nation,</hi> and how they may be <hi>known.</hi> The
obvious Division of this is unto those things
that belong to our Peace with God, those things
that may preserve the whole Nation, and its Peace
as it is a complicated Body; and the things which
belong to our Peace among our selves, one with
another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65712:11"/>
We cannot make any Reflections on our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
with relation to God, without observing
that he has been offended in a most eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
while Religion has been so visibly neglected
by those who have pretended the most to it;
while not only Vices of all Sorts have abounded
among us, and have been acted with so high a
Hand, as if the Actors had equally despised the
Judgments of God and the Reproaches of Men;
but what do I say, <hi>Reproaches!</hi> Men have been so
far from being out of countenance for their Sins,
that they have valued themselves upon them, and
gloried in them. How loud is the Cry of the
Luxury, the Injustice, the Fraud, the Violence,
and the Impieties of this Place? How have they
gone up into the Ears of the Lord of Hosts? And
will he bear with us for ever? But as if the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of others Age and Countries had not
been enough to provoke him to Anger, we have
found out and added new ones to those of past
Times. Perhaps in no Age or Nation the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
that Men pretend to believe, has been so open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not only attacked and questioned, but laughed
at and rejected with all the Indignities of impious
Scorn, as it has been among us: Others who had
more Modesty and Decency in their Natures, and
so could not rise up to that pitch of Insolence,
yet have been generally corrupted into Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
so that perhaps scarce any Nation now under
Heaven believe less of the Religion that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
in it, than we do. Now this is as much
beyond all other Sins, as High Treason is beyond
all other legal Offences. This strikes at the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and Authority of God, and at every Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65712:11"/>
of Religion, since it overturns the Foundation
upon which all is built. And to what a height is
the Cry of our Iniquities risen, when there is
scarce a leud Company that get together, that do
not make the most solemn and sacred things in the
World, the Subjects of their Mirth and Diversion?
<hi>Shall not I visit for these things,<note place="margin">Ierem. 5. 29.</note> saith the Lord? shall
not my Soul be avenged on such a People as this is?</hi>
Besides this that dissolves all Sense of Religion,
this Age has produced another that has as much
dissolved all Morality, which is the open affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the State of Marriage: Other Ages have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
produced high Offences against it, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Breaches of that Faith; but to see an open and
avowed Contempt of it done in the Sight of the
Sun, and as it were in spite of that State, is what
no Christian Nation has so publickly owned as
ours has done.</p>
            <p>Whilst God has been so highly provoked, and
when we saw our selves in such a desperate State,
as that under which we lately groaned, who were
then repenting of their Sins, and turning to God?
Who were putting from them the Evil of their
Ways? Who were cleansing themselves from their
Impieties and Impurities, from their Injustice and
Oppression? Such a Preparation as this had made
us both more fit for a Deliverance, and more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of improving it to all those Ends for which
God had bless'd us with it, If this great Work
sticks in the Birth so long, it is because Men have
not repented of their Sins, but have returned to
them, or rather have openly continued in them:
and while our Divisions make us sharp-sighted to
find out one anothers Faults, we make no other
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65712:12"/>
use of the Discovery, but to reproach others for
them, and to represent them more odious to our
selves and others, upon that Account. But who
considers these things as a Christian ought to do,
who animated with the Spirit of Christ, mourns
over them, and humbles himself before God for
them? as <hi>Ezra</hi> did, who finding that the People of
the <hi>Iews</hi> after their Return out of the Captivity,
were beginning to fall back into their old Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<hi>Rent his Clothes, and sat astonished; he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed,<note place="margin">Ezrah 9. 3, 4.</note>
and blushed to lift up his Face to God:</hi> and
in Words full of tender sense, he laments their Sins.
<hi>Now for a little space Grace hath been shewed us,<note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> to
give us a little reviving. And now Lord, what shall
we say after this?<note place="margin">Ver. 10.</note> for we have forsaken thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.<note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note>
And after all that is come upon us for our
our evil Deeds, seeing that thou our God hast punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us less than our Iniquities deserve,<note place="margin">Ver. 14, 15.</note> and hast given
us such a Deliverance as this, should we again break
thy Commandments, wouldst not thou be angry with
us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should
be no Remnant nor escaping? O Lord God of</hi> Israel,
<hi>thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is
this day: Behold, we are before thee in our Trespasses,
for we cannot stand before thee, because of this.</hi> Such
Acts of Sorrow as these, rising from a sense of the
Dishonour done to God, and of the Danger the
Nation is in by it, were a Service to the Publick,
beyond all that can ever rise from that false Heat,
with which any of us may be animated. Other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
require good Heads, or great Credit, and much
Wealth; but this is that which every Person of a
pure &amp; devout Mind can offer up for their Country.
But alas, can it be expected that those who do not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65712:12"/>
mourn for their own Sins, should mourn for the
Sins of others? which will perhaps appear an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
piece of Melancholy to those who do
not consider that we being all one Body in Christ,
the Communion of the Saints, of which this is a
main part, is established by God, by which we are
obliged to mix our Tears and Prayers together
as one Body, not doubting but that these have
their Effect before God; at least they shall return
into our own Bosom, and our Charity shall not
want its Reward; for though the Sins of a Nation
were grown to that height, that though <hi>Noah, Iob,</hi>
and <hi>Daniel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 14. 16.</note> were among them, and interceding
for them, they <hi>could only deliver their own Souls,
by their Righteousness,</hi> yet still that is a happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
            <p>Those who mourn in <hi>Sion,</hi> shall be marked on
their Fore-heads: and when the destroying
Calamity shall have a Commission to march over
the Land,<note place="margin">Ezek. 9. 4, 7.</note> 
               <hi>beginning even at the Sanctuary,</hi> at that
Order of Men, who should have been the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
for others, but that have rather heightned
the Provocation by their Sins, than those who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that Mark, shall be exempted, and either be
quite preserved from the common Calamity, or at
least shall have a distinguished Fate in it, for they
may hope for an easier Fall and gentler Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
This is then the chief thing <hi>that belongs
to our Peace,</hi> our Reconciliation with God; so
that he turns from the Fierceness of his Anger,
and lifts up upon us the Light of his Countenance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>2d</hi> thing that concerns <hi>our Peace,</hi> is the
falling upon proper and effectual Means for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
our selves, and the Nation, for this is <hi>our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65712:13"/>
Peace.</hi> We who have been accustomed to ease and
fulness, who cannot bear the lessening any one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
either of our Luxury or of our Vanity, have
mean Notions of what belongs to <hi>our Peace,</hi> if
we think that any thing is too much which secures
it to us. We have an Enemy in head of us, who
has ever looked on the Prosperity and Plenty of
this Island, as that which stood most in the way of
his <hi>Glory:</hi> and though he could more easily bear
with it, when our Princes were under his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and guided by the Measures that he gave
them, yet now Prince and People are both equally
odious to him. If we have any Regard either to
our Selves, our Families or Posterities, to our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or our Country, to the present or the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Generations, we must now unite our whole
Strength, and turn our whole Forces against those
Enemies of Humane Nature, who wheresoever
they come, turn the richest Soil to a barren Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness;
and after they have gratified their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges
with unheard-of and studied Cruelties, their
Appetites with the most defiling Rapes, their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice
with the most exquisite Plunder, finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all that cannot be any way serviceable to
themselves. These are things which we cannot
easily believe; since Warrs formerly were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by Rules, and a Faith that was held sacred
even in the hottest Rages of War; but those Beasts
of Prey gave themselves no Restraints; or if they
themselves were capable of any, yet the terrible
Orders that are given them, of executing whole
Nations and Provinces, leave no room for any
Remnant of Humanity that is perhaps not
quite extinguished in them. Men of gentle and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65712:13"/>
peaceful Natures cannot form to themselves a just
Idea of the Miseries which must follow on our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
under such an Enemy.</p>
            <p>If while things are in this State, every one
will look on, and fancy, That this lies on the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and not on himself; if Men will neither
with their Persons nor their Purses contribute
what is in them to our preservation, if some
small Distastes do alienate them from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and from the publick; this gives us yet a
more terrible Prospect than the Jews had. For tho'
they had whetted their Spirits one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beyond Imagination, yet all agreed in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Romans. And when they attacked them,
they went all to their common Defence: But if
we will throw up all, because we cannot carry eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
things, if because we cannot revenge or subdue
those who differ from us, or because some things
do not please us, we come to have softer Thoughts of
our Enemies, and imagine that we can make Terms
with them and trust them; and if some fancy that
by reason of some Managements they have been in,
their Fate will be milder, not to say better, this is
an Error, that they will not perhaps ever see, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not like to outlive it. To such as can
so deceive themselves, I will only tell what the
Pope's Legate, that commanded the Army that
besieged <hi>Beziers,</hi> said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When, as they were going to
storm the Town,<note place="margin">Ranaldus's continuation of <hi>Baronius.</hi>
               </note> some told him, That there were
many good Catholicks among the Hereticks or <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenses,</hi>
and therefore askt orders what to do
with them. <hi>Kill all,</hi> said he, <hi>God knows them that
are his:</hi> being resolved that what share soever,
they might have in the Mercies of God, they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65712:14"/>
should have none of his. Under the Price of
our being both Papists and Slaves, there can
be no Redemption; and when they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
with so much unrelenting and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Fury whole Countries of their own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not sparing neither Churches nor Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
for which even savage Nations have had
some regard; What can Hereticks expect from
him who has vowed their destruction, and reckons
the Persecution that he has set on foot against them,
the top of his <hi>Glory?</hi> If after all this, Men will
not apprehend their danger, or will fancy that they
can secure themselves by acting in a different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
let these see if among the Protestants of
<hi>France,</hi> those that shewed at all times the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive
Compliances with all the Inclinations of the
Court, found when the fatal Decree was given,
any other Distinction than that a very few of
them were suffered to go out of the Kingdom;
and even this Cruelty was to be magnified, as
an extraordinary Favour and Gratitude of the
Court. We are now upon the greatest Crisis
of any Age: The greatest that is in our History,
and much the greatest that has been since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
began: If we can get through this War with
Success and Victory, we have before us the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Prospect that any Nation can have in view; of
securing our own Peace and Happiness, our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and our Government: And of being the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that shall give a Deliverance to <hi>Europe,</hi> and
a Security to the Procestant Religion, and of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Bounds to the great <hi>Abaddon</hi> the <hi>Destroyer</hi>
and Enemy to Mankind. If we value either our
own Happiness or the Honour of our Country,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65712:14"/>
will we think it a heavy thing to lessen our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
to cut off from Prodigality and Luxury, and
reduce our selves to a narrow compass; that we
may preserve the whole, when a few Years fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
may support a chargeable War; and bring
us into Habits that may make the succeeding Peace
prove a double Blessing to us? Can we think
any thing is too much when our Religion, our
Countrey, our Lives and Liberties are the price
that is to be fought for: And when the Issue of
the present Scene and War must be our Being,
either the happiest or the miserablest Nation upon
Earth.</p>
            <p>The Fate of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was terrible, and
ought to be set before us: They were besieged
by the Turks, whom they knew to be a most
cruel Enemy, and a most barbarous Master.
They could hope for nothing if they fell into their
Hands, but to become a prey to them: Yet they
would neither assist their unfortunate Emperor
with their persons nor their Purses. He had none
to preserve both him and them, but some hired
Troops, who for want of pay were mutinying
upon all occasions, he coined all his own plate,
even the sacred Vessels were not spared; He
went in person among the rich Citizens, and
with Tears in his Eyes, desired their Assistance
towards the preservation of the Empire and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but by a fatal stupidity, they either did not
see their danger, or took no care to prevent it:
For though there was an inconceivable treasure
found among them in the sack of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
yet they seemed to take care to preserve it all
for the Enemy; and would imploy none of it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65712:15"/>
for their own defence. This was such a degree
of Infatuation, that if the Historian who relates
it, had not lived in the time, and had his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
from Eyewitnesses, we could scarce
give credit to it. God grant such Examples
may make us wise. The poor Emperor resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not to outlive his Glory, and so in a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
sally that he made he fell before the Enemy,
who after that found so faint a Resistance, that
they quickly carried the place and became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of all that Wealth, which its former owners
had so carefully preserved for them.</p>
            <p>If we had a sute for our whole Estate with
one that spared no cost, we should not out of
an ill timed Frugality let him carry it, rather
than be at the charge of maintaining our Right;
we should rather save it, out of every thing else,
than let all go. Our Enemy leaves his subjects
as well as his Enemies nothing: so he finds spoil
enough to support his Ambition and Lust of
Conquest. When then all is struck at, all must
concur in so just and so necessary a cause.</p>
            <p>But I come in the last place to those things
that belong to our mutual Peace, among our selves:
The common Peace and Safety will be ill preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
if we are <hi>biting and devouring one another;</hi>
we shall need no Enemy to destroy us,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 15.</note> if this
continues, <hi>for we shall be consumed one of another.</hi> We
have nothing so conspicuous in the History of the
Destruction of the <hi>Iews,</hi> as their cruel intestine
Feuds and Wars, which made them an easie Prey
to the <hi>Romans.</hi> They were at first divided into
three great Sects, that of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who were
plain Atheists and Libertines, that denied the being
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65712:15"/>
of Spirits, and a future state, and that by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
could lie under no Restraints from their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
They struck in to <hi>Herod,</hi> and afterwards
fell under so general an <hi>Odium,</hi> that they grew more
inconsiderable towards the end of that State. The
second Sect was that of the <hi>Essens,</hi> who were men of
excellent Morals, and of a sublime Piety, who retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their ancient Simplicity, they retired from the
World, lived in common, at work, and in constant
Devotion: These did likewise disappear, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
they became Christians, to which their holy
Dispositions and their strict Lives did so much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them, that it is scarce possible to think that
Men of such Tempers could resist such a Religion.
But the third Sect, that swallowed all the rest up,
was that of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> of whom so much is said
in the Gospels, that it is not necessary to enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Character: They were a sort of People
that under an outward appearance of great strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
were the falsest, the violentest, the cruellest, and
the most revengeful; they were the least moral,
and the most hypocritical and diabolical Sect that
ever was: These, by the appearance of Exactness
and of Zeal, had so <hi>possessed</hi> themselves of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and the Affections of the People, that they
could turn them which way they pleased; but
among them there were Subdivisions. The <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi>
were those who from the Example and the
Rewards of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> came to think, that when
Magistrates were too slack in punishing Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
private persons might do it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had
been one of these, and as such, he not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
the Church from House to House, but
having got a company of Men of the same fury
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65712:16"/>
to follow him, he went to persecute them even
to strange Cities. Now, towards the end of the
History of the <hi>Iews,</hi> we see this became a matter
of meer Rage; and Companies assuming this name,
got together, and run about executing whatsoever
their own <hi>Fury</hi> inspired them with, as a revenge
of Sin, in the Name of God. These first murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all the <hi>Romans</hi> every where, and so engaged
themselves in a War with them, that required
either a most mighty resistance, or that must in
conclusion end in their own utter ruin: They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
murdered all that inclined or moved at any time
to treat with the <hi>Romans.</hi> But men of this sort
seldom agree long together: So these were soon
subdivided into those who were headed by <hi>Eleazar,</hi>
who were the Masters of the Inner Courts of the
Temple; and those who were headed by <hi>Iohn,</hi>
that possessed themselves of the Outer Courts:
And when those within opened the Gates at the
Feast of the <hi>Passover,</hi> that so the People might
come in and offer their Lambs, some of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s
party went in and killed <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and so he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Master of the whole Temple. But this was
not all: for there was another party among them
that were called the <hi>Robbers,</hi> that did the same
thing that the Zealots did, for it is scarce possible
to think they could do worse: But it seems they
did not cover it with the pretence of Zeal for the
Law, and so were the more honest Robbers of the
two; who owned that they <hi>robbed</hi> for <hi>robbing</hi> sake.
These were at first commanded by <hi>Minahem</hi> the
Son of <hi>Iudas</hi> of <hi>Galilee;</hi> but he being killed by
<hi>Eleazar</hi>'s means, they were after that headed by
one <hi>Simon,</hi> who being called into <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> drove
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65712:16"/>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> out of the City, and had many Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with him and his <hi>Zealots,</hi> in one of which
they burnt the common store of Provisions, which
if preserved, would have served to maintain a long
Siege. Thus were they fighting with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
when <hi>Titus</hi> came before them with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that consisted only of four Legions, besides
Auxiliaries: a small force against so vast a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Men, of an enraged Courage, and a City
of such extent and defence. In this Extremity
it was plain, that they must either treat and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
or unite and resist vigorously: There was
but one thing that was both desperate and foolish,
to perish within their Walls by Hunger, and to
be destroying one another as oft as the Enemy
gave them leisure to go about it: And this was
precisely the course they took. If any spake of
treating with the <hi>Romans,</hi> he was presently the
Object of the common fury; yet they did not
sally out upon them till it was too late.</p>
            <p>From the 14. of <hi>April</hi> that <hi>Titus</hi> sate down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, the account of those that died by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
was kept by <hi>Mannoeus,</hi> who had the charge
of carrying out the dead Bodies to the 1st. of <hi>Iuly,</hi>
and it swelled up to an hundred and fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
and eight hundred: This was besides those
who were carried out by their Friends. After
that he fled to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and those who were
appointed still to take care of the Dead, told that
the number was grown up to Six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
And thus the greatest, and once the best,
but then the worst City in the World, perished
in so terrible a manner, that the History of it
would pass for a melancholy aggravating of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65712:17"/>
beyond the possibilities of truth, if he that
wrote it had not been an Eye-witness, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of so true a judgment, of so much probity, and
so full of affection to his Country, that there is
no reason to suspect the Relation that he has made
of it; which as it is by much the saddest piece of
History, so it is that which can never be enough
read; for it will alwaies leave a very good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon the Reader's mind.</p>
            <p>But this is not to be read meerly as a signal
Transaction that pass'd 1600 years ago, but as a
standing Monument of the severity of the Justice
of God against an Impenitent and Rebellious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and <hi>if these things were done in the green tree,
what shall be done in the dry?</hi> If the Seed of
<hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> were so used, why should
others hope to escape, if they become guilty of the
like Ingratitude? And since the immediate cause
of their ruin was that mutual fury that transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them into the most extravagant Excesses, and
which blinded them in all they did, and made
them neglect the most obvious and certain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
for their preservation, either in the way of
treaty or of defence; what a melancholly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
does this set before us, who have such a
mighty Enemy to deal with, that all our Heads,
Hands, and Purses united against him, will find
work enough, and yet are reviving with the
old and once extinguished names our old animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
to so high a degree, that this puts every
thing to a stand, even the Thoughts of good and
wise men. It was once hoped, that all past Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
had been forgot, especially in those who in a
time of danger, when they saw the tendency of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65712:17"/>
some steps into which they had been engaged,
made so generous a resistance, and stand against
the common Enemy, which shewed the sincerity
of their Hearts, and their firmness to the Religion
and Laws of <hi>England;</hi> and that former Errors had
been the effects of a too great easiness to believe
and to think well of others. But when this City
was so much united in so noble a resistance to
barefac'd Popery and Tyranny; who could
have thought that upon such a Deliverance
as we have been blest with, we should not have
improved it much further than we have done, for
those great ends for which we have reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that God has sent it to us. If some years
agoe, when all were under those fears, out of which
God has brought us, and were joyned together in
that struggle for our most holy Faith, out of which
if we had not all escaped, we must all have perished
together; any one had said, that either differences
of Opinion, or any former Errours would have
made us fall out again, if God should again have
blest us with the return of Religion, and of our
Laws in their Ancient force; he would have been
looked on by all as a Melancholy Presager of evil
things. But we are now just in this, or rather in
a worse condition: a violent Aversion, and a mortal
Jealousie appears on all hands, we fancy we are not
safe from one another; and by our fancying it, we
render our selves indeed unsafe. If this should have
come upon us after we had got entirely out of all
our difficulties and dangers, it had been bad enough;
but in a state of calm we could have better born
such Concussions, and should have had time to look
out for proper Remedies; but while we are yet in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65712:18"/>
so much danger, while Union is so necessary to all
our common preservation, that we should now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil
our selves, and the Publick; as it is just that very
madness which our Enemies would wish to us, so it
carries in it so terrible a Character of God's casting
us off, and giving us up to the Counsels of our own
hearts, that if by the earnest Prayers of those who
mourn in secret, and the hearty endeavours of such
as are fitted for such healing work, we cannot cure
this Disease, we must give our selves for a lost Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If Attempts this way prove unsuccessful,
then every man must prepare himself the best he
can, to bear the share that he himself must expect
in the Miseries of his Countrey. And if through
our Passions and Follies, God does deliver us up into
the hands of our Implacable Enemies, as we must
expect that they will take care, that we shall never
be in a condition to shake off the yoke again: so to
every one whose passions have transported him into
those Excesses which are like to be fatal to us, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of this will be one of the most insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Ingredients in his misery, that he had procured
it to himself. <hi>O Israel thou hast destroyed thy self!</hi>
will carry in it a terrible sound, when the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will be so just. Suffer me then in the words
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 5.</note> to say, <hi>Is there not a wise man among
you? I speak this to your reproach.</hi> Is every Man so
soured with the leaven of a Party, that he cannot
see himself, or make others observe the tendency of
all this? Were the wrongs done so great that they
cannot be forgiven? Are the differences so wide
that they cannot be healed? Is there no Balm in
<hi>Gilead,</hi> and is there no Physician there? Have we
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65712:18"/>
no sense of all that God has done for us? Will we
quite defeat, and disappoint it? Have we no sense of
God's forgiving us our many hainous sins? Have
we no regard to the great Example of the Holy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
who here mourned over that City, which was
in a few days to cry out against him, <hi>Crucifie, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie?</hi>
And do we not consider the unexampled gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness
of him whom God has set over us, whom
perhaps some may think merciful to an excess: But
it is a happy state for Subjects when this is one of
their chief Complaints. He to whom under GOD
we owe our present peace and happiness, does both
by his own practice, and his advices recommend this
temper so earnestly to us, that if none of all these
Considerations of Religion, Reason, Example and
Interest can work upon us, we must conclude, that
this is one of the heavy Judgments of God, which
is already poured out upon us; that is not only
heavy in it self, but is chiefly heavy on this account,
because it will most certainly draw a great many
heavier ones than it self after it. If our differences
were of so strange a nature, that no Expedient could
be offered that were proper to compose them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in such a case should remain, but to cry out,
<hi>The wound of the Daughter of my People is greater than
that it can be healed.</hi> But as it is a strange reproach to
a Physician, if one should die under his hand, of
one of the slightest evils that could possibly affect
the Body of Man; so to see the Peace of a City, or
of a Nation disturbed, not to say lost, upon such
matters, must prove either that the Humours are
very bad, or that the Wound has been but slightly
cured, by those who perhaps instead of using Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to allay the heat, do rather inflame it. Upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65712:19"/>
the whole matter, the right way of procuring fit
Remedies to all our evils,<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 40.</note> is <hi>to search and try our ways
and to turn again unto the Lord, to lift up our hearts
with our hands unto God in the heavens, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that we have transgressed and rebelled: and that
hither to God has not pardoned: That he covered us with
his anger, and himself with a cloud: That Fear and a
snare is come upon us, that therefore our eye should run
down without any intermission, till God look down and
behold from heaven:<note place="margin">V. 56, 57, 58.</note> And then we might see that God
would hear our voice, and not hide his ears from our
cry; that he would draw near to us in those days that we
call upon him, and say unto us, fear not: That he would
plead our cause and redeem our life who sees the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of our Enemies, and all their imaginations against
us;<note place="margin">v. 64. 66.</note> and would render them a recompence according to the
works of their hands, and persecute and destroy them in
his anger from under the heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remains little to be said to the last particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
that I proposed, which is that which is implied
in this period, that is in the form of a wish, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
supposition: <hi>If thou hadst known,</hi> and so it is
broken off abruptly, without adding any words,
that import what should have followed upon it.
But this is a figure natural enough to every Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
without going to search for a Hebraism:
There being something in this way of expression,
that is so tender and languishing that it exceeds any
thing that could have come to give it a more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
conclusion. In a word, it imports that all that is
great or good, all that they could wish for or desire,
either with relation to the publick, or in their own
particular, all the Preservations and Deliverances,
all the Felicities and Prosperity of a Nation, might
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65712:19"/>
be justly expected from so happy a discovery, and
such a change in their tempers; as first to find <hi>out,
and</hi> know, and then to seek after <hi>the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to their peace.</hi> They could not indeed have
continued to have been as they had been formerly
the People of God, with the exclusion of all others;
but they would still have retained this priviledge
that the Gospel was to be offered <hi>to the</hi> Jew <hi>first,
and then to the</hi> Gentiles; so that they would have
been always the First-born of the Churches of God:
and if they had received the Messias, they might
have continued to be the head of all Nations. But
it was otherwise appointed in the wise and holy
Councils of God, for reasons which we do not now
perfectly understand. This only we know, that God's
rejecting them was <hi>the calling of the</hi> Gentiles.<note place="margin">Rom; 11.</note> And
indeed the tenderness of the expression here used,
seems to import this that there was no hope of this
supposition's proving real: so the words that follow
may be considered as the closing the period. I need
not here enlarge to set before you the blessings that
without flattering our selves too much, we may
reasonably expect upon our setting our selves to find
out, and to pursue <hi>the things that belong to our peace:</hi>
They are both so visible in the Natural Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of things, and so eminent and great in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that I cannot imagine how any one that loves
his Religion or Countrey, himself, or his Posterity,
can think of them without feeling in himself all
the emotions of joy, and all the fervency of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
upon so glorious and so amiable a prospect,
<hi>that we shall be blessed in the City and blessed in the
Country,<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 3, 7, 9, 10, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

shall establish us to be a holy people to himself; so that
all the people of the earth shall see that we are called by
the name of the Lord, and shall be afraid of us, and
that we shall lend to many Nations, and not borrow.</hi> I
will not offer to you the dismal reverse of all this,
in the Curses that are denounced upon a people that
shall not hearken to the Voice of the Lord, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his Commandments to do them. I hope
for better things from you, and such as accompany
