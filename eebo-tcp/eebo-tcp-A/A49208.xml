            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHereas we are informed by our Deare Aunt the Queene of England, of the diſtreſſed eſtate of the King her Husband, forced upon him by a rebellious party of his meaneſt Subjects under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Baron of FAIRFAX, who is likewiſe countenanced by a ſmall handfull of the baſeſt of the people crept into the lower Houſe of Parliament, but not being a tenth part thereof, the worthieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either impriſoned, or baniſhed by the tyranny of the Army, have deſigne to proceed againſt the perſon and life of their King, which is an action ſo deteſtable, and ſo deſtructive to the Nationall Rights of Princes and people, who are like to be inſlaved thereby, and to know no law but that of the Sword; that we conceive our ſelf obliged by the lawes of God and man, in the duty of a Chriſtian, as well as the rights of a King, either to redeem from bondage the injured perſon of our neighbour King and Uncle, or to revenge all outrages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, or hereafter which may happen to be done thereupon.</p>
            <p>Therefore with the advice of our deare Mother the Queen Regent, and Counſell, we do publiſh and declare our deteſtation of all ſuch proceedings, and vow in the preſence of God and his holy Angels, a full revenge upon all actors or abettors of this odious deſigne, to the utter extirpation of them, their wives and children, out of all parts of Chriſtendome wherein our power or intereſt can prevaile, if they proceed to this damnable fact, we conceiving it fit, to root out from humane ſociety ſuch a ſpurious and viperous generation of men. And we do therefore prohibit all ſuch perſons, their wives and children to come into any of our Dominions, unleſſe they will be proceeded againſt as traitors to God and Nations.</p>
            <p>And we do likewiſe invite all our neighbour Kings, Princes and States in amity with Us, or with whom we have any difference, to an honourable peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we may all joyne in Gods Cauſe and our owne, to revenge theſe hypocriticall proceedings of inraged Villains, who (we heare) take the cauſe of God for their pretence to deſtroy his ordinance.</p>
            <p>And we deſire all our neighbour Kings, Princes and States to make the ſame Proclamation we have done, againſt any of theſe or their adherents, from coming into their Territories; that when by Gods juſtice, and ours and others endeavours, they ſhall be chaſed out of their native countrey, they may wander like vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds in heatheniſh places, with the odious brands of Regicides upon them: and further to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that if the like madneſſe took any of their armies, they would not implore our helps, as now this afflicted Queen and Aunt of ours hath occaſion to do theirs, againſt perſons who are now twice Rebells: Firſt, againſt their lawfull Soveraigne, upon pretence of reformation of Government; and now againſt the very men and authority which raiſed them for that pretended occaſion; wherein Gods juſtice is ſo apparent, that we are confident he will bleſſe this work intended by us, and which we hope will be ſeconded by all perſons of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Juſtice both at home and abroad, to help to ſuppreſſe theſe rebells againſt their raiſers; who yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon the ſucceſſe of their armes to erect their owne baſe thoughts and fortunes, above the limits of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or reaſon, to ſuppreſſe that Authority which God hath ſet over them.</p>
