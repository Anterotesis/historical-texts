            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>What was the reason of this sudden alteration?
It was not <hi>reason:</hi> but <hi>passion;</hi> because the <hi>Niniuites</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Elias</hi> did <hi>not well,</hi> to call for death for a little

               <p>THis clause is plainely interpreted <hi>vers. 26. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi>
had a reuelation by the holy Ghost, that
hee should not see death, till he had seene Christ.
<hi>This was Gods word,</hi> and this was a <hi>certaine</hi> word;
but yet looke into this word, and for one <hi>certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
you shall finde two <hi>vncertainties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, the Text saith, <hi>Expectabat consolationem:</hi>
hee expected the consolation of Israel. To <hi>see</hi>
Christ, he was <hi>certaine:</hi> but <hi>when</hi> to see Christ, hee
was <hi>vncertaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, he was to liue, <hi>till</hi> Christ came, that was
<hi>certaine;</hi> but <hi>whether</hi> hee should <hi>then immediately</hi>
die, that also was <hi>vncertaine. Nicephorus</hi> saith, he
dyed <hi>presently</hi> at that instant. But the Scriptures
and <hi>Apostolicall</hi> Fathers are altogether silent;
therefore it is dangerous to be confident. <hi>Simeon
therefore had an absolute certainty of life, no absolute
certainty of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No more had <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> they were <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi>
to die, and <hi>neuer</hi> to enter into <hi>Canaan:</hi> but
they were not <hi>certaine,</hi> when they should see <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>
from the Mount, and so die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hezekiah</hi> that was <hi>promised</hi> fifteene yeeres life,
must so be vnderstood, as he was <hi>threatned</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
death; both <hi>condicionall and limited to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of second causes,</hi> which haue not in them an
<hi>absolute necessitie,</hi> but a <hi>voluble contingencie.</hi> God
did not make <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> body <hi>impassible</hi> against <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb facs="tcp:7188:14"/>
violence;</hi> nor <hi>incorruptible</hi> against <hi>internall
corruption:</hi> But thus saith the Lord: <hi>I haue heard
thy prayer, I haue seene thy teares, I will adde fifteene
yeares of strength.</hi> I will <hi>repaire</hi> the <hi>defects</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and extend them to a <hi>possibilitie</hi> of fifteene
yeeres, with an <hi>implicite condition</hi> of thy <hi>repentance,</hi>
and so of thy liues <hi>continuance.</hi> Yea, to goe a little
farther, that which Christ said of the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is applyed by the Fathers to the day of
death, that neither the <hi>Angels,</hi> nor Christ the <hi>Lord</hi>
of Angels, doth know that day and houre, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
Hee knoweth
that, saith <hi>Nazian,</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> but as <hi>Man,</hi> he doth not
know it. I am not ignorant, that the <hi>Schoole</hi> and
some of the Fathers doe interpret those wordes in
another sense; But <hi>Bernard, Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>
doe concurre with <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> affirming that
Christ, as man did not know it: <hi>not because he could
not, but because he would not. Ne <note n="a" place="margin">Bernard.</note> eam ignorantiam
feramus molestius, quaecum Christo &amp; Angelis, nobis
est communis:</hi> that wee may beare that ignorance
patiently, which is common to vs with Christ and
his Angels. Many men (I confesse) are sicke of
lingring consumptions, the infallible harbingers
of death; and yet they are not certaine of the
moment of their consumption.</p>
               <p>Many at the beginning of their sicknesse, feele
in their hearts, a presage of their death: and yet
they languish in hope, and know not the certaine
houre of their dissolution.</p>
               <p>The generall rule remayneth, that <hi>Simeon</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7188:14"/>
knew not, that <hi>no man</hi> knoweth the <hi>place,</hi> the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
the <hi>moment</hi> of death.</p>
               <p>First, not the <hi>place:</hi> and it is no great matter,
since <hi>Rachel</hi> dyed in the <hi>high-way,</hi> aswell as <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
in the <hi>streets:</hi> since <hi>Iosias</hi> and <hi>Achab</hi> both dyed
in the <hi>field:</hi> since <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> dyed both in
one <hi>battell,</hi> and their carkases were hung vp as
Trophees of a bloudie Victorie in a <hi>barbarous
Citie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will you heare a Philosophicall comfort? <hi>Earth,</hi>
you know, is the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter,</hi> &amp; heauen is the worlds <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference.</hi>
If any man shall draw a <hi>Circle</hi> with his
pen, with a <hi>point</hi> in the middest of the <hi>Circle,</hi> the
Circle is equally distant from all points of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
vnto the point of the Center. <hi>There is therefore,
from all parts of the point and Center of the earth, an
equall distance to the Circle and Circumference of
Heauen.</hi> What matter therfore though the bodies
of the Martyrs were intombed in the entrailes of

<hi>Rhodanus?</hi> though their carkases were made a prey
to the fowles of heauen? What glorie was it to

how carefully and loyally your peace, against all

vouchsafed to instruct me in the <hi>Alphabet</hi> and

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7188:20"/>
I beseech you giue way a little to my affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
thankfulnesse, if I interueyne our <hi>Earles ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi>
with his <hi>wiues vertues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her first lifes blood was deriued from ancient
<hi>Gentrie,</hi> but her <hi>seruice</hi> in <hi>Court,</hi> her <hi>excellence</hi> of <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
and <hi>graces</hi> of <hi>mind, transplanted</hi> her into the stock
of more ancient Nobilitie.</p>
               <p>Our Earle found her the Widow of that great
Earle, <hi>Edward</hi> of Derby, found, and a while kept
her, a most <hi>beloued, louing, gracious, compassionate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,</hi>
and <hi>noble</hi> Lady: whose vntimely death
<hi>without issue,</hi> deuided a paire of <hi>honourable Turtles,</hi>
deuided their <hi>bodies,</hi> but not their <hi>soules;</hi> 34. yeeres
hee spent, as a <hi>mourner</hi> of her Funerals; deuided
their <hi>bodies,</hi> but not their <hi>loues;</hi> for though her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
lyes buryed at great <hi>Gaddesden,</hi> which <hi>necessitie
did enforce;</hi> yet all that <hi>Iacob</hi> could doe for <hi>Rachel,</hi>
he hath done for her, in ioyning her piller vpon his
owne sepulchre, making one indiuiduall monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for them both, in this Chappell; to testifie
to all the world that happy vnion, of which, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life nor death could make a disiunction.</p>
               <p>Such was his Lady, such was their loue.</p>
               <p>I would to God the <hi>discontentments</hi> of great
<hi>Lords and Ladies</hi> did not make it <hi>remarkeable.</hi> What
a shame is it, when our <hi>honourable mariages</hi> are
like that of <hi>Pompey with Iulia,</hi> of <hi>Anthony with Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia:</hi>
which are not made to vnite <hi>hearts,</hi> but <hi>hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi>
nor to ioyne <hi>affections,</hi> but <hi>factions:</hi> the issue
being as <hi>fatall,</hi> as the beginning was <hi>vnfaithfull?</hi>
But I had rather powre foorth <hi>prayers</hi> to God for
<pb facs="tcp:7188:21"/>
                  <hi>reformation;</hi> then spend <hi>vnregarded words</hi> of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let it suffice, that <hi>they</hi> there lye <hi>together</hi> in <hi>one</hi>
graue, of whom you cannot iudge, <hi>whether their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
were greater, or their loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing in a family, is the entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of seruants: which this Honourable person
knew best to chuse, because himselfe had been a
seruant. Though hee was borne of a most Noble
family, yet being a <hi>younger brother,</hi> (as <hi>the vniust,</hi> yet
<hi>vsuall custome of our Country is,</hi>) hee was compelled
by <hi>necessitie</hi> to serue in a Noble Familie: but after,
was preferred to the seruice of the late <hi>Queene of
happy memory.</hi> In both which he gained such expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,
that hee knew with <hi>Iacob</hi> how to reforme
his houshold: that no <hi>Idolatrous Baalite,</hi> no <hi>Idle-bellied
Cretian,</hi> no <hi>prophane Esau,</hi> no <hi>Ruffian Lamech,</hi>
no <hi>blasphemous Rabsache,</hi> no <hi>inordinate persen,</hi>
should by his <hi>will</hi> and knowledge, shrowd their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
vices vnder his Honourable vertues.

                  <hi>Aristippus,</hi>
who replied to a <hi>wonderer</hi> of a great <hi>traine of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants:
At plures muscas in culina:</hi> hee had not (saith
the Philosopher) so many <hi>seruants</hi> in his <hi>Hall,</hi> as he
had <hi>flies</hi> in his <hi>Kitchen.</hi> Seruants, who are fed like
<hi>great horses,</hi> onely for <hi>pompe</hi> and <hi>shew,</hi> are vsually <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious
and vnprofitable</hi> creatures. But those ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
whom hee <hi>intertained,</hi> those he <hi>trusted,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
<hi>it a French lightnesse,</hi> to intertaine a few
<hi>Pyes,</hi> and to change them as often as their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7188:21"/>
His ancient seruants, <hi>fit</hi> for a setled and an Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
house, <hi>sufficient</hi> for their number, and <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie</hi>
for their qualities; whereof some had
continued with him tenne yeeres, some twentie,
some thirtie, some fortie yeeres, those (according
to the meanes and measure of his estate) he rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at his death. Others, who serued him lesse
time, hee <hi>honoured</hi> either with a Ring of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
or comforted with halfe a yeeres wages for
their present maintenance. <hi>Generally</hi> he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them all to his Honourable Brother, that
howsoeuer they had lost a <hi>louing Lord,</hi> yet they
might find a <hi>Noble Master.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was a great part of his care at death, that his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
might be prouided for the meanes of life.</p>
               <p>I must not forget to conclude this point, with
the remembrance of another Legacy. Our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Earle did so remember his owne <hi>seruants,</hi> as he
did <hi>not</hi> forget Gods poore <hi>seruants:</hi> 50. pounds
he allotted by his will, to be distributed to Christs
brethren, to feed them, to clothe them, or in such
manner to comfort them, as their necessitie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and his brothers iudgement should order; that
as his soule was to bee comforted by the blood of
the <hi>Lambe:</hi> So, (as <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh) the loynes of the
poore might bee warmed with the fleece of his
<hi>sheepe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third point was the care of his estate,
which, as he publisheth in the <hi>Record of his Will and
Testament,</hi> he found almost ruinated, by the vaine
prodigalitie of <hi>Richard Earle of Kent.</hi> He knowing
<pb facs="tcp:7188:22"/>
therefore that <hi>Honour without meanes,</hi> is but a <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
burden,</hi> but the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Babel,</hi> the <hi>seminary of
confusion,</hi> he made a <hi>carefull frugalitie, the fuell of
his continuall hospitalitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great things by prouidence are attained, by prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
ruinated.</p>
               <p>You reade in the 15. of <hi>Luke</hi> of a <hi>prodigall sonne,</hi>
in the 16. of <hi>Luke,</hi> of a <hi>prodigall seruant:</hi> and <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie</hi>
brought <hi>both</hi> to beggery; the one with <hi>shame</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 15. 21.</note> came crying to his father; the other said, he was
<hi>driuen</hi> to<note n="b" place="margin">Luke 16. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>cozen</hi> his Master.</p>
               <p>Our honourable Earle therefore professeth in
his Will and Testament, that hee did not build
yonder Monument of stone for any vaine glory,
but as an Emblem to <hi>his posteritie,</hi> that their house
was <hi>ruinated</hi> by <hi>Richards prodigalitie,</hi> was <hi>restored</hi>
by <hi>Henries frugalitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such a curse followeth Absolon:</p>
               <p>Such a blessing followeth Ioseph.</p>
               <p>I call not euill good, I apparell not vice with the
Liuery of vertue. It was not <hi>basenesse,</hi> but <hi>proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
that laid the <hi>foundation;</hi> It was not <hi>oppression,</hi>
but <hi>time,</hi> that finished this building.</p>
               <p>You of this <hi>Parish</hi> know his <hi>voluntary</hi> contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to publike charges, whereof hee was freed by
Law. You of the Country know his <hi>perpetual</hi> hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping,
his <hi>relieuing</hi> of the poore, his <hi>feasting</hi> of
<hi>whole</hi> Townes at publike times, and solemnities.</p>
               <p>He knew full well, that a man may better cheape keepe
a constant and good house, then an vnconstant and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
harlot. In one word, Iacob prouided, and God prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb facs="tcp:7188:22"/>
                  <hi>But all these</hi> Heroicall, politicall, Oeconomicall
<hi>vertues are common vnto</hi> Traian, <hi>aswell as to a
Christian; all these things</hi> without grace, <hi>are not a</hi>
naturall, <hi>but a</hi> painted <hi>floure of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Except wee can find that he was as good a <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of God,</hi> as he was a <hi>Lord of men; omnis humana
Iustitia simil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Iustice (saith <hi>Lactantius</hi>) is but like a body
without a head; Is but the <hi>shadow,</hi> Is not the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs leaue him therefore as a <hi>Lord of men,</hi> and
consider him as a seruant of God.</p>
               <p>To expresse which attribute of a seruant, I find
two other words in the Text; the <hi>first</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>life:</hi> the <hi>second</hi> doth afford <hi>securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
in <hi>death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>Secundum verbum,</hi> according to <hi>Gods word in
liuing. 2. In pace,</hi> according to <hi>Gods will</hi> in <hi>dying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>life</hi> was <hi>secundum verbum,</hi> according to
Gods word, whether you consider his <hi>publike</hi> or his
<hi>priuate</hi> deuotions.</p>
               <p>His <hi>publike deuotions</hi> in fauouring and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Lords Prophets; like another <hi>Obadiah,</hi> he
fed <hi>them at his owne</hi> Table, hee vsed them with all
respect of their calling, he accounted them as the
Angels of Gods Church, and not as many <hi>politikes</hi>
doe, the basest of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Priests: Hee knew that
those that serued at Gods Altar, were not to bee
accounted as the <hi>retriment</hi> of the people. It
being an infallible consequence, that <hi>he who
despiseth Gods Ministers, doth contemne God in
<pb facs="tcp:7188:23"/>
his Ministers.</hi> If Christ be Christ, Christians will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Ambassadours of Christ.</p>
               <p>Atheisme is the mother, and contempt the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of prophanenesse.</p>
               <p>Next, his deuotion appeared in the doctrine and
discipline of truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against <hi>superstitious Idolatrie, and
ignorant noueltie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me record what I know, what he knew and
professed, (<hi>For although Iuy cling about the Oake, yet
is not the fruit of the Oake.</hi>) It cannot be denied, but
that <hi>some</hi> that had more <hi>zeale</hi> then <hi>knowledge,</hi> and
I feare (notwithstanding their frequent lip-labor)
more <hi>knowledge,</hi> then <hi>conscience, (I am sure more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
then obedience</hi>) shrowded themselues vnder
his protection, which through the <hi>defect of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
hee could not auoid, being compelled to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
such, as the partialitie of some about him
did commend vnto him; but for his owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he euer desired men of <hi>religion,</hi> void of <hi>osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi>
men of <hi>conscience,</hi> free from <hi>faction:</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the established <hi>Apostolicall discipline of the
Church of England, to be preferred before the lunacies,
and Fansies of Consistorian confusion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, his publike frequenting of Gods <hi>Temple,</hi>
(not his <hi>priuate Chappell</hi>) where (through want of
hearing) he was rather a <hi>Spectator,</hi> then an <hi>Actor,</hi>
gaue so good example to his houshold, to the In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>habitants
of the Towne and Country, as the good
that came thereby, did testifie to all the world,
how much it concernes euery great person, to
bee <hi>either a Michael, a Leader of Angels, or a
<pb facs="tcp:7188:23"/>
Lucifer, a Captaine of Deuils:</hi> I expresse my selfe.
Truth and Religion seeke no <hi>corners,</hi> no <hi>woods,</hi> no
<hi>chambers,</hi> no <hi>places,</hi> no <hi>persons,</hi> of darkenesse. God
doth giue that blessing to the publike Temple,
that he doth not giue to a priuate Chappell; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
they are <hi>Chappels of ease, more for their ease,
then their honor.</hi> As though we cannot adore the
God of heauen, except we be <hi>attended like Beronice,
with pomp</hi> on earth. If at the day of Iudgement we
shall all stand in the Valley of <hi>Iehosaphat:</hi> If the
foure and twentie Elders doe cast their Crownes
at the feet of the Lambe: I beseech you, must we
(for flate) contemne the publique assemblies?
Our most <hi>noble,</hi> most <hi>humble</hi> Earle, knew, that in
respect of our sinnes, the bloud of the <hi>poore Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
Sonne</hi> doth equally wash the soule of a <hi>Lazar,</hi>
aswell as of <hi>Caesar.</hi> Therefore as there is but <hi>one
common saluation,</hi> so there ought to bee a <hi>common,</hi>
and <hi>a publique,</hi> and <hi>a ioynt</hi> humble <hi>Inuocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>priuate deuotions</hi> were performed without a
Trumpet: I will not make them more by <hi>Arte,</hi>
then they were in <hi>heart. Pray</hi> hee did: pray hee did
<hi>euery morning and euening;</hi> pray hee did in his <hi>owne
person;</hi> pray he did in his <hi>Chamber,</hi> without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>witnesse,</hi> then the witnesse of a broken spirit to
God. Some one (necessarily) <hi>saw, and obserued him,</hi>
(as <hi>Daniel</hi> was obserued to pray towards Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,)
but he did not pray <hi>to bee seene,</hi> though hee
<hi>was seene</hi> when he prayed. As Christ went vp to
Mount Oliuet, which mountaine he chose for <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarinesse,</hi>
not for <hi>greatnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7188:24"/>
His <hi>prayers ended,</hi> his <hi>bodie refreshed,</hi> his <hi>minde
quieted,</hi> the rest of the day he spent in <hi>reading the
Scriptures</hi> and the Commentaries of holy writers,
in reuoluing <hi>the Histories of Church and State.</hi> In few
words, the vanities of the world did not draw him
from a <hi>constant and continuall</hi> course of Pietie. So
that the latter part of his life, was like the daily
reuolution of the Sunne, in <hi>a seasonable and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
and a certaine Spheare of Vertues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His death was the last <hi>Sceane</hi> of all his labours,<note place="margin">Death.</note>
which (as I was informed) was like to <hi>Simeons</hi> in
the comfortable peace of his soule. Great is Gods
mercie, when the earthly Tabernacle of the bodie
doth so sensibly decay, that wee <hi>finde</hi> our deaths,
before we <hi>feele</hi> it. His <hi>body,</hi> you know, was <hi>ploughed
with furrowes of age,</hi> which caused him to keepe
his <hi>bed,</hi> before any (but himselfe) saw his <hi>period.</hi>
A Phisitian was sent for, <hi>whose presence is mixed
with feare and comfort;</hi> but to him, who was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
his Phisitian brought neither <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort,</hi> nor <hi>feare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He reioyced, that hee trusted not with <hi>Asa</hi> in
his <hi>Phisitian,</hi> but in his <hi>God.</hi> And according to that
confidence, hee <hi>exhorted</hi> his affectionate brother,
with words of grace and pietie; He put his house
in <hi>order</hi> like <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and with great <hi>patience expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi>
the howre of his dissolution. His <hi>want of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
excluded all possibilitie of <hi>externall comfort,</hi>
but he felt a <hi>Comforter within,</hi> which none can tell,
but he that enioyes him; yet the inward ioy of his
saluation, sent forth (as <hi>Austen</hi> speakes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians)
<hi>quasdam eiaculationes:</hi> certaine winged
<pb facs="tcp:7188:24"/>
darts vnto Heauen. His <hi>heart</hi> was like a <hi>Furnace,</hi>
and his <hi>words</hi> (though short) were as so many
<hi>sparkes</hi> of deuotion. I haue a relation from his
Chaplaine, to whom in priuate hee disclosed the
burden of his conscience.</p>
               <p>His bodie being <hi>decayed</hi> with <hi>age,</hi> and <hi>wearied</hi>
with <hi>sicknesse,</hi> our <hi>Aduersarie,</hi> who is a <hi>seeking Lion,</hi>
sought to deuoure him: <hi>His priuate confession shewed
the particularitie of his temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Deuill presents to his melancholy fancie,
the power of Witches; tempting him to <hi>conceiue,</hi>
that for his <hi>sinnes,</hi> God had <hi>forsaken him,</hi> and giuen
him ouer to the malice of <hi>Sorcerers;</hi> striuing to
make him thinke that this his weaknesse and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
was hot a <hi>defect</hi> of nature, but an <hi>effect</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
Thus was our good Earle winnowed; but he
that prayed for<note n="*" place="margin">Peter.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> prayed for <hi>Henrie,</hi> that
his <hi>faith might not faile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And faile it did not;</hi> Gods <hi>Spirit</hi> brought vnto
his <hi>memory,</hi> the mercie of God to <hi>Dauid repenting,</hi>
the power of God against <hi>Balaams cursing;</hi> and now
he found the <hi>comfortable fruit</hi> of <hi>reading</hi> the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
in them he found <hi>Balme</hi> of <hi>Gilea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> comfort
and consolation against the power of <hi>hell and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
Hee concluded an <hi>humble confession,</hi> with a
<hi>firme resolution:</hi> that God would bee <hi>mercifull</hi> (as to
<hi>Dauid,</hi>) that God would bee <hi>powerfull</hi> (against <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>)
that <hi>God would not forsake him, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his sinnes; that hee would not forsake God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

               </p>
               <p>If any man d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>troubled with doubting.</hi> When a man considers
his owne <hi>demerits, then hee iustly doubts of mercy:</hi>
when a man <hi>considers Christ his merits, hee firmely
trusts in Gods mercy.</hi> As in a battaile, all the time
of the <hi>skirmishing,</hi> there is <hi>doubt:</hi> But when the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
<hi>flyes</hi> and is put to <hi>rout,</hi> then there is <hi>no doubt.</hi>
So in the <hi>soule,</hi> all the while the Deuill <hi>flings</hi> his
fiery darts, there is <hi>doubt:</hi> but when hee is <hi>conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
by the sword of the Spirit, then there is <hi>no
doubt.</hi> As therefore you reade of the Poole of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesda;</hi>
First, the Poole was <hi>troubled,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> the
sick were <hi>healed:</hi> so this noble <hi>Earle</hi> first felt a <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
spirit,</hi> to <hi>trie him,</hi> and then the <hi>ioy</hi> of <hi>the holy
Spirit</hi> to <hi>comfort him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And surely <hi>it was the holy Spirit;</hi> for it neuer
left him, after it had found him. The last words
that euer man heard him speake, were <hi>three Amens</hi>
to his Chapleins prayers, <hi>concluding his life</hi> as the
holy Ghost doth the Scripture, <hi>Amen, Reuel.</hi> 22. 20.
Amen, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22. 21. As Christ <hi>concluded his Crosse,
Amen, This day shalt thou bee with mee in Paradise,
Luke</hi> 23. 43. To which Paradise, I doubt not, but
his blessed soule is gone <hi>before.</hi> God grant that ours
may follow <hi>after;</hi> That we may all depart in <hi>peace,</hi>
to the fruition of eternall happinesse.</p>
               <trailer>Amen, Amen, Amen.</trailer>
