            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Great Number both of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which have, within the course of a few years, been most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately and elegantly turn'd into <hi>English,</hi> by Persons of great Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and of, perhaps, as flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Styles, as any Age has produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; may justly seem to claim a piece of the same Nature, with
<pb facs="tcp:66025:3"/>
that I here present the Reader with; which, though it has been attempted by several in <hi>Latin,</hi> has not, to my knowledge, been done by any one pen in <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, till that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of excellent Versions had made way for it, it would have been of no use; for those who could have then read the Authors, are here mentioned, would not have need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Translation of this; and the rest would onely have been <hi>Tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized</hi> by it; and a mighty thirst have been raised without any pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of satisfying it, in any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable degree.</p>
            <p>But now that so many of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Historians have been taught so rarely well to speak our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which is now too become so copious, elegant and smooth, that
<pb facs="tcp:66025:3"/>
it is capable of expressing all the Treasures and Beauties, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Idioms and Varieties of those too Rich and valued Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; What greater service can be done to our <hi>English</hi> Nobility and Gentry, than to shew them how to Marshal these Authours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their proper places in Ranks and Files, to extend or enlarge the History of any Age or People, as any Man's Leisure or Curiosity leads or invites him?</p>
            <p>And as to those Historians which have not yet been published in our Language, the very representing them here, with all their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and rare perfections, may perhaps work upon some of our Great Men, and invite them to give incouragement to Learned Men to Translate them too; till
<pb facs="tcp:66025:4"/>
our Language become as Rich in Books, as it is in Words and polite Expressions; and as this will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease at once their Knowledge and Delight, so it will contribute to their glories too; not onely in this Age and Nation, but in following times and Neighbour Countries, who will value our Tongue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Pieces they find in it. At least I am persuaded, nothing else has perpetuated to this day the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues: now no Nation speaks either of them, but the great variety of Excellent Books, which were Originally writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in, or Translated into those two Tongues. And I am confident the <hi>French</hi> Tongue is at this day as much esteem'd for the sake of their delicate Versions, as for any of their Original Pieces,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66025:4"/>
But I must not expect this will please all. There is a sort of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose Gentlemen in the World, who, having at the price of many a sore Lashment, possess'd themselves of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues, would now very fain Monopolize all the Learning in them: and except the Gentry and Nobility will run through all those difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and miseries they have done, though very much against their wills many times; as having been driven, or dragged up into the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol,</hi> by a sort of Men, who were as terrible to them, as the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing <hi>Roman Generals</hi> were to the poor Chain'd-Captives, which follow'd their Chariots, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and inevitable death.</p>
            <p>But however, being now as I said in possession, they are very
<pb facs="tcp:66025:5"/>
much displeased to see their preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treasures made cheap, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the eyes of all that can read <hi>English.</hi> And whoever contributes to this invasion of their Privileges (as they think them) is sure to be branded as an Enemy to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Learned Men, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer of the <hi>Muses</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> and a thousand fine things, to the scorn of the vulgar. And some of them are wonderfully afraid, that so soon as ever all the good Books are Translated (which I dare as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them will not be in their times) then there will be no farther use of, or esteem for the Learned Tongues, and so consequently all Learning will perish out of the World.</p>
            <p>But this is a mere fancy; for when all is done that can, Men of extraordinary industry and curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:66025:5"/>
will be desirous to see these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours in their Originals, and will be as little satisfied with the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Translations of the <hi>Roman</hi> Authours, as they are with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> Authours, which have not been the less, but the more read (for being Translated in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin)</hi> even in their proper Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
            <p>And, in the interim, Men of less industry or leisure, who could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have reaped any advantage from them in the Learned Tongues, will, by the means of these Versions, be improved; and as they become wiser and better, the affairs of our Countrey (which are for the most part managed by such Men) will become more happy and prosperous to our great and lasting good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66025:6"/>
And accordingly there hath ever been some Men, who have been so far from valuing themselves, upon the reputation of having many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, that they have generously and industriously put into the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages of their own Countries, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they found excellent and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in any other. And by this means was the <hi>Graecian</hi> Library rais'd out of the <hi>Phoenician, Assyrian</hi> and <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> out of the <hi>Graecian;</hi> and some of our Modern Scholars of these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages, have, in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, enriched their several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries with the Spoils of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens;</hi> but none more than the <hi>French,</hi> who, ever since the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the First (who was a great encourager of Learning and Learned Men) have employed
<pb facs="tcp:66025:6"/>
some or others of their best Pens to go through with this laborious, and (as one styles it) inglorious drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery; till they have by degrees at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to so great a perfection in it, that they have equall'd, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps sometimes excell'd their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, to their great glory.</p>
            <p>Having premised this short Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for Versions in general, I come in the next place to that Piece I here present the Reader with, which I take to be the best, in its kind, that ever was yet Printed; because the Authour has not onely furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Reader with an exact Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Method of Reading all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Historians, whether Civil or Ecclesiastical, in their proper order and places (which has, in part, been done by <hi>Vossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Lipsius,</hi> and some others)
<pb facs="tcp:66025:7"/>
but has also taken a great deal of pains to invite the Reader to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruse them too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> By giving short, but very beautifull Schemes, or Planes of all their several Works; which is the most winning way of engaging a Reader to undertake that task; such Planes being a kind of Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or Landsckapes, to shew the Reader what pleasing objects he may expect to meet with, if he have the courage to proceed. And if the Reader please but to peruse the 8th <hi>Section</hi> of the First Part, where he gives an account of <hi>Herodotus</hi> his History; he will then be able to judge for himself, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my word for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By informing his Reader where every History begins, and where it ends; which has been
<pb facs="tcp:66025:7"/>
done by few others, and by no body with more exactness. This too is a great invitation to a Reader, to know, in what Age of the World he is, and how far his Authour will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him, before he reads one word in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He has acquainted his Reader with how much remains now extant, and how much is lost of any History, which hath not come down perfect and intire to us, as very few of the more Ancient have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He has told us, when each Historian Wrote, or Lived; of what Countrey and Interest he was; which are things of great use, as to the advancing, or abating the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of any Writer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He has represented the Styles, Characters, Virtues and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:66025:8"/>
of each Historian, which are notices of the greatest use and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to a Reader that is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of the greatest pleasure and delight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> He has not given us his own thoughts in all these onely, but has taken the pains to search out and transcribe the very Words and Censures of the more ancient and latter Criticks of greatest fame and reputation, which was a Work of great labour and difficulty.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole matter, I am very much tempted to alter his Title, and to call this Piece, <hi>The History of the</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Latin <hi>Historians.</hi> For so the first part of it does well deserve to be call'd.</p>
            <p>The Addition in the middle of the First Part, concerning the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
<pb facs="tcp:66025:8"/>
of particular Nations and Places, is a thing of great use and Learning, though not equal to the exact care and diligence of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, as any Man that shall please to compare them together will soon find; which I suppose was owing rather to the Authour's great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be short, than his want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry or ability. In the <hi>Latin</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py there is onely the two first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Name, <hi>N. H.</hi> but I <note place="margin">History of <hi>Oxford,</hi> lib. 2. p. 98.</note> have been informed by a person of great worth, who knew him, that his Name was <hi>Nicholas Horseman,</hi> and therefore I have put it so, that his Memory may be preserved to Posterity.</p>
            <p>The Authour of this Piece has not onely taken great care and pains to direct and encourage his Reader to that noble and usefull study of
<pb facs="tcp:66025:9"/>
History, by the best Method that ever was proposed in his First Part: but he hath also in the Second and Third Parts, taken an equal pains to fit and direct him how to reap the utmost advantage from his Readings, both as to himself and as to others. Which two Parts, as he has handled them, are not less usefull, or delightfull than the First; but they being both very short, the Reader may much better satisfie himself by a perusal of the whole, or of the Contents onely of the Chapters, than be here trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a long discourse of mine upon them.</p>
            <p>As this Piece was thus drawn with a mighty care and labour, so it hath accordingly been valued in the World; for besides the first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of it, which preceded this
<pb facs="tcp:66025:9"/>
latter Twelve years, as he tells us in his Preliminary Oration; this has been Printed since the year 1637, three times; and if I be not misinformed, four times; and yet now it is a scarce Book.</p>
            <p>Nor is this any great wonder, if we consider, that besides the usefulness of the Subject, the great Learning, Candor, Modesty and Industry of the Authour, he spent almost two whole years in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this small Discourse, after a whole Impression of it had been sold off. For his Preliminary Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made the 17th day of <hi>October, 1635.</hi> and his Epistle Dedicatory to the University of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> bears date the first of <hi>July, 1637.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should have been much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed if I could have given the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:66025:10"/>
the Life of this Great Man, but that I cannot doe it, having never been written by any Man, to my knowledge; and he being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unknown to me, any otherwise than by this his Learned Work, which I have had a great esteem for ever since I first read it; which made me the willinger to run through the labour of Translating it, which was no very easie task; and also of adding some things to it, as necessity required.</p>
            <p>In the History of the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Oxford, p. lib. 2. p. 98.</hi> and in other places, I find this short account given of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Degoreus Whear</hi> was born at <hi>Jacobstow,</hi> in the County of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall.</hi> He was call'd from <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Hall</hi> to <hi>Exon</hi> College, in the same University, to be made a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb facs="tcp:66025:10"/>
there, where he was afterwards examiner of the Lads, in the year <hi>MDCII.</hi> at which time he was Master of Arts. About six years after, desiring to Travel, he took his leave of the College; and, (spending some time beyond the Seas) returned into <hi>England</hi> with the Lord <hi>Chandois;</hi> and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with him in great esteem: that Lord dying, he came with his Wife to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and took some Chambers in <hi>Glocester Hall,</hi> which were not then employed for want of Students. There he was not long before he became acquainted with one Mr. <hi>Thomas Allen;</hi> By whose Recommendation, the famous Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> (designing then to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a Reader of History in that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity) chose him the first Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66025:11"/>
To this purpose this great Man gave to the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> out of the Manor of <hi>Bexley,</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> One hundred and Forty pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> And after a certain term of years the Rents of that whole Manor; which when it comes, it will be worth about Four hundred pounds a year. The Charter of this noble Grant bears date the Fifth of <hi>March, 1621.</hi> The 17th of <hi>May, 1622,</hi> this Donation was publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Convocation-House of that University. And the 16th of <hi>October</hi> of the same year, our Learned Authour was declared Reader by the Founder. And <hi>Brian Twyn,</hi> a very Learned Man, was declared his Successour, if he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived him, being then a Batchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of Divinity; but he died before Mr. <hi>Wheare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66025:11"/>
It was a great Honour to him to be chosen by so great a Man as Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> and preferred before <hi>Brian Twyn.</hi> And he soon made it appear, that he well deserved the Honour that was done him, in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ingenuius Oration which he made in <hi>Latin</hi> in the Schools, when he entered upon his Lectureship; which is Printed in the end of this Piece: in which he complains much, <hi>That his long disuse of the</hi> Latin <hi>Tongue, during his Sixteen years absence from the University, had rendred him unable, or at least very unapt to Discourse, or Write that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:</hi> But though his Modesty extorted this Complaint from him, the Reader will scarce find it in this Oration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66025:12"/>
In the year 1625, he first pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished this Piece in <hi>Latin,</hi> which he reviewed and enlarged in the years 1635, and 1636; and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed again in the year 1637.</p>
            <p>He was admitted Principal of <hi>Glocester-Hall</hi> in the same Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, the fourth of <hi>April 1626,</hi> where he continued till the day of his death, which was the first of <hi>August 1647,</hi> and he was buried in the Chapel of that House. So many years he managed this place; whereas his Successour, Mr. <hi>Robert Waring,</hi> was chosen the 11th of <hi>August</hi> of that year, and turn'd out for his Loyalty the 14th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1648,</hi> by the Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Visitors.</p>
            <p>Besides this Piece, he writ in the year 1623, a Funeral Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, containing an Historical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb facs="tcp:66025:12"/>
of the Life and Death of Mr. <hi>Camden;</hi> and a Dedication of the Statue of that Great Man, in the History Schools there. And also a Collection of Gratulatory E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles: Which three last Pieces were Printed together at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the year 1628. The Character given him by the Authour of the said History of <hi>Oxford</hi> is this; <hi>Vir fuit Urbanus, doctus &amp; Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us: He was a Pleasant, Learned and Pious Man.</hi> To which give me leave to add, that he was a Man of great Industry and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, as the Reader will see when he comes to read this Piece.</p>
            <p>Nor is his Gratitude to the great <hi>Camden</hi> less vsible, both in his Oration which he made, when he entered upon the Reader's place; and also in the two others which
<pb facs="tcp:66025:13"/>
were made and published after the death of his Benefactor.</p>
            <p>Though it was his great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to live in times of Trouble and Confusion, yet God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to let him depart in peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the execrable Murther of his Sovereign, and before the Rebels had purged that University of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was Loyal and Constant. For though the Parliament had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted this the <hi>June</hi> before he died, yet they could not then ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their Ill Designs.</p>
            <p>As to the Version, I have done the best I could to make it true and smooth, which was not so easie as at first I thought it would have been; by reason of the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Quotations out of other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours; many of which are so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short and dark in their expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:66025:13"/>
that I could scarce, if at all, tell how to find English words, that would represent their notions true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And besides this, it is unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie for a Man to accommodate himself so suddenly to such a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Styles, as here occur in almost every Page; and therefore it is not improbable I may have committed many errours and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes.</p>
            <p>I have also presumed, in some places, to make Additions too, when I thought it necessary, but then I have given the Reader notice of them; that he may know what is Added, and what is the Authours.</p>

In the first there are many things that are pleasant and usefull to be known; but in the second there are more things which are necessary: Upon which the Discourse is concluded, with an Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a diligent reading of the Church-history.</item>

               <p>The occasion of Repeating these Lectures and Examples. The Scope publick Advantage, yet not to be rashly published.

            </argument>
            <p>IT is now about ten years and some Months, if my Calculation deceive me not (Most Honourable Academicks,) since I made some Discourses in this very place, in the Presence of a great Assembly, concerning the <hi>Order and Method of Reading Histories.</hi> Whereupon some of my then Hearers prevail'd upon me by their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity so far as to Publish from the Press, and bring into the Light, those Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, such as they were. Of late some of my Learned Friends, have solicited me with the same vigour and irresistible Earnestness, that I would bring these Lectures the second time to the <hi>Anvil,</hi> and still insist, urge and inculcate these reasons for it, that they may surmount my reluctance. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Impression is many years since sold off, and yet most eagerly sought after by many, that therefore a new Edition would be very acceptable, and very usefull too, to the younger Students without doubt. And there are some also of my present Hearers, whom I have heard wish, very passionately, that I would <hi>reade</hi> again upon that Subject, and afterwards (if I thought fit,) Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate my <hi>Lectures</hi> to the Learned, and publish them to the World. At length I yielded to the desires of both, as far as I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66025:26"/>
am Capable: though at the same time I cannot with the same facility satisfie my own private humour by it, and much less my Judgment. My design then is (with the favourable assistence of God,) to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to you my Hearers, those former Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, with Additions and Amendments in some places, in my next <hi>Lectures:</hi> and that so carefully improved and Corrected, as none of you may justly retort upon me the Satyrist's Proverb,

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And yet whilst I well Consider you, what if I should onely repeat my former thoughts? for how few of you is there who now fill those Seats, who have either from my Mouth heard, or in Print read those former Discourses? it may be in truth none, or two or three at most, and even those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, as I conjecture, who have ever heard of them are not much more Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. In short, I will grant they were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore Printed, so I may obtain that at some times, in some places, they were in some Esteem and read by some with some advantage, and not thought unworthy of a light Commendation: why then should I be blam'd for repeating and retouching the same Readings to my New Hearers, who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66025:27"/>
are for the most part now to begin the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Histories? to these they will seem new, though onely renew'd to others. Nor would I have you think I enter upon a new and unheard attempt by doing thus, <hi>I have the Example of Good men on my side, by</hi>

               <hi>which I am encouraged so to doe. It was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and commendable Custome heretofore, which is still in use, that in the delivery of Arts besides the daily Lectures, the Tutours should repeat some things over again more Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately, by which the minds of their Pupils being as it were invigorated, they might be the more inticed to a diligent pursuit of their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral professions. Thus in the days of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> Franciscus à Victoria <hi>had his reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Theological Lectures;</hi> Melchior Canus, <hi>his Scholar also had his, both Divines of great Note amongst the</hi> Roman Catholicks; <hi>and of later times</hi> Henningus Arnisaeus, <hi>a famous Philosopher and Physician, published his repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Politick Lectures,</hi> and many other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men of different Professions have put out their repeated <hi>Lectures.</hi> But what need is there of so many Examples? when the thing is able to justifie it self, and affords me a ready defence? for whatever does once please, if we conceive that there was any solid Cause for it, we may well hope the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of it will not be unacceptable. <hi>That which is Good is Gratefull the second and third time,</hi> was a Greek Proverb. And the <hi>Venusian</hi> tells us of a Good Poem,</p>

            <p n="3">3. But that which <hi>Horace</hi> promised would be the effect of an excellent Poem is too Great, and Glorious for me to aspire to, and even above my wishes. For I am not so like <hi>Suffenus</hi> the bad but conceited Poet, or so self affected, that I should ever think these my rude and unpolish'd <hi>Lectures</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of so strange a Fate. My Design and Scope has indeed ever been to seek the good, and promote the advantage of my <hi>Hearers,</hi> and yet I have not onely here in this Publick place, but every where sought carefully what might please you too, though to wise minds these two are inseparable, for it is but just and reasonable, that what does profit should please; and therefore whilst I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these things seriously with my self, I see no cause to fear this my slight Work should be less gratefull or acceptable to my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Nor am I unwilling to comply with the desires of my Friends, (those I mean who as I said before desired these Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be reprinted, as having faln in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of very few men,) and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because they so confidently aver, that it will be a very great Help to the Youth of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66025:28"/>
the University, and to all other lovers of History. Whose Judgments though I do not totally suspect, as bribed by their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to me, yet I think seriously and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with my self, (with <hi>Pliny Secundus</hi> an excellent Writer,) <hi>that it is a great thing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Epist. 1. 7. Ep. 17.</note> 
               <hi>to put a Discourse into the hands of Men, nor can I</hi> (saith he) <hi>perswade my self, that what a man desires should please</hi> all and always, <hi>ought not to be often reviewed and by many.</hi> And for these causes, Gentlemen, I have not long since resolved diligently and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately to revise those my former Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and having so re-examin'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged them, then to recite them so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to my Hearers, and yet not then Publish them to the Learned World, till they had been well approved by many and Learned men, who have great knowledge in History, as not wholly unworthy of the Light.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I think it is not unknown to many, and I have observed it too often my self; that too great a Self-love and Confidence, have insensibly stoln upon the <hi>Wits</hi> of this and former Ages. May I advise you (young men) to shun this, as the worst of Pests, let us banish it from us, and think meanly of our selves. Let us measure our selves and our Performances by our own <hi>Foot</hi> and <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,</hi> and not believe any thing that is Great of our selves, beyond what we are truly Conscious of to our selves. <hi>Modesty, Modesty</hi> is it which becomes every Age, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66025:28"/>
leads all that follow her in the Streight and right <hi>Path</hi> to solid <hi>Glory,</hi> without it we are Hurl'd down precipices, and instead of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Honour become the Scorn of Men, and instead of a good Fame, we return loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Ignominy and Contempt; but to return, have you ever read or heard that of the <hi>Comedian, He that can revere his own mind, knows how to begin Safely,</hi> or as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Mimogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi.</note> reade it, to <hi>attempt Safely?</hi> I doubt not but you have heard it: Believe this Speech which deserves Credit, and is an Admonition of the Greatest Value, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in War, and yet not of more use in the dangers of the Camp, than in the Hazards which attend the <hi>Gown</hi> and the <hi>School.</hi>

This was well understood by <hi>Pliny,</hi> whom I just now named, and therefore not trusting much to his own Judgment, he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often or rather always, desired the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Council of others, when ever he Composed any thing which he intended to Publish, but hear him in his own words; <hi>Being to recite a small Oration which I intend</hi>

            <p n="7">7. But it may be objected, this will look like Ostentation to many, and an Affectation of a little vain, empty Glory ambitiously Courted. I say it is nothing less, for it is rather Modesty, prudence, an humble esteem of a Man's self, and the avoiding boldness and boasting as detestable. For therefore does a man recite his Writings, or submit them to be read by others, that he may know their Judgments, and hear the truth concerning them, that if any thing has slip'd him he may amend it, if any thing be obscure, he may illustrate and clear it, if any thing is not true he may Correct it, according to the old Proverb, <hi>Recitations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi>

               <hi>Amendments.</hi> Will you therefore a while hear <hi>Pliny</hi> Discoursing at once the Causes and Advantages of Publick recitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his Epistle to <hi>Ariston,</hi> lib. 5. Ep. 3. <hi>I follow (saith he) these reasons for reciting: First, He that recites reflects somewhat more sharply upon his own Writings, out of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Hearers. Secondly, That he may determine what he doubts of by their Advice and Counsell; And though he is not inform'd what they think of him, yet he may observe it by their Countenances, their Eyes, their Nods, their Whispers or Murmurs, their Silence, which by Notices that are not obscure discover Judgment from affection, and so it may happen
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66025:30"/>
if it be heeded, that I have changed some things upon the judgment of some who were present, who said nothing to me.</hi> You see <hi>(my Hearers)</hi> what were <hi>Pliny's</hi> causes for Reciting: and it is very apparent thereby, that there were many Advantages gain'd by it. Now if the Writers of our age would for the same reasons reduce it into use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, who could blame them for it? who could accuse them of an Ambitious vanity? what if <hi>M. Cato's</hi> cavillers should infest him? who will allow nothing to be well done or said by others, which they will not presume to dress over again? what if they will not fear to spend freely their Conjectures? and to guess as readily as injuriously at the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of another? Wise men will without concern suffer their malignant rash con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures to run by them, and pleasantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in the rewards of a good Conscience. And I will freely grant, that this usage has been taken up heretofore by some Ambitious Vainglorious men, who made the Noise of the Rabble the <hi>End</hi> of their Actions, and courted the Popular breath, Hunting after the great but indiscreet Acclamations of the <hi>Little Folk;</hi> O Wisly! <hi>Euge!</hi> Well! Pleasantly! and such like silly Exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by their Recitations. O silly, vain, foolish Fellows! O the miserable Slaves of Glory! I hope our times afford men of more Wit, and of more Generous minds, they know that it is the least part of a wise Man's care to Sail by the Card of Fame and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66025:30"/>
Opinion. <hi>A wise man</hi> (saith a Noble Greek Authour,) <hi>neither Speaks nor Acts any thing for repute onely.</hi> Our desire then is, that he that recites any thing, or commits it to another to be perused, should propose to himself a better End, and a more Noble Design; that is, that whatever he intends to publish for the Advancement of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, might by these means come forth the more Correct, polite and probable, for this was the end of the Great <hi>Secundus, not that he might hear his Works Applauded while he recited them, but that they might then be commended when they came to be read.</hi> And yet (nor will I dissemble it,) the Reply of the Satyrist does not displease us;</p>

Some other may possibly object it is in vain to delay us with a Recitation, if at last you intend to publish these Discourses, which every man may then reade with more Attention in the Quietness of retirement: but I reply (as I have said before,) that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them that they may come out the more perfect and Correct: And I have also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Reason for it, and that of no less moment. The Rules of all Arts and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines, as all grant, are more happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still'd by the mouth of a <hi>Teacher</hi> than they are drawn out of Books: and why then should not we conceive the same may hold true concerning the Rules of Reading Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story? I am sure this was the opinion of the often cited <hi>Pliny,</hi> for writing to his Nephew, thus he tells him, <hi>You will say I have several not less Elegant discourses which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Ep. 3.</note> 
               <hi>I can reade; it may be so: But then you will never want an opportunity to reade them, but you may for hearing; besides as it is commonly said, the living Voice does most affect us, for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66025:31"/>
though what a man reads he attends more Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to, yet those things we hear sink deeper, which the very Pronunciation, Countenance, Habit, and Carriage or Behaviour of the Speaker, Stamps and Prints upon our minds.</hi> And St. <hi>Hierome</hi> in an Epistle to <hi>Paulina,</hi> saith, <hi>The living Voice hath</hi> somewhat <hi>of a secret energy or power, and transfusing it self from the mouth of the Authour penetrates the Ears of the Disciple with a stronger sound.</hi> And therefore <hi>Fabius Quintilianus,</hi> one of the greatest Masters of the Art of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, gives this as a rule for the forming a good Oratour. <hi>Let the Master</hi> (saith he) <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 2.</note>

Things standing thus <hi>(my Hearers,)</hi> what hinderance remains that we may not chearfully prepare ourselves for the designed Work? which having thus bespoke your affections, we will begin forthwith in the next Lecture, and in the mean time lest whilst we are to discourse concerning the <hi>Order and Method of Reading Histories,</hi> we should break the rules of <hi>Method,</hi> if our younger Hearers (for whose sake this Task
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66025:32"/>
is undertaken,) be not told what Histories we mean, we think it now worth our while to premise first the Definition, and then the Division of Histories, and then briefly to explain them, that by this means we may open a more clear passage to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our designed undertaking to its End. The Definition then which we formerly made, and which I will still stand by is this. <hi>History is the Register and Explication of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</note> 
               <hi>affairs, undertaken to the end that the memory of them may be preserved, and so U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversals may be the more evidently Confirm'd, by which we may be instructed how to live well and Happily.</hi> I say first then, that it is <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister and Explication,</hi> because we are to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of it as it may be read, so that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording and explaining are the <hi>Genus,</hi> for the <hi>Object</hi> or matter I put <hi>particular affairs,</hi> that is publick or private Actions worthy of the memory of men. I assign a manifold <hi>End,</hi> that the memory of particular Actions may be preserved, and also that out of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, general Precepts may be deduced, and Confirm'd: and lastly, that by these we may be the more instructed how to live well and happily, for this was the reason why <hi>M. Tully</hi> styl'd History the <hi>Mistress of Life,</hi> and to this relate those excellent words of <hi>Livy</hi> in the Preface to his History. <hi>This is the most Healthfull and Profitable atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of the knowledge of History, that you may Contemplate the instructions of variety of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples united in one illustrious Monument,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66025:33"/>
and from thence take out such things as are use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to thee, or to they Countrey, and that thou mayst wisely consider that what has an ill beginning will have an ill end, and so avoid it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. According to this our Definition, we subjoyn our Divisions, which are not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and exquisite (for such would be of no use here,) but popular and common. I know that History has been divided both by the Ancients and some of the Modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into <hi>Divine,</hi> which treats of God and Divine things; <hi>Natural,</hi> which treats of Naturals and their causes, and <hi>Humane Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> which relates the Actions of Man as living in Society; and our definition has respect onely to the latter; and this again we subdivide into <hi>Political</hi> or Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical History, and again both these into <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Particular</hi> Histories. The <hi>Political</hi> or Civil History is that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the Rise or beginning, Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Increases, Changes and Affairs of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, Common-wealths and Cities. <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi> History is that which principally describes the affairs of the <hi>Church,</hi> though at the same time the Transactions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs and Kingdoms are also inserted. <hi>Universal</hi> either Civil or Ecclesiastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story is that which contains the Actions of all, or at least many and those the most considerable People, Common-wealths or Churches, for many ages; the <hi>Particular</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story is that which comprehends the affairs
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66025:33"/>
of any one People, City or Common-wealth, or of one particular Church. <hi>This our Method</hi> is intended to describe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct <note place="margin">The Scope.</note> and regular way of Reading all these in their due <hi>Order.</hi> There is another divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of History, which offers it self to our Consideration, and is especially worth the observation of Youths, which is taken from the Circumstances and Modes of Relating or Explaining things: as of Histories some are call'd <hi>Chronicles,</hi> which are those that chiefly take notice of the times in which Actions are done; others are call'd <hi>Lives,</hi> which describe the Persons of particular men, and their Actions and Manners; others are call'd <hi>Relations,</hi> or Narratives, whose chief business is to relate faithfully and clearly the memorable Actions of particular men, or any particular affairs of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. As to the first of these heads, all Histories do or at least ought to note the times in which Actions happen, for every Relation is obscure, and like a Fable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Addition of the time in which it falls, and yet all do not observe the same intervals of time, nor keep the same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Relating, and this produces variety of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> from whence has sprung the various denominations of <hi>Annals, Fasts, Ephemerides</hi> or <hi>Diaries, Menologies, Bimestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Trimestrias, Semestrias, Decads</hi> and <hi>Centuries,</hi> of all which we have largely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed in our Preliminaries of History. The Writers of that sort of History we call
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66025:34"/>
Chronicles, are, <hi>Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, Dionysius Halicarnassaeus, Justinus, T. Livius, Sabellicus,</hi> and the like. The Writers of <hi>Lives,</hi> as is said, propose to themselves the representation of the persons of single Men, and (which is worth your reflexion,) to this sort belong mixt Actions, publick, private, domestick and Civil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this Classis are <hi>Suetonius, Plutarch, Cor. Tacitus, Dion Cassius, Aemilius Probus,</hi> and others to be placed. The Writers of Relations or Narratives are Historians, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give full and Continued Accounts of memorable Transactions and affairs, such as <hi>Xenophon's</hi> Expedition of <hi>Cyrus, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustius</hi> his Conspiracy of <hi>Catilin, Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassaeus</hi> his <hi>Embassies,</hi> and the like.

               <p>THat the Reading of History may be attended with the most Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Consequences, and afford the Student a good reward for his labour, three things are insignally necessary. First, That the <hi>Order</hi> he observe be <hi>right</hi> and

Constant, that he be not Confused, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, and desultory in his reading. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That he have a clear and good judgment, that he may with dexterity Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what he reads, and well discern what is to be selected. Thirdly, There ought to be employed a diligent and exact industry that gathering Stores of all sorts, they may be regularly disposed as it were in a Granary; we design therefore to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide this <hi>dissertation</hi> into three general Parts: the first of which shall contain the principal Authours which are to be read, and shall also shew the Order in which they are to be read; the second shall teach who is to be Esteem'd a Competent, well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied reader of History; the third shall shew an Excellent way of gathering the fruits of History, and Explain the order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of disposing them into Cells or Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses.</p>

                  <p>What Series of Histories is to be observed, and how to be ordered; the great intervals of time to be observed; an <hi>Epocha</hi> or <hi>Aera,</hi> what it is, how many there is; the Floods or inundations, in what times they happened; the <hi>Obscure,</hi> and Fabulous intervals or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of time, the <hi>Olympiads</hi> or Historical interval.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS to the first of these, such a chain, Series or Succession of Authours is to be observed in reading, as may exactly imitate the intervals of times, and the great and general Monarchies. The intervals or Periods of times as they relate to History, and the memory of Affairs, as <hi>Censorinus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De Natali die Varro. cap. 21.</note> observes out of <hi>Varro,</hi> are three, the first from the beginning of mankind to the first <hi>Flood,</hi> which, saith he, for the ignorance of the things that were done in it is call'd the Obscure Period; the second is from the first Flood to the first Olympiad, in which because many things are fabulously related, it is call'd the <hi>Mythick</hi> or fabulous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; the third is from the first Olympiad to our times, by which he means the times of the <hi>Caesars,</hi> which is call'd the Historick <hi>Aera,</hi> because the things which have been done in it are contained in true Histories. These great intervals (as you will see,) are divided or distinguished by several <hi>Epochas.</hi> Now an <hi>Epocha</hi> is some illustrious begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

in time from whence we number the following times, and we observe two sorts of <hi>Ephocas,</hi> the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and the <hi>Civil;</hi> the first of these are used in the <hi>Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and Church History, such as are these which follow, from the beginning of the World or the Creation, from the inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Flood, from the building of the tower of <hi>Babel</hi> or the Confusion of Tongues, from the going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the like: these that follow are frequently read in <hi>Prophane Histories</hi> or heathen Authours, from the destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> from the first <hi>Olympiad,</hi> from the Expedition of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> from the passage of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> &amp;c. So in this place of <hi>Censorinus,</hi> from the beginning of mankind or the Creation of the <hi>World</hi> to the <hi>Deluge,</hi> and it is remarkable he styles it the <hi>first</hi> Flood, for History preserves the memory of three great Floods or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luges. The first was the <hi>Universal Deluge</hi> in the time of the Patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> of which <hi>Moses</hi> Writes in the Holy Scriptures, which fell in the year of the <hi>World,</hi> 1656. The <note place="margin">Oros. l. 1. c. 7.</note> Second was that of <hi>Ogyges</hi> in <hi>Achaia,</hi> which destroyed almost all that Province, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it happen'd in the time <hi>Ogyges,</hi> (who was then the Founder and King of <hi>Elusina,)</hi> he gave name to the time and place of it. According to <hi>Orosius,</hi> this fell in the year of the World 2185, in the days of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Jacob.</hi> The third was the <hi>Ducale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Inundation, from him so call'd, <hi>in whose time an inundation (they</hi> are the words of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66025:36"/>
                  <hi>Orosius,) of Waters Consum'd the greatest</hi>

               <p n="2">2. That first Interval which to <hi>Varro</hi> (though a most Learned man) seem'd <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, all Night,</hi> to us Christians is full of Light, and by the Assistence of the Holy Scriptures, more bright than the <hi>Meridian</hi> Sun, and we know it contains 1656 years, the History of which we have delivered by <hi>Moses</hi> in a most brief <hi>Compendium,</hi> in the first six Chapters of <hi>Genesis,</hi> nor is there any thing to be found concerning those things that passed before the Deluge, in all the Monuments of Learning that are Extant, or can be found, but onely here.</p>

The Second Interval from the Deluge to the first <note n="*" place="margin">These Exercises were insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by <hi>Hercules,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived by <hi>Iphitus,</hi> A.

And this is call'd by <hi>Varro,</hi> and not without just cause, the <hi>Mythick</hi> or fabulous interval, because to it belong almost all the Arguments or Subjects of the Poetick Fables. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there are some relations Extant in the Greek Poems and Historians, which are a little more ancient than the first <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad,</hi> such as the <hi>Trojan War,</hi> the <hi>Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Argonauts,</hi> the Histories of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus, Oedipus, Hercules, Theseus</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which for the most part are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by <hi>Ovid</hi> in his <hi>Chronicle;</hi> yet in truth, as <hi>Africanus</hi> saith, all is full of Confusion, and disagreement, and wants the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of years, nor is there any thing worth the taking notice of, in all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monuments, which happened in all that long interval, which passed betwixt the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, and the first <hi>Olympiad</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of CCCC years, and much less is there any thing before the <hi>Trojan</hi> War worthy of Regard. Hence <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Grecians</hi> thus bespeaks them, <hi>You ought to know that nothing is Exactly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Grecians before the first Olympiad,</hi> and Eusebius in his <hi>de praparatione Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelii,</hi> Chapter the 10th, <hi>till the Olympiads, there is nothing of any certainty written by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66025:37"/>
the Grecians, but every thing is confused, nor before that time do they at all agree amongst themselves.</hi> Yet nevertheless, we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have a certain History of all this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous interval,</hi> and (in what relates to the Church) large enough, and very clear, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> those Pen-men of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> wherein many things are intermixt, concerning the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and Kingdoms of the Nations, and their Actions, by the Veracity of which those Accounts we met with in Prophane and fabulous Writers are to be Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

                  <p>The Series and Succession of the great Empires said to be fatal, it is proved there were E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently four; that of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> asserted to be but one Empire.

               </argument>
               <p>NOw since the 4 Great Monarchies or Empires, which (as much as may be known,) are the Greatest, and Successively followed each other, that ever were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, do all fall in that period of times, which contains the Mythick and Historical intervals, which in their times Reigned over the greatest part of the Earth, and under which the far greatest part of what is contain'd in History was transacted. May I propose the Order and Succession of these great Empires? <hi>Aemilius Sura</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known person to me shall doe it for me, who is by <hi>Vellejus Paterculus, Lib. 1. c.</hi> 6. thus represented, The <hi>Assyrians</hi> (saith he,) <hi>were the first of all Nations who attained a general Empire, then the</hi> Medes, <hi>and then the</hi> Persians, <hi>and then the</hi> Macedonians; <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which</hi> Philippus <hi>and</hi> Antiochus, 2 <hi>Kings descended from the</hi> Macedonians, <hi>not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Ruine of</hi> Carthage, <hi>being Conquered, the great Empire or Monarchy, was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66025:39"/>
Authours of Antiquity, do reckon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Medes</hi> for one of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies distinct from the rest; yet we are taught by the Scriptures, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> was but one: Especially when they had taken the Empire from the <hi>Assyrians.</hi> And therefore there was but four illustrious and very great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, which are commonly observed to have been the irreconcilable Enemies of the Ancient Church, which were represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet, in a Vision by four Beasts; to <hi>Zechary,</hi> by 4 Chariots, and to <hi>Nabuchodonosor,</hi> by a vast Image made up of four several sorts of Materials, as the Holy Scriptures testifie: for so the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, and most of the later In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters understand those Prophecies. Omitting then the Modern Expositours, three of the more ancient will be sufficient to prove, that heretofore for many Ages, it has been a received opinion, that the four great Monarchies were designed by the said three Visions. First, <hi>Isidorus Pelusio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, lib. 1.

is the terrible Beast, (which brought with it a vast Amazement,) having Iron Teeth, and being arm'd with Nails of Brass, devouring, grinding, and trampling under foot, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling any Animal, did perspicuously repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the</hi> Roman Empire, <hi>as being compact or made up of all the Nations and Tribes, and in its self furnished with all strength and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Nor did the Propher think it fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press that Principality by one Name, which was to extend the Yoke of its power to all, and at the time of our Lord's Incarnation, was Arrived at an infinite Empire.</hi> Thus far the Pelusiot of the four Beasts; and St. <hi>Hierome</hi> who was a little more ancient than the Pelusiot applies the Vision of <hi>Zechary's</hi> four Chariots to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>In the first Chariot saith hewere</hi> Red Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>Sanguinary and Bloudy, and terrible as Babylonian Cruelty; in the second Chariot were Black Horses, representing the Empire of the</hi> Medes and Persians; <hi>in the third Chariot were</hi> White Horses, <hi>These were the</hi> Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians, <hi>under a King of which Race the Victory of the</hi> Maccabees, <hi>of whom we reade, was; in the fourth Chariot were Horses of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Colours, of great strength; for we know that of the Roman Kings, some were merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Jews, as</hi> Cajus Caesar, Augustus <hi>and</hi> Claudian, <hi>others were Persetutours and terrible,</hi> as <hi>Caligula, Nero</hi> and <hi>Vespatian.</hi> Thus far St. <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Zechary's</hi> Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots.

appeared to <hi>Nabuchodorosor,</hi> signifies the IV Kingdoms. But the Blessed <hi>Sulpitius</hi> does Elegantly unfold and apply it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that the IV Monarchies we have mentioned, were foretold by it. <hi>According to the Interpretation of the Prophet,</hi> (saith he) lib. 2. <hi>The Image which was seen car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the figure of the World, the Head of Gold was the Empire of the</hi> Chaldeans, <hi>for we have been informed that was the first and Richest; the Breast and Armes of Silver foretold the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Kingdom, for</hi> Cyrus <hi>Conquering the</hi> Chaldeans <hi>and</hi> Medes, <hi>transferr'd the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to the</hi> Persians; <hi>in the Belly of Brass was the third portended, and we see the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fulfill'd; for</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Empire from the</hi> Persians, <hi>brought it over to the</hi> Macedonians; <hi>by the Thighs and Legs of Iron the fourth, that is the</hi> Roman <hi>is understood, which was stronger than any of the Monarchies that went before it, but the feet part Iron and part of Potter's-Clay, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell that this Kingdom shall be divided, so as they shall never Unite, which is also come to pass.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We have exprest this somewhat too much at large, which yet we could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the fallacy of <hi>John Bodinus</hi> a very Learned man, having Extorted it from us, who in his Book <hi>de Methodo,</hi> cap. 70. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that the famous division of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the old World into IV Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, was built upon the Modern Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and insipid Conceit of some late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

But from what has been said, it clearly appears to us on the contrary, that these IV great Empires were anciently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and designed; of which two flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed successively in <hi>Asia,</hi> and are therefore call'd the <hi>Asiatick,</hi> and for the same reason the two others are call'd the <hi>European,</hi> which succeeded in <hi>Europe. Vellejus</hi> also, in the place I have cited above, seems to me to prove and confirm both these Names, and several Successions of the great Empires, <hi>in the following times</hi> (saith he,) <hi>the Empire</hi>

to it, made defections till it was torn into several shreds or parcels, the Kings of <hi>Assyria</hi> giving up themselves to Luxury, and thinking of nothing less than Arms and the preservation of their Kingdom; but notwithstanding, from the first Foundation of it to the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when it was transferred to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> there passed almost 1700 years. For though <hi>Justinus,</hi> and <hi>Georgius Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> affirm, the <hi>Assyrians</hi> were Masters of the World, but one thousand and three hundred years, the latter 1060 years, and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> 1400 years.

But <hi>Phul Belochus</hi> and his Posterity first, and then <hi>Merodach Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> and his Progeny, followed the Family of <hi>Ninus,</hi> and kept up that Monarchy in the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Nation to <hi>Baltazar,</hi> who was the last of their Kings, and perished when <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for so <hi>Funccius, Reinerus Reineccius, Viginerius</hi> and others do seem to collect out of Scripture. But <hi>Josephus Scaliger, Dionys. Petavius. Jaco. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus</hi> and others contend against this and endeavour to prove out of <hi>Berosus, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasthenes</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> that the Death of

                  <hi>Baltazar</hi> by the treachery of his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whom he had enraged against him by his ill Nature, happened about seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years before the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus.</hi> So he being slain in the 55th Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, one <hi>Nabonidus</hi> by Nation a <hi>Mede,</hi> (call'd by <hi>Daniel Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> by the common consent of the Conspiratours suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, and he by the chance of War, being overcome by <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> in the XVII year of his Reign and <hi>Babylon</hi> taken, had his Life and the Government of <hi>Carmania</hi> given him, and so the Empire was translated to the <hi>Persians,</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year of the 60 Olympiad and <hi>A.

of, nor improve our selves thereby in the least in Piety; when, if there were any Sense that I may not say prudence in us, we ought rather to begin with what is contain'd in the Holy writings of the Hebrews, for if we search for the Origine of things, we can begin no higher than the Creation of the World, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of man, which is there treated of, if we seek Truth, there is no where so much of it as here, where it is proclaimed by the mouth of the Living God, if we seek grave things, what is more magnificent than these illustrious Monuments, in which the Holy Commands of God, the saving Promises, the certain Oracles, and other helps to our Salvation are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? from whence can we derive more Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Examples of Vertue, or sharper detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Vices, or Actions worthy of memory, than from these Monuments of the Hebrews? in which onely it is apparently discovered, how much mankind has been relieved by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and present Assistence of God Almighty, in the Exercise of true Religion, or in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of it, have been troden down and ruin'd by his Anger.</hi>

Consult <hi>Vossius</hi> his piece of the <hi>Greek Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians.</hi> We cannot deny but some have blamed the <hi>Sicilian</hi> for those five Books that are Extant, which we have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as first to be read, and amongst them <hi>Lodovicus Vivis,</hi> who admires how <hi>Pliny</hi> could say that <hi>Diodorus</hi> was the first of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who left off Trifling, when (saith he,) there is nothing more Idle.

consider the <hi>body</hi> of it in all its parts, in the following method and order of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, if he is pleased to make use of my advice. <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassaeus,</hi> who flourished about 26 years before Christ, <hi>Anno V.

and Murthered; then the Wars betwixt <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi> themselves, who had several sharp Fights to the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of great Armies, till at last Victory smiling upon <hi>Augustus, Antonius</hi> fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Egypt,</hi> having lost his Army, and there Murthered himself, which being the last Book of the Civil Wars, shews also how <hi>Augustus</hi> took in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> became a Monarchy under <hi>Augustus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He gives us also this account of the Authour. <hi>Appianus</hi> was by Birth an <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> and at first a Pleader of Causes at <hi>Rome,</hi> afterwards he was a <hi>Praefect</hi> or Governour of some Provinces under the Emperours; his Style is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and restrain'd, but as far as is possible he is a lover of truth, and an exact relatour of Military Discipline, apt to put Life into the desponding Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, and to appease them when enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and well able to describe and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate any passion. He flourished in the Reigns of <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Adrian;</hi> thus far <hi>Photius</hi> speaks of him.</p>
                  <p>That which prevailed upon me chiefly to insert this Addition in this place, was <hi>Appianus</hi> his History of the Civil Wars in V Books written with great Clearness, Elegance and Accurateness: In which beginning with the <hi>Gracchian</hi> Sedition, about the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws, <hi>A.

through all the various Seditions and Civil Wars of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the Death of <hi>Pompey</hi> the younger, <hi>Anno V. C.</hi> 718. which was but five years before the fatal Battel of <hi>Actium,</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi> his settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Empire, a story that is not writ at large, and intirely by any other but this Authour and <hi>Dion Cassius,</hi> and is one of the best Supplements, that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of the last Books in the end of <hi>Livy,</hi> and one of the best Introductions too, to the History of the <hi>Caesars,</hi> and is one of the most lively Representations that is to be found in any History of the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Common-wealths, and the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that attend great changes in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and so of great use in this our unsetled Age.</p>
                  <p>It is certain this History has lost its end, for <hi>Photius</hi> gives an account that it reached much lower down in his times than it doth now.</p>
                  <p>☞ There is now in the Press an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent History of these times, written Originally in French, but made English, wherein all these Greek and Latine Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians which have related the History of this great change in the <hi>Roman</hi> State, are reduced into one Elegant body. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled the History of the first and second Triumvirate.</hi> Printed for <hi>Charles Brome.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> let the Reader begin with <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus,</hi> a most correct and candid Writer, as <hi>Vopiscus</hi> stiles him. He flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished <note place="margin">In firmo, c. 1.</note> under <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Adrian, Anno Christi,</hi> 127, and was Secretary to <hi>Trajan:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Spartia. <hi>in</hi> Adriano. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> he was an intimate friend to <hi>Pliny Secundus,</hi> and he deserved his esteem, being as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith in a Letter to <hi>Trajan, an honest, sincere</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 10. Ep. 95.</note> 
                  <hi>Learned man.</hi> And thence I conclude that the Testimonies of the later Criticks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him are true, as that of <hi>Ludovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Vivis; Suetonius is the most diligent and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 5. de trad. disc.</note> 
                  <hi>impartial of all the</hi> Greek or Latine <hi>Writers, he seems to me to have written the Lives of the</hi> XII C sars <hi>with great Integrity, because he conceals not the Vices or suspicions of Vices in the very best Princes, nor does he dissemble the Colours of vertue in the worst. Colerus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Epist. de Stud. Poli.</note> doth almost follow <hi>Vivis,</hi> as to the main, and then adds something as to his Style: <hi>His Style</hi> (saith he) <hi>is short and Nervous,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66025:77"/>
and no man has more diligently intermixt the publick Rites, he is most correct and candid, and not obnoxious to any man, for whoever wrote the tempers or humours, and manners of Princes with a greater freedom? Courtiers and Statesmen may from hence reap much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and may also from</hi> Suetonius <hi>at the same time learn to detest flattery.</hi> And with <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus,</hi> the Reader may admit <hi>Tacitus</hi> an Historian of a great and sharp <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> judgment, who wrote of the same times with <hi>Suetonius;</hi> the Criticks say he had a new, concise and sententious way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but as to the use and utility of his History they vary, or it may be rather fight each against other. <hi>Justus Lipsius</hi> the Prince of the Criticks thus expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himself; <hi>an usefull and a great writer,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ep. ad. Ord. Batav.</note> 
                  <hi>and who ought to be in their hands, who have the steering of the Common-wealth and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> and again, <hi>a sharp Writer and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ad <hi>Max.</hi> l. 2. Imp.</note> 
                  <hi>very prudent, and who if ever may be very usefull in the hands of men, in these times and</hi> Scenes <hi>of affairs; he doth not recite the Victories of</hi> Hanibal, <hi>almost fatal to the</hi> Romans, <hi>nor the specious death of</hi> Lucretia, <hi>nor the Prodigies of the foretellers, or the predictions of the</hi> Etruscans, <hi>and the like which are apter to please than instruct the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Let every one in him consider the Courts of Princes, their private Lives, Counsels, Commands, Actions, and from the apparent Similitude that is betwixt those times and ours, let them expect the like Events; you
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66025:78"/>
shall find under Tyranny, Flattery and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Evils too well known in our times, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing simple and sincere, and no true fidelity even amongst Friends; frequent accusations of Treason, the onely fault of those who had no fault; the Destruction of great men in heaps, and a Peace more cruel than any War. I confess the greatest part of his History is full of unpleasant and sorrowfull Accidents, but then let us suppose what was spoken by the dying</hi> Thrasea, <hi>spoken to every one of us;</hi> Young man, consider well, and though I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Gods to avert the <hi>Omen,</hi> yet you are born in those times that require the well fixing your mind by Examples of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>To this may be added his Style, which is by no means sordid or vulgar, but distinguished with frequent and unexpected Sentences, which a man cannot conjecture whence they should be derived, which for their truth and brevity may be compared to</hi> Oracles; <hi>to conclude, he is a wonderfull Writer, and does most seriously doe, what he seems not to make his business at all, for it is not onely a History, but a Garden and Seminary of Precepts. Colerus</hi> follows here the Judgment of <hi>Lipsius,</hi> and thus he writes, <hi>we esteem the Judgment of</hi> Lipsius <hi>as equal to</hi> Tacitus; <hi>thou thinkest, and that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, of the Court and Palaces? as I love thee, look a little seriously in</hi> Tacitus, <hi>into the fortune of Courtiers, and the genius of Princes. Let</hi> Cornelius <hi>be always by thy side, that true Court Companion; nor is there any cause that our Centaurs and Rusticks
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66025:78"/>
should affright thee from him, who pretend that these representations are too ancient, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like our manners and times. I say it is nothing so, there is the same</hi> Play <hi>still upon the Stage, the same vertues, the same vices are Reacted, onely the</hi> Actours <hi>are changed, onely here wants a Learned and a wise</hi> Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. <hi>Isaac Casaubon,</hi> a person admired for his Learning and Vertue, here goes quite against the Judgments of <hi>Lipsius,</hi> and <hi>Colerus,</hi> for where he compares the other Historians with his <hi>Polybius,</hi> he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms of <hi>Tacitus, that if his fortune had not deprived him of a Subject worthy of his facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he might have equall'd any of the most excellent</hi> Greek or Latine <hi>Historians, but such times</hi> (saith he,) <hi>fell under his Pen, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his</hi> Annals; <hi>as there were never any more polluted with vices, or more destitute of, or enraged against all Vertues:</hi> then comparing more particularly the matter of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> together, he concludes thus, <hi>We can easily excuse</hi> Tacitus, <hi>but not those who prefer this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour before all the other Historians, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that he is to be frequently read by States-men, and the onely one from whom Princes, and their Councellours should take rules for the Government of Common-wealths. Now if we would expose the absurdity of this Opinion, it would not be difficult to prove, that those who think so, accuse our present Princes of</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, <hi>or would manifestly teach them the principles of</hi> Tyranny; <hi>for what can be more
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66025:79"/>
pernicious (especially to a young man,) than the reading of those</hi> Annals? <hi>for as good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples when they are frequently in sight im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove a man, without his observation, so ill Examples hurt us, for by little and little they sink into our minds, and have the effect of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, being often read or heard;</hi> but to proceed, our Reader will better appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and more clearly understand both <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> if he has first read <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> whom I mentioned before, <note place="margin">Dion Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</note> and of this opinion <hi>Colerus</hi> is also; <hi>thou wouldest better understand</hi> Suetonius <hi>and</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus, <hi>let then</hi> Dion <hi>lead the way. I would have thee know this, that he is the onely Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, who has given us the famous and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick oration of</hi> Mecoenas <hi>to</hi> Augustus, <hi>which is worth all the rest of the Histories, and he has also the splendid oration of</hi> Agrippa <hi>to him; in other things and relations he hath not wholly escaped the suspicion of false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>

                  <p>A transition to the <hi>British</hi> History, how the Reader ought to prepare himself for the reading of it; in what order he shall go on. <hi>Camden's Britannia,</hi> and <hi>Selden's Analecta</hi> are first to be read, <hi>George Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> his Chronicle, the Compendium of the <hi>British</hi> History.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt that we may not be thought wholly ignorant and negligent of our own History, whilst we search into that of other Nations, it is convenient to give some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>British</hi> Writers, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex it by way of supplement to the former Catalogue, and to point out at the same time in what order they are to be read, for I have no small confidence I shall thereby more oblige our University Youth, than by the other; that is, by shewing a more certain and shorter way to the knowledge of our <hi>British</hi> History, as you see I have already done in relation to the Universal History, for who is there that doth not esteem it a shamefull thing, to be thought a Stranger in his own City, a Foreigner in his own Countrey? As for me what <hi>M. Cicero</hi> said once of the Latine Poets to the <hi>Romans,</hi> I should with much greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence apply to <hi>English</hi> men as to the Histories of <hi>Britain; None can seem Learned to me, who is ignorant of what is our own.</hi>

In truth to search out the great Actions of other Countries, and in the mean time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise our own, is a certain sign either of a most Lazy inactivity, or of a soft and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly delicacy; for though that which Sir <hi>Henry Savil</hi> (the great and eternally to be <note place="margin">Epist. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim. ad <hi>Malmsber.</hi> Anno 1601.</note> remembred Ornament of our <hi>University,)</hi> saith is most certainly true, and confirmed not onely by his, but by the Testimony also of Mr. <hi>John Selden</hi> the Lawyer, a man not onely excellently versed in History, but in all other sorts of ancient Learning; <hi>that there was never yet any man who hath</hi>

But be this as it will, I shall with the greatest confidence assert that there are many noble Actions, and things that are worthy of our Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation and Observation, which will occur in the reading of the greatest part of our Histories; this then is the order which I should recommend for the reading of our <hi>British History</hi> to the Studious in it. First, Let our Student begin with the famous Sir <hi>William Camden</hi>'s <hi>Britannia,</hi> in which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a most accurate description of the <note place="margin">

the History of the first Inhabitants, and an account given of the <hi>Origine</hi> of the Name; the Manners of the <hi>Britains,</hi> the History of the <hi>Romans in Britain,</hi> and many other things infinitely worth our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, collected not out <hi>of mere fictions and fables, which none but a vain man would write, nor any but an ignorant man believe,</hi> (as he expresseth himself,) but out of the most sincere and uncorrupted Monuments of Antiquity; my advice therefore is that this Book, or rather treasury should in the very first place be most diligently perused, nor will it be amiss here to call in the assistence of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s two Books of Collections, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Seldeni</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalecta.</note> of the Antiquities of the <hi>Britains</hi> and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, either of which Books consists of eight Chapters, in which he has collected what doth most properly belong to the ancient Civil Administration of that part of Great <hi>Britain</hi> which is now call'd Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and in which he has most excellently described both from Ancient and Modern Writers; our publick Transactions both Civil and Sacred, and our State Catastro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, and then (according to the method proposed by us in the beginning of our course of History,) the Reader may be pleased to reade over <hi>George Lilly</hi>'s Chronicle, (or short Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) of the Kings and Princes, who by the <note place="margin">He flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the year of Christ 1560.</note> changes of Fortune in diverse and succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding times, have been possessed of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Britain,</hi> or those Commentaries

                     <hi>Stephen;</hi> this Authour was not for Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning inferiour to <hi>Ingulfus,</hi> he was first <hi>Archdeacon</hi> of <hi>Bath</hi> and afterwards of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Vicechancellour</hi> to the King; he wrote about the year 1190, and he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the year 1200; his Life has been writ by those that published his other Works, but this History was never prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before.

                  <p>The next in this new Collection is the <note place="margin">The Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of <hi>Mailros.</hi>
                     </note> Chronicle of <hi>Mailros,</hi> begun as the inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tells us by the <hi>Abbat</hi> of <hi>Dundraynan</hi> from the year 735, and continued by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hands to the year one thousand two hundred and seventy, which was the LIV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third: who this Abbat, or who these Continuers were is not certainly known, but this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie of <hi>Mailros,</hi> from which this Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle has its Name, was not that ancient Monastery placed upon the Banks of the River <hi>Tweed,</hi> often taken notice of by <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable</hi>

                     <hi>Bede,</hi> which as it seems was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Danes,</hi> who oppressed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Northumberland</hi> a great while, but of a later date built in the same place by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who under <hi>David</hi> their King had got possession of it, about the year 1136, from whence perhaps a Colony of Monks were sent to <hi>Dundraynan,</hi> in <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the year 1152, in which year also that Monastery was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as this Chronicle bears witness, which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66025:101"/>
though for the most part it is very brief, yet it affords many things that are worth the knowing, especially the Series of the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as also the Successions of the Princes, Nobles, Bishop, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats in those Northern parts, thus far the Publisher.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1252, another silly Monk of <hi>Mailros,</hi> began a new Collection, in which he would needs bestow an <hi>Encomium</hi> upon <hi>Simon de Montefort,</hi> the turbulent Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> which is not continued, for the rest is perhaps done by another hand, but concludes with the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, so that there is onely two years added.</p>

of <hi>Paris</hi> printed at <hi>London</hi> in 1650, thus far the Publisher; it begins <hi>Anno</hi> 1004, and it ends <hi>Anno</hi> 1263.</p>
                  <p>The Last which is the continuation of <note place="margin">The History of <hi>Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </note> the History of <hi>Croyland,</hi> though in some places imperfect, which the Transcriber perhaps observed not, yet we <hi>(saith the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher,)</hi> thought fit to add it not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Authour, or (rather perhaps) Authours, designed a continuation of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulfus</hi> and <hi>Peter Blesensis,</hi> but chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the latter end of the Reign of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the sixth, and the whole Reign of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the fourth, are contained in this Chronicle, which are not in any of our own Latine Historians, which have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been printed; it begins <hi>Anno</hi> 1149, and it ends 1486, which was the second year of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
                  <p>This last Authour belongs to the next Section, where the Reader will find our Authour for want of Historians of our own Nation, turning his Reader over to <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Virgil,</hi> from the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, to the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, much of which chasme this last Authour hath supplied, but yet I would not part him from the rest, but onely give the Reader this hint to what times he belongs.</p>

have not as yet seen the publick Light. Therefore I will recommend to my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers a History which may be had, that is one of the Published Authours, and may be come by; now here had been a vast Gap of almost LXX years, if <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> had <note place="margin">He flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> Anno 1542.</note> not prevented it, which in so great a scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of our own Authours, the Studious Historian will not unwillingly take in, for although (as the noble Sir <hi>Henry Savil</hi> writes of him,) <hi>he was an</hi> Italian, <hi>and a Stranger to our affairs, and which is yet more, never employed in any publick Station, and of no great natural, either Judgment or Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and although in delivering our History, he has often mistaken things, and passed over in silence many things worthy to be known, yea has too often imbraced things that are false instead of truth, and so left us a very faulty History.</hi> Yet I should conceive this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for the most part, where he describes the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, for besides that he was ignorant of our Tongue, he must of necessity not know many things that were then Transacted, and it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable, he writ some things in favour of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> otherwise than he knew they were, but this is not to be suspected of the former times. Let our Reader therefore take the History of the two <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and the VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and of the two <hi>Edwards</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> from <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the third who immediately follows these was written by

                  <hi>Henry</hi> VIIth succeeded <hi>Richard</hi> the third, whose Life and Reign was not long since represented to us by the most noble <hi>Viscount Verulam,</hi> so happily and so fully, that if he hath not excelled the best Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, he yet at least equall'd them; this Work was first written in English, but has since been turned into Latine, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary Epistle to the Book call'd <hi>Gusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi> saith.

                     <hi>Camden</hi>'s Annals of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> are deservedly due to them and much more, for he being his Patron, as he saith, and Founder of the History <hi>Lecture</hi> in <hi>Oxon</hi> which our Authour then had, he would not break into those Commendations of him, which he otherwise would have done, lest his gratitude might have seemed to have bribed his Judgment; but I believe it is granted by all the Learned World, that <hi>Camden</hi>'s <hi>Annals</hi> is one of the best pieces that hath seen the Light since the reviving of Learning in this Western part of the World, and that great Princess had this additional felicity given her from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that as her Reign was long and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, and her memory is precious still, and ever will be to all English men, so she found in <hi>Camden</hi> a noble, learned, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, ingenious Celebratour of her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which hath given her a second Life here on Earth, in the memories of men, which shall last till the Resurrection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state her in the third, the last and most perfect Life of consummated Glory; but then all this is meant of the Original La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, for the English Version which we now have, is a poor mean harsh style, and translated not from the Latine neither, but from a <hi>French</hi> translation, so that I will ever hope to see an Elegant new Version, made upon the Original, and in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree worthy of that great man.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Although we have no perfect Body of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish History in Latin, Written according to the dignity of the Subject, yet we have some that have done it very well in English. <hi>John Speed</hi> his Theatre of the <hi>British</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, is an Illustrious Work, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated in the first place by our Youth, and especially by those that intend to Travell.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt now, if any of our Countreymen, who are desirous to Reade the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>England,</hi> be so delicate, that he thinks it a task of too much labour and trouble to undertake the Reading of so many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, and therefore would rather chuse some one Historian (who may serve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of all the rest) and stick to, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue him alone: He must remember, as I said before, that there is no such Latin Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian extant, who hath well described the Affairs of <hi>Britain,</hi> from its first Inhabiting to our Times: but yet there are some, who, in English, have commendably attempted to doe this. Amongst whom, I shall not fear to commend in the first place, that famous Man <hi>John Speed.</hi> He having travell'd over all <hi>Great Britain,</hi> read diligently all our own Historians, and those of our neighbour Nations, together with a diligent search in the Publick <hi>Offices, Rolls, Monuments,</hi> and Ancient Writings, or Charters, built up a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:66025:107"/>
Splendid and Admired <hi>Theatre</hi> of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Empire;</hi> which, with great Expedition and Labour, he perfected in XIV. years, in Ten (Scenes, or) Books, in this order. In his First <hi>Scene,</hi> he hath most excellently represented the image of this Kingdom, with its distinct Counties, and Principal Cities and Towns: In his IId. he Exhibits all the Provinces of <hi>Wales:</hi> In the IIId. he gives a Description of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland:</hi> In the IVth, he shews the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all the several parts of it. Nor has he onely proposed to our view, the naked Images, and bare Maps, though he has done that too with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness and beauty, in these Four first <hi>Scenes:</hi> but he hath also, by short Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, adjoin'd to his Maps, discovered whatever in each part is Memorable and Worthy to be seen, or taken notice of. If from thence the Reader turns his Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Vth <hi>Scene,</hi> he will see the Situation and Greatness of the <hi>British Islands:</hi> the Ancient Names, first Inhabitants, Manners, Polities, with the most Ancient Kings and Governours. When he comes to the VIth <hi>Scene,</hi> he will find there the Successions and Actions of those <hi>Monarchs</hi> and <hi>Presidents,</hi> who flourished during the times in which the <hi>Romans</hi> were Masters of <hi>Britain:</hi> In the VIIth <hi>Scene</hi> the Authour doth express the History of the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>English Monarchs,</hi> and the times of their Reigns. In the VIIIth <hi>Scene</hi> he Commemorates the Origine
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:66025:108"/>
of the <hi>Danes,</hi> their Expeditions and Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions into <hi>England,</hi> and all their Actions here which are worth the taking notice of. In the IXth he describes the Invasion of the <hi>Normans,</hi> their Conquest, and the History of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and all his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours: And lastly, in the Xth <hi>Scene,</hi> he hath contained the Joyfull Entrance of <hi>James</hi> the First, the most happy Union of the Two Kingdoms, and the Peace esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by King <hi>James</hi> with all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Kings and Princes. And then, as a <hi>Corollary</hi> the <hi>Venerable Authour</hi> doth, with a Vivid and Unaffected Style (which runs through his whole Work) most clearly shew, that horrible black, and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard of Design of the <hi>Gunpowder-Plot,</hi> which was by God miraculously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and prevented.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I do most earnestly exhort our Young Men, and especially those who are of Noble birth, and intend to Travell, that they would first peruse this beautifull <hi>Theatre</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and run over all the parts of it, before they Travell into Foreign Countries, or visit strange Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For though I will not deny, that the desire of knowing the various Laws of Countries, the searching out the Rites and Customs of many several People, and the seeing the Forms of divers Cities, is a very commendable affection, and which was highly celebrated in <hi>Ulysses:</hi> yet I think it is preposterous, if not absurd, to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:66025:108"/>
desire to see Foreign, and far distant things, and in the mean time neglect what is nearer and at home; to seek out Cities that are Situate abroad, and afar off; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to see nor know those we have at home. And this is the more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, because our <hi>Britain</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is base and hurtfull and unworthy a good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to search into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the things that belong to Strangers; and in the Interim never to consider the good things of their own Countries, neither ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving nor magnifying the Vertues of their own Princes, which is ever before their Eyes. <hi>Georg. Fabrit.</hi>
                  </note> is one of the most celebrated Islands in the whole World, and hath many famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in it, many Temples Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and August for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Venerable for their Antiquity, and Conspicuous for their Ornaments and Splendour; we have Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which are enobled by <hi>Fame;</hi> Fountains, that for their use and effects, are admir'd; Navigable Rivers and safe Ports, and many other things which are infinitely worth our perusal and knowledge. Therefore let we persuade you, Young Men, once or more to view, and with great attention to run through the four First <hi>Scenes</hi> of this Theatre, I mean the <hi>Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical</hi> part. I am much deceived, if there be any where, under Heaven, a Countrey that can boast of more Monuments which deserve to be seen: Then go through the other Six <hi>Scenes,</hi> and reade the <hi>Historical</hi> part seriously; I will become your Surety, that you shall find in every one of these Parts, some things that are very well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of remembring. Nor do I think there
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66025:109"/>
is any Countrey under Heaven which has so much reason to Glory in the Illustrious Atchievements of her Children as ours hath. To conclude, this you may be sure of, that which soever of you hath treasured up the greatest number of our domestick affairs and things; and does freely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them to Foreigners wheresoever he comes (which for the most part is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by most Men) he will be the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comest Guest, and will have the greatest liberty of inquiring (as doth become a Traveller) into the Manners and Laws of those People he comes amongst, and of asking concerning the forms of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their Princes, Wars and Accidents, or whatever other events are worth the observing; and so will return home much the better furnished with the desired fruits of his Travels.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have discoursed of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical, or Civil Histories, and in what Order they are to be read.</p>

                  <head>ADDITION.</head>
                  <p>As I have before given an account as well as I could, and in the ends of the IV foregoing Sections, discoursed of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Historians of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, which have been Printed since our Authour wrote, so I will here with the Reader'<hi>s</hi> leave, take the same liberty in relation to the <hi>English</hi> Historians of our Nation, some of which have been Printed since the Authour finished this piece, and others perhaps were omitted by him, because these Lectures were read in an <hi>University,</hi> and to men generally well acquainted with the Latine Tongue.</p>
                  <p>The first that I will take notice of is Mr. <hi>Aylet Sammes</hi> his <hi>Britannia Antiqua Illustrata,</hi> or the Antiquities of ancient <hi>Britain,</hi> derived from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> wherein the Original Trade of this Island is discovered, the names of Places, Offices, Dignities, as likewise the Idolatry, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Customes of the primitive Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, are clearly demonstrated from that Nation; many old Monuments illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Commerce with that People as well as the <hi>Greeks</hi> plainly set forth, and Collected out of approved <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Authours, together with a <hi>Chronologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> History of this Kingdom, from the first traditional beginning untill the year of our Lord 800, when the Name of <hi>BRITAIN</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:66025:110"/>
was changed into <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Collected out of the best Authours, and disposed in a better method than hath hitherto been done, with the Antiquities of the <hi>Saxons</hi> as well as <hi>Phoenicians, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> Printed in Folio in <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1676, Volume the first.</p>
                  <p>I know very well some Learned men have taken great exceptions to this Piece and have affirmed many things in it to be fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and I will not contest for the truth of the whole, and every part of it, but then I will presume to say that I have found good Authority for some of those things which some have pretended Mr. <hi>Samms</hi> invented, and if we are to stay for an History, which all the World approves of before we reade one, our Lives will end with as little knowledge of past times, as of those that are to follow us when we are dead; I know any ingenious person who shall reade this piece, must reap much satisfaction, pleasure and delight from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Milton</hi> who was <hi>Latine Secretary to Oliver Cromwell,</hi> a Learned, ingenious, but a very factious man, wrote the History of <hi>Britain,</hi> that part especially that is called <hi>England,</hi> from the first traditional begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it to the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of the ancientest and best Authours (as he saith,) it was printed 1670, and 1671, in <hi>Quarto,</hi> and in 1678 in <hi>Octavo.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:66025:110"/>
The style and composure of this History is delicate, short and perspicuous, and it is of the greater value, because few of our English Writers begin (to any purpose) before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, passing over all those times that went before it with a slight hand.</p>
                  <p>Doctour <hi>John Heyward</hi> writ the History of the first <hi>Norman</hi> Kings, <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour, William Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the first; he lived in the times of King <hi>James,</hi> and was a <hi>Civilian</hi> and a very candid, true and Learned Writer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Samuel Daniel</hi> writ the Collection of the History of <hi>England,</hi> where in making some short reflexions on the State of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Succession of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> he descends to <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> and the <hi>Norman</hi> Kings, and ends with the Reign of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1376.</p>
                  <p>It is written with great brevity and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteness, and his Political and Moral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions are very fine, usefull and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Trussel</hi> continued this History with the like brevity and truth, but not with equal Elegance, till the end of the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1484.</p>

                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:66025:111"/>
In that Period or interval of time which <hi>Daniel</hi> hath written, there are two Lives writ by two several Pens, the first is the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, writ by that Learned, wise and ingenious Gentleman Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> Knight, in a Masculine style, with great labour and pains, and with a Loyal design.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Second is a piece which was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Printed with this Title; the History of the Life, Reign and Death of <hi>Edward</hi> the II King of <hi>England,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the Rise and Fall of his great Favorites, <hi>Gaveston</hi> and the <hi>Spencers,</hi> written by <hi>E. F.</hi> in the year 1627, and Printed <hi>verbatim</hi> from the Original in the year 1680.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who this <hi>E. F.</hi> was I know not, but that he was under the Dominion of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Discontent, is apparent by his short Preface to the Reader, his first words there are these.

                        <p>To out-run those weary hours, of a deep and sad Passion, my melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pen fell accidentally <hi>(saith he,)</hi> on this Historical Relation, which speaks A King, our own, though one of the most unfortunate, and shews the Pride and fall of his inglorious Minions.</p>

                  <p>If this Book was really written when pretended, it may be probably conjectured
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66025:111"/>
this Male-Content had a mighty Spleen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the then <hi>Duke of Buckingham,</hi> who being baited this year by the Commons in Parliament, fell a Sacrifice to popular discontent the year following, which with some other things to me unknown, might occasion the suppressing this History then, and it had been as well, if it had never been Printed, being partial to the highest degree and designed to encourage rather than suppress Rebellion, Sedition and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and now why it was raked up out of the Dust and Printed when it was, I shall leave the World to guess; onely I cannot for bear observing, the Authour was more ingenuous than the Publisher, not onely because he concealed it, but also because he had undoubtedly set down the causes of his discontent, in the beginning of his Preface, which are omitted in the Print, for <hi>those weary hours</hi> must relate to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before exprest, to perfect the nse.</p>
                  <p>Within this Period of time belonging to <hi>Trussel</hi> falls in the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, written by Dr. <hi>Heyward,</hi> and also the Life of <hi>Edward</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, written very Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly and Prudently, by <hi>William Habing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Esquire, and the Life of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, written by <hi>George Buck</hi> Gent.</p>

                     <hi>Edward Lord Herbert of Sherbury,</hi> hath writ the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, with great Exactness and Accuracy, as he was a person of great industry and capacity. He was put upon this Work by King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, and consulted all our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>John Heyward</hi> wrote the Life of <hi>Edward</hi> the VIth, very Elegantly, and as much of that Prince's Reign, and that of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was spent in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; so Dr. <hi>Peter Heylin</hi> in his <hi>Ecclesia Anglicana Restaurata,</hi> has given a very good account of their two Reigns, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Dr. <hi>Gilbert Burnet</hi> in his History of the Reformation in two Volumes in Folio, which is excellently Epitomized by himself in Octavo.</p>
                  <p>Though these two chiefly intend the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> History of those times, yet they have carefully intermixt the Civil History also, especially <hi>Burnet,</hi> who with his History hath published many Original Records of those times, which do purely belong to the Civil History.</p>

Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi> one of the Kings of Arms in England, hath writ two Books which he styles the <hi>Baronage</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> being an excellent History of the Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all the noble Families of England, which is of excellent use to the well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the English History.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> hath written a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of the Kings of England, from the times of the <hi>Romans</hi> Government, unto the Death of King <hi>James,</hi> to which the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the first, and the first 13 years of <hi>Charles</hi> the second, were added by one Mr. <hi>Edward Phillips,</hi> which ends with the Coronation of that Prince being the 23d. of <hi>April</hi> 1661.</p>
                  <p>The former Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi> (as is supposed,) hath writ a short account of the late troubles of England, wherein all the proceedings of the Rebellion are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently laid together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>James Heath</hi> Gent. hath also written the History of the same times (very well as it is said,) to the <hi>Restitution</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the second, continued since to the year 1675 by <hi>J. Phillips.</hi>

                     <hi>William Sanderson</hi> hath written not onely the Reigns of Queen <hi>Mary of.

his late Majesty's Restitution, so there are many things in it (as it is said) which will need amendment.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, there hath been never a good History writ since <hi>Camden</hi>'s Annals, of our affairs that ever yet came to my knowledge; nor perhaps have the times been such as to bear one; that of <hi>Tacitus</hi> is considerable, <hi>the prosperous and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Events of the ancient</hi> People of Rome <hi>are delivered by great Writers, in the times of</hi> Augustus <hi>there was no want of generous</hi>

History from all suspicion of a necessitated Compliance, yet then he being a Stranger to our English Laws and Constitutions, has committed some faults which an English man would have easily avoided, and speaks too contemptuously of some of our Greatest Lawyers, whom he styles every where <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guleii,</hi> as if they had been some little snar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Countrey Attornies.</p>

                     <p>The design and method of this Appendix, in what order we should proceed in relation to particular Historians; the principal Writers of each Countrey are to be selected; the Historians of the latter Ages compared with the more Ancient.</p>

                  <p>THus far our Authour (Mr. <hi>Deg. Wheare)</hi> has proceeded concerning the <hi>Civil History,</hi> and was just now going to lead his Reader to the <hi>Church History,</hi> and yet we will presume to stop him here a small time, and I will not despair neither of obtaining an easie pardon for this my unseasonable
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66025:115"/>
interposition from those who desire to run through a perfect Collection of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, especially if they shall be sensible that these Endeavours of ours may in any degree promote their Studies. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire</hi> long since sinking under its own weight, and being at last torn in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and divided, each distinct Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rely upon its own Forces, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred its own affairs both at home and abroad, and from thence the <hi>particular Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories</hi> of particular Nations have sprung <note place="margin">See afore Sect. 26.</note> up, which our Authour hath left untouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unsaluted, the British onely excepted, and this Field I will presume to Reap, by adding here an <hi>Appendix</hi> concerning the Histories of those Nations, who are now possest of some part of the ancient <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> or were never subject to it, in which we will represent, or at least inarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially describe those ancient and Modern Writers, who have illustrated the affairs and Actions of the more considerable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by their Pens. 'Tis not indeed our purpose to seek curiously after, and name all these Historians, (as indeed who can pretend to know them?) or solicitously to digest, and accurately treat of them, which is a very troublesome business, and above our Abilities.</p>
                  <p>But I think it reasonable here to advise all the lovers of History in the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Work, that they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the Antiquities of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66025:115"/>
(as for instance, the <hi>Britains</hi> with the <hi>British,)</hi> and so proceed to those of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, and in the first place to those Nations which have had frequent Leagues, Wars or Commerce with their own. And it will also be very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to chuse some principal Authour, who may seem to excell all other in writing the History of that Countrey, as in the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> History <hi>Lambertus Schafnaburgensis,</hi> in the <hi>Austrian</hi> History <hi>Lazius,</hi> in the <hi>Hungarian Bonfinius,</hi> in the <hi>Gothick Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandes,</hi> in the History of <hi>Denmark Saxo Grammaticus,</hi> in the <hi>Sclavonian Helmoldus,</hi> in the <hi>Longobardian Paulus Diaconus,</hi> in the <hi>Polonian Chromerus,</hi> in the <hi>Prussian Stella,</hi> in the <hi>Bohemian Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> in that of <hi>Switzars Simlerus,</hi> in the <hi>Burgundian Heu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus,</hi> in that of <hi>Saxony Crantzius,</hi> in the <hi>Bavarian Aventinus,</hi> in the <hi>Flandrian Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jerus,</hi> in the <hi>Dutch Grotius,</hi> in the <hi>French P. Aemylius,</hi> in the <hi>Spanish Mariana,</hi> and so for the rest.</p>
                  <p>But here our Reader of the <hi>Barbarian History,</hi> may be pleased to understand that the Authours for the most part with which he is now to Converse, do sink very much beneath the Eloquence of those of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Nations, the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and that they are very much inferiour both in Ability and Dignity, to those who with their Pens have adorn'd the Stories of those once potent People, not onely in many other things, but especially in the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66025:116"/>
purity of their Styles; for in the darkness of that decrepit Age, they use a style which by reason of the Barbarity and harshness of it cannot but offend those whose Ears have been used to a terse and delicate phrase; and the Historians of those times which affected Elegance, chose to imitate those of the middle Ages; <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropius, Paulus Diaconus, Orosius,</hi> and the like, who were as remote from the <hi>Roman</hi> Eloquence, as they were from the times in which it flourished, rather than <hi>Caesar, Salust, Livy,</hi> and the rest of the great Princes of the Senate of Historians, in which the native Vigour and Spirit of the <hi>Roman</hi> Language exerts it self, and in truth there are not many who aimed at the perfections of those middle Writers, and they are yet more scarce who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to that degree of perfection, and yet they are not to be persecuted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended for this neither, because they fell into this Misfortune, more by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of the times in which they Lived, than by their own faults, which is enough to bespeak their Pardon with all candid Readers. In ancient Coins we regard the Weight, and the Matter much more than the Neatness of the Stamp, and so in those Authours which have been depressed by the iniquity of their times, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by disabled from shewing their Vertues, we ought rather to consider the weight and excellence of the things they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:66025:116"/>
than the brightness or sweetness of Discourse; what <hi>Cicero</hi> said of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, <hi>if they bring with them Eloquence,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. de fin.</note> 
                     <hi>it is not to be despised, but if they have it not, it is not mightily to be desired,</hi> is by us to be applied to an Historian.</p>
                  <p>But as to those who Wrote after the reviving of Learning, and the restitution of the Just esteem of Eloquence; (as there is a Circulation of all things,) they I say, have more illustrated History, and treated it according to its Dignity, so that the following Ages have many Historians, which if I should presume to compare with the <hi>Ancient</hi> Writers, I should not be destitute of the suffrage of the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test men, for men of no mean Learning have heretofore thought that <hi>Guicciardin, Comines</hi> and <hi>Aemilius,</hi> were so far from being inferiour to <hi>Livy, Salust</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> that they might contest the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them.</p>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:66025:136"/>
instance, what he relates Concisely and Elegantly concerning the fall of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the Migration of the Northern Nations, and the rise and increase of the Papal Power; and yet a man ought not to be secure here neither, except he hath the faculty of separating the Ore from the Dross.

               <argument>
                  <p>A Transition to the <hi>Church History;</hi> who were better able to have done this; two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of time especially to be observed; the <hi>Bible</hi> contains the first Period, and with it <hi>Josephus</hi> his Antiquities are to be read The Judgments of Learned men concerning <hi>Josephus; Hegesippus</hi> though ascribed to a wrong Authour not to be rejected: in what sense that Authour is usefull and commendable: the Sacred History of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius Severus</hi> is deservedly recommended to the Reader.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen I was once got thus far, I thought verily I had performed the Work I undertook, as the Subject of my first Chapter; but some Learned young
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:66025:138"/>
men who heretofore were my Hearers, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished me, that it was much desired that I should in the same manner give an account of the Writers of the <hi>Church History.</hi> Now though I thought this might much more reasonably be desired at the hands of him who is the greatest Divine we have, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The most Learned Doctour, Dr. <hi>John Prideaux,</hi> Master of <hi>Exon</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</note> 
                  <hi>Professor,</hi> an excellent Person; A plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull fountain, as of all other sorts of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, so, amongst the rest, of all sorts of Histories; at whose Waters, I have very often, with the greatest pleasure, quench'd my thirst: yet because some of my more Learned Acquintance persuaded me to doe it; I did not hink it fit wholly to decline the task. So, at last, I resolved to adjoin here a Chain of the Writers of the <hi>Church History.</hi> Whoever therefore desires to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, and in a good Order and Method reade the Ecclesiastical History, should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to himself two Intervals of time (that I may pass over the thing with as few words as is possible.) The first of these is from the Creation of the World to the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ our Redeemer; during which interval of time, the Church of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> (call'd the <hi>Jewish,)</hi> is storied to have sometimes flourished, and at others to have suffered a hard servitude under se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Tyrants: the other period is, from the Incarnation of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to the Age in which we live, in which the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or Christian Church, performs its warfare. The first Interval contains Four
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66025:138"/>
thousand years, abating Fifty, if we may believe <hi>Scaliger</hi> (whom we have all along hitherto followed.) The second contains One thousand six hundred, and so many years over as we commonly count, and are still going on. And therefore it is, the Story of that first interval, I say, is to be fetched, in the first place, from the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, which the Reader ought, above all others, in the first place diligently to turn over, and studiously to search into, and he will soon see his Labour is well bestowed, if together with the Scriptures, he take in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>

For in these Books, the Eloquent Son of <hi>Matathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> has woven the History of the Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament-Church, from the Creation of the World, to the last destruction of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which happened somewhat above Four thousand and thirty years after the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World: and that with so great a fidelity, that St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> no dull Censor, gave him a place amongst the <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi>

                  <hi>Writers.</hi> And the great <hi>Scaliger</hi> thought it more reasonable to believe him, than all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, not onely in the Jewish affairs, but also in what he relates concerning other Nations. <hi>That there are</hi> (saith <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Civil Lawyer) <note place="margin">De Institut.

                  <hi>some mistakes in</hi> Josephus, <hi>who can deny? But then how many true, great, and necessary
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:66025:139"/>
things are there in him for the illustration of the Sacred History?</hi> besides, what others call falsehood, <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> more mildly calls <hi>errours;</hi> they being the deviations of an Ignorant Man, not the Lies and Frauds of a Deceiver. Some Man would here persuade the Reader to subjoin, or rather take in together with <hi>Josephus</hi> his History of the Wars of the Jews, <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> an excellent Authour, in the Opinion of <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> a Man of an approved Faith, and a <note place="margin">

But in the esteem of the most Learned <hi>Casaubon</hi> and <hi>Vossius,</hi> he is a Spurious, Pretending, and Suppositious, and, in short, an Authour of no Antiquity, or at least quite another Man from that Noble <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved near the times of the Apostles, and was Contemporary with <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Athenagoras,</hi> of whom frequent mention is made by <hi>Eusebius</hi> and St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and yet after all this, there are some who think he is no contemptible, or unprofitable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. in his first Book he has given an Account of the Wars of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the times of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> to the Birth of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the death of <hi>Herod (the Great.)</hi> And in his Second Book he brings down the History to the Expedition of <hi>Vespasian</hi> into <hi>Judaea, Anno Christi</hi> 69. and then in his IIId, IVth and Vth Books, he
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:66025:139"/>
has Consecrated to the memory of Posterity, the Story of the total devastation of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and the utter Ruine of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian</hi> and his Son <hi>Titus,</hi> which happened <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 72. But then saith <hi>Bodinus, This may be better and more truely Learned from</hi> Josephus, <hi>who was not onely present in these Wars, but was a Commander for some time, and being made a Captive, obtain'd from</hi> Vespasian <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>the Privilege of being made a Citizen of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the</hi> Flavian <hi>Sir-name,</hi> (which was that of their own Family) <hi>and also a Statue.</hi> And then <hi>the Princelike Virtues</hi> of an <hi>Historian, an exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted erudition, a rare integrity, and a great experience shone clearly in that person.</hi> And it is farther objected against this fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> that he doth not treat of the Affairs of the Church, but onely of those of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the time of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> to the ruine of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> But we may Answer <hi>Bodinus</hi> in the first place; that this <hi>Hegesippus</hi> has shortly and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly comprehended in that Work, what <hi>Josephus</hi> hath more copiously related in his VII. Books of the <hi>Wars of the Jews,</hi> and scatteringly in his <hi>Antiquities.</hi> And in the next place, that this Authour doth no less religiously than truely set forth some things concerning our Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> which are either altogether passed by, by <hi>Josephus,</hi> or onely slightly mention'd by him, because perhaps he had an aversion for our Religion. And he also sets down,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66025:140"/>
in a few words, the causes of the War; doth Learnedly shew the sources of those great Calamities; and why that People, which alone was chosen by God, and beloved very much, was thus consum'd; why <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was destroy'd, which was not onely the most Celebrated City of all the <hi>East,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> calls it: but, (if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <note place="margin">

Why the Temple was rased; their Sacred Rites abolished; and the Politick Government of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had subsisted so many Ages, was for ever taken away.

               <p>Or if our Reader of History is better pleased to pass by this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positious Authour; and will <note place="margin">That Authour which is commonly call'd <hi>Hegesip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> is <hi>Josephus</hi> Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>Latin,</hi> by St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:66025:140"/>
World, and ends with the Synod of <hi>Borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux, Anno Christi</hi> 386. He was a Man of much learning and prudence; and a most Polite Writer. His style is so pure and elegant, that <hi>Josephus Scaliger</hi> calls him, <hi>The most Pure Writer of the Church History.</hi> But I cannot forbear confirming the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this great Man, by the more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix, and yet not less elegant testimony of <hi>Victor Giselin,</hi> a Physician and Antiquary of a most accomplish'd Erudition. He writes thus, <hi>The blessed</hi> Sulpitius <hi>hath with great brevity compris'd, and with an exact distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of times, shortly deduced to the Age in which he lived, the Memory of those things which are contained in the Holy Scriptures, from the beginning of the World. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Age hath produced Another Work that is more excellent, more noble and more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Christian Church than this small Piece, I shall willingly leave to the Judgment of those who have better abilities than I to determine of it. But as to the Elegance of it, I dare undertake, and I think I may safely affirm, that it is not inferiour, in any thing, to the best of all the Church Historians: but then, as to all other Works, which are of the same nature, it hath so great advantages over</hi> them, <hi>that they do not deserve to be compared with it. That which I have said of it, is great, and may perhaps seem to most men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. But yet what I say, has so much truth in it, that I am confident the veracity of the thing will prevail so much, that my testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:66025:141"/>
may be spared, especially as to those who will take the Pains to compare all the parts of this Authour, with</hi> Orosius, Florus, Eutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius, <hi>and the rest of the Writers of</hi> Epitomes. <hi>He seems to me to have obtain'd the Garland onely by the imitation of</hi> C. Salustius <hi>a florid Writer of the</hi> Roman <hi>Story. For observing that many things in him passed for excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which would become no other Man, and were scarce possible to be imitated; as his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt way of speaking, which slips insensibly by the Reader or Hearer, and doth not stay till a Man comes to it; but, as</hi> Seneca <hi>saith, his Sentences come pouring in, and his words sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize by their unexpected falls; these, I say, be left to</hi> Salust, <hi>as his sole personal excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. And he studiously avoided his obsolete words, which (as</hi> Augustus <hi>said) he collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of</hi> Cato'<hi>s Books</hi> de Originibus. <hi>But then as to his spruce brevity, tempered with significant Words, and adapted in the highest degree to his design; he imitated that Great Historian with so much Art, that we may well say, he rather emulated him</hi> (and strove to out-doe him.) <hi>For he did not think it sufficient to follow his style, and to divide, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribe, and cut it, and make just such transitions from one thing to another, except he made the same</hi> entrances <hi>to his Books the other did, but with this difference, that whereas he</hi> (as <hi>Fabius</hi> saith) <hi>chose such as had no relation to History;</hi> Sulpitius <hi>accommodated his a little better to his subject. All which things, in History at least, appear glorious,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:66025:141"/>

                  <p>The History of the Second Interval (that is of the Christian Church) is first to be sought for in the Evangelists, and the other Books of the New Testament, where its Infancy is describ'd; there is scarce any besides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, who were eye-witnesses of any part of its first state, and describ'd it: there are some pieces indeed still in being, whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours are said to have lived in the same time, and to have described the brave en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters of the first Matyrs; but they are thought to be spurious by Learned Men, because they are overrun with fables. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> confesseth some of the Later Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are guilty of this fault. <hi>Vives</hi> and <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> doe both make the same complaint. As also some of the Ancients; and therefore the History of the Church is to be read with care. And yet too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity is to be shun'd.

Abdias</hi> the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Abdias.</note> one of the LXXII. Disciples, (if we may be believe him) who is said to have Wrote X. Books of the Sufferings of the

Apostles. <hi>Linus</hi> his Account of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdoms of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The <note place="margin">Linus.</note> Relation of the Sufferings of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> the Apostle, Written by a Presbyter of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia,</hi> and others; which yet are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Ancient Fathers reputed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred amongst the Suppositious and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal Writers; and even <hi>Baronius, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, Sextus Sinensis, Melchior Canus,</hi> and many other very Learned Men, of this and the foregoing Age: Because, in truth, they are stuft with a parcel of such silly Fables, that they deserve no credit in those things which perhaps are true.</p>
               <p>Nor are onely the Writers, as they are commonly call'd of the very first Age, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to this fault, but many also of the latter Writers, who writing of the more Ancient times, and being sick, as it were, of too great a <hi>Credulity,</hi> do strangely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with devised Fables.

And that I may speak of the more Ancient, it is very difficult to find any of them, who have published Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries on this subject, which have hit the truth in all points.</q> 
                  <hi>John Luis Vives</hi> made just such a Complaint before <hi>Baronius.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 5. de trad. discip. p. 360.</note>I have <hi>(said he)</hi> been much afflicted, when I have seriously considered
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:66025:143"/>
with my self, how diligently, and with what exact care, the Actions of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Hannibal, Scipio, Pompey, Caesar,</hi> and other Commanders: and the Lives of <hi>Socrates, Plato, Aristotle,</hi> and others of the Philosophers have been written, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an everlasting remembrance, so that there is not the least danger they can ever be lost: But then the Acts of the Apostles, and Martyrs, and of the Saints of our Religion, and the Affairs of the Rising and Established Church, being involved in much darkness, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most totally unknown, though they are of so much greater advantage than the Lives of the Philosophers, or Great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, both as to the improvement of our Knowledge and Practice. For what is written of these holy Men, except a very few things, is very much corrupted and defaced with the mixture of many Fables; whilst the Writer, indulging his own humour, doth not tell us what the Saint did, but what the Historian would have had him done: and the Fancy of the Writer dictates the Life, and not the truth of things.</q> 
                  <hi>Vives</hi> a little after goes on thus. <q>There have been men who have thought it a great piece of Piety to invent Lies for the sake of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which is both dangerous (for fear those things, which are true, should lose their Credit, by the means of these falshoods) and it is by no means necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:66025:144"/>
neither; because our holy Religion is supported with so many true (Miracles) that these false ones, like lazy and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Souldiers, are rather a burthen and a hinderance, than a help or assistence to it. Thus far that Learned <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
                  </q> And because his Countryman, <hi>Melchior Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 11. Locorum, com. p. 533.</note> a Divine of a great (and not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served) reputation with the Papists, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with him in all this; I shall not be unwilling to adjoyn his words too. <q>I speak it with grief, and not by way of reproach, <hi>Laertius</hi> has Written the Lives of the Philosophers with more care and industry, than the Christians have those of the Saints; <hi>Suetonius</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the Lives of the <hi>Caesars</hi> with much more truth and sincerity than the Catholicks have the affairs, I will not say of the Emperours, but even those of the Martyrs, holy Virgins and Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. For they have not conceal'd the Vices, nor the very suspitions of vice, in good and commendable Philosophers or Princes; and in the worst of them they discover the very colours or appearances of Vertue. But the greatest part of our Writers either follow the conduct of their affections, or industriously fain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things; so that I for my part am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often both weary and ashamed of them; because I know they have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by brought nothing of Advantage to the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:66025:144"/>
Church of Christ, but very much incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.</q> Thus saith <hi>Melchior Canus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor are we to think, that it is onely the complaint of the Learned Men of this and the last Age, that the Church Writers are thus corrupted and depraved, as if these faults had crept into them of late onely; or as if none of the most Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had been justly to be numbred amongst these depravers of the Church History. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Thousand and three hundred years agon, before the Church was past its youth, there were some who basely infected the Monuments of the Church with Lies, and made it their business to corrupt them with such impure mixtures. And <hi>Arnobius</hi> in his Books, <hi>Contra Gentes,</hi> hath <note place="margin">Lib. 1. p. 47.</note> taken this notice of it. <hi>But neither</hi> (saith he) <hi>could all that was done, be written, or arrive at the Knowledge of all men. Many of our great Actions being done by obscure Men, and those who had no knowledge of Letters: and if some of them are committed to Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Writings, yet even here, by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Devils, and of men like them, whose great design and study it is to intercept and ruine this truth, by interpolating, or adding some things to them, or by changing, or taking out Words, Syllables, or Letters, they have put a stop to the Faiths of Wise Men, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the truth of things.</hi> Thus <hi>Arnobius.</hi> And in truth, what could possibly be devised to corrupt and debase the Memory of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, which <hi>Pagans, Jews,</hi> or <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:66025:145"/>
have not deceitfully imposed upon her? What hath not a silly and Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Superstition feigned? My <hi>Hearers,</hi> I have pursued these things at large, that they who are desirous to know the Church History, might understand, and diligently consider, with how much care and caution they are to be read: for here a Man is in more danger of being deceived by feign'd stories, than in any other sort of Histories whatsoever. And yet it is confess'd by all, that it is much more mischievous to be involved in errour here, than in <hi>Civil History.</hi> Now as it befits us to take great care on the one side, that we do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace falsehood for truth rashly; so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to consider attentively, that we do not reject what is really true, as false, without deliberation. <hi>I confess</hi> (saith the Learned Lawyer <hi>Balduinus) where there are so many Ambushes, and so many dangers; those</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, p. 93. Edit. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>who remember, that credit is not rashly to be given, deserve to be commended for their sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious modesty and jealousie. But then the unbelief of some others is too great, who will believe nothing but what is written by some one single Authour.</hi> As for example, they will believe nothing that is spoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Apostles, but what is written by St. <hi>Luke.</hi> But then St. <hi>Luke</hi> did chiefly design to Write the History of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and as to that too he omitted some things, as is apparent by the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> St. <hi>Luke,</hi> speaking of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> does
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:66025:145"/>
onely tell us, That in <hi>Samaria,</hi> his own Town, being wrought upon by the Reproof of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he confessed his Sin. But shall we therefore cry out, that whatever those very Ancient Writers, <hi>Justin Martyr, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Arnobius, Eusebius, Epiphanius</hi> and St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> have delivered, besides this concerning him, is false: and therefore in the Reading of Histories, let us ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to be such, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith those men, who are betwixt youth and old age, commonly are: that is, neither too prone to believe, nor too difficult and distrustive: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; that is, <hi>Neither believing, nor disbelieving every thing.</hi> That of <hi>Hesiod</hi> is like an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,

               <p>But some Man may, with great truth, say, That Facility of Belief, and Diffidence, are both, in their turns, of great use and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety. For every verisimilitude is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently true; nor is every thing that seems at first sight incredible to be concluded therefore false. Truth hath sometimes the resemblance of falsehood: and again, a Lie is masked with the beautifull Colours of truth at other times; as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith somewhere.</p>

And therefore (that we may proceed) where we cannot have such Witnesses as were present at the Actions they record; the next care is, to hear those who have faithfully delivered what they received from others: especially if the Ages in which they lived, their Antiquity and Virtue, have given them a right to our Faith and made them of good Authority. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these, it is fit we should prefer the most Ancient (and as I may say) Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick Authours, before the rest. What <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristole</hi> said of Witnesses, is true here; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>The most Ancient deserve most credit, because it is not so easie to corrupt them.</hi> And for the most part it also comes to pass, that by how much the later and newer the Account of any Ancient Transaction is, so much the more faulty and corrupt it proves. For as Wine, by how much the oftner it is poured from one Vessel into another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes so much the more weak and dispi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited: and as Fame, the further it goes, the further it removes from Truth, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers so much the more of Vanity; even so for the most part a History being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by many, and toss'd to and fro, and told every time in other Words, is diffused (takes aire) and at last contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates and degenerates into a mere Fable.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:66025:146"/>
their Pardon, if they please to consider, that all this has no other scope, than the making men extremely cautious in their turning over the Volumes of the <hi>Church History.</hi> And therefore I will now pass on to the Catalogue of those Authours, and the Order of them, which Learned Men have prescribed to be read after the Books of the New Testament, in which I shall be as short as it is fit I should be.</p>

                  <hi>JOhannes Zonaras</hi> flourished above Fifty <note place="margin">Zonaras.</note> years after <hi>Cedrenus,</hi> about the year of Christ, MCXX. he (as is observed above, amongst the Civil Historians) wrote an Universal History, which he divided into three Tomes; the last of which is thought fit in this place to be recommended to the Reader. For, in this, he laboured to describe more exactly whatever had been done in the <hi>East,</hi> from <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, and his Successours, to the times of this Authour; that having been till then attempted by few men. A very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Man observes, that in both his two first Tomes, there are many things not mention'd by any other Authour; but that in his third Tome, for the most part he gives account of those <hi>Bizantine</hi> affairs which are not mentioned by any other Historian besides himself; and were
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:66025:158"/>
it not for him, we should have been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of a great part of the Actions of the latter Emperours of the East. Besides, he interwove the History of the Church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and of the Controversies in Religion that were moved in the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi> Church, and continued it down to the death of <hi>Alexius Comnenus,</hi> an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <note place="margin">Ann. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti 1118.</note> who Reigned in his own times. But that is much to be observed, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked by the Learned <hi>Vossius,</hi> that in the affairs of his own times he is very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and contracts the Life of <hi>Alexius Comnenes</hi> into a very narrow compass. But then <hi>Anna Comnena,</hi> the Daughter of <note place="margin">Anna Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nena.</note> this Emperour, supplied this defect, who wrote several Books on the Life of her Father, and call'd them by the name of <hi>Alexiada's. Zonaras</hi> in his third Tome, near the end, doth much commend the erudition of this Lady; where he speaks of the Learning and Power of <hi>Bryennius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> her husband, in these words. <hi>And he also was given much to study, and his Lady did not take less, but rather more pains in Learning, speaking the</hi> Attick <hi>Dialect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; and having a very sharp wit for the Contemplation of the most abstruse things.</hi> Nor doth the Historian stop here, but goes on and shews, how she became so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Learned. <hi>Having</hi> (saith he) <hi>by the benignity of Nature, obtained great faculties, and improv'd them with industry; she spent much time in reading, and the conversation
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:66025:158"/>
of Learned Men, which she heard diligently.</hi> But many have a great suspicion, that this Royal and Learned Lady, out of her great Love for her Father, is a little too partial in this her History.</p>

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:66025:159"/>
with the greater facility induce them to the Reading of these Authours, I will here paint out the judgment of <hi>Justus Lipsius</hi> upon them. <hi>I confess</hi> (saith he) <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In Not. ad Polit. 1. 6. 9.</note> Nicetas <hi>is not yet publickly and commonly much taken notice of: but he is worthy to be more known; being of a pure and right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if there were any such in that Age; his style is laboured, and tastes of</hi> Homer <hi>and the Poets very often: but then the subject and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it self is distinct, clear, without vanity or trifles, as short as is fit, and faithfull: there is in him frequent and seasonable reflexions or advices: his Judgments of things are not onely free, but sound. In short I wish all Statesmen would reade him, and then I shall not question but some of them will pay me their thanks for this judgment of him, at least I am sure they will owe me thanks.</hi> Thus much of <hi>Choniates:</hi> and of <hi>Gregoras</hi> he gives this judgment; Nicephorus Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras <note place="margin">Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras.</note> 
                  <hi>takes up the History where</hi> Nicetas <hi>ends it, and brings down the thread of his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but he doth not deserve the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations; for though he wrote the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of affairs, from the taking of the City of</hi> Constantinople, <hi>to the death of</hi> Palaeologus <hi>the latter, yet he did it not with the same correctness or industry; and has more of the faults of his Age than the former; he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant and wandering, and indecently, and sometimes imprudently mixeth his own on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and Harangues. Yet his Judgments are thick sown, and for the most part right: the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:66025:160"/>
causes of events are curiously inquired into, and represented; Piety is inculcated, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are seasonably assigned, and turn'd over to the first cause, that is to God. In truth, no Writer has more asserted PROVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCE and FATE. He is to be read for this cause, and also for another; that is, that the greatest part of his History repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents a state of affairs, not much unlike our own times; for you will find in him Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Quarrels concerning Religion, not much unlike those in our days.</hi> Thus far goes <hi>Justus Lipsius</hi> in his Accounts of this Authour. But then there are some Men of great skill in History, who have some scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples concerning the fidelity of this <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi>

of those things that were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd; From their Panegyrick Orations and Homilies: and especially from the Acts of the Councils; and from their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles which were written to divers Men, and upon different occasions: And in the last place, from those ancient Histories which were left to us, and had escaped the common Ruine of former times; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet extant, though not in any great numbers, yet either intire, or reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Epitomes; a rich, and as far as was possible splendid Collection of Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.

                  <hi>Isaac Casaubon</hi> acknowledgeth, that the things which are wanting in several Parts of that most excellent Work, are many in number.

Men, has been very usefull to the Christian World. And that it is a Work worthy of all praise and commendation.</hi> Nor doth he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his mind here rashly; but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately subjoins many reasons, some of which I willingly annex here in his own most ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant words.</p>

                  <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>this work represents the Effigies of the Ancient Christian Church, expresseth her Manners, and declares her Faith: then it shews the Apostolical Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons throughout the Church; and notes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress and spreading of the Doctrine; and it observeth also the defects, spots, and the</hi>

These and many other such like most usefull things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay scattered up and down here and there, like the Ruines of a great building; or the Limbs of a torn Body, they recollected and laid together, that they might be seen at once. Which labour of theirs is both worthy of praise and acceptance, and also attended with a general utility and advantage. And so those things, which before were to be sought for in Labyrinths, and I know not how many wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and almost infinite Circuits, which lying dispersed, torn and lacerated here and there, offered themselves now in one place, and then in another, as occasion served; and were to be inquired after with great labour and pains, which was not alwayes successfull neither; All these things</hi> (I say) <hi>being now disposed

into order, and put in certain and known places, and by the light of that method and disposition, rendered more commendable; may now be found, by a mean industry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do, as it were, present themselves to the eyes of all Men, and without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty attend their service, and wait upon their present occasions.</hi> Thus far has he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the <hi>Centuriators,</hi> and their most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Work.</p>

Church into one continued series of years, <note place="margin">In Prole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gom. ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitat.</note> with the same facility, as if he had wrote the Chronicle of some one City. For he is the Man who first brought to light, I know not from whence, so many things which were utterly unknown before; who with so accurate a diligence, explain'd the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of the most ancient Bishops in the great Cities; the rises, progress and ends of the ancient Heresies; And the Turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Peaceable times of the Church. <hi>who</hi> (if he had not abated his own merit, by his excessive partiality) <hi>was, without all controversie, worthy to have had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference before all the ancient and modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who never were able to attain that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Learning he had,</hi> as the famous <hi>Casaubon</hi> writes of him: nor is he alone in this high <hi>Encomium</hi> on him. The greatest part of the Learned Men, who deserve to be the <hi>Censors</hi> of other Mens Labours, do exactly agree with him, as I have said.

and compassion which he every where pursues, and too too much cherishes in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (for the interests of the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> had been abated; for it cannot be denied (which Learned Men blame in him) that he is so totally taken up with the defence and commendation of those whom he sides with, that all the instances that now are, or heretofore were extant in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of deserting, or corrupting the Faith, or depraving the ancient manners, of the most leud sales of holy things, and of the most execrable Sacrileges: whatever has been insolently perpetrated, of which sort we may find many examples, acted by most wicked Popes, with insufferable boldness to the prejudice of the Name of Christianity, to the dishonour of the Church, and in contempt of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> (which the greatest Catholicks will not deny, but rather acknowledge them to be Monsters of Men, and the very shames of Humanity) yet all these he excuseth; and this is little too, for he defends them; and which is yet worse, he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times commends them, and with much Oratory adorns and extolls these Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies. He doth not endeavour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the present Manners of <hi>Rome</hi> by the ancient, but by violence draws the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Antiquity against her will; and, in despite of her reluctance, by the very Throat, to countenance their City Faith;

And in the self-same manner it is necessary for the Reader of Histories to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:66025:174"/>
have the faculty of Apprehending whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Examples he Reads, and judging well of them: And then, that he should have an inclination and propensity of Mind to follow what is Good, and to shun and avoid what is Evil: and of turning all he meets with to his use and advantage. <hi>For the principal end of History is Practice, and not Knowledge or Contemplation.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must learn, not onely that we may know, but that we may doe well and live honestly.

               <argument>
                  <p>The Opinion of <hi>Keckerman</hi> defended. That Tongues are hardly to be well-learned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Rules. That there is a vast difference betwixt Languages and Actions. That Practick Philosophy is necessary, not onely to the Writer, but Reader also of History. <hi>Ubertus Folietta, Sebastianus Foxius,</hi> and <hi>Viperanus,</hi> do all seem to be of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And the most Learned <hi>Vossius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self affords us no infirm arguments to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt may we have the <hi>liberty</hi> of this Great Man (whose judgment is every where else of the greatest Authority with us, and whom, in the things relating to History, we especially value and venerate) to dissent, and in some sort to defend the part <hi>Keckerman</hi> hath taken. It seems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to me, that <hi>Keckerman</hi> may thus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, In the first place it is not impossible to learn Languages without Rules; but that they may be as well Learned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Rules is denied. We learn to Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate words, and to form, compound and speak them, by Hearing, Use and Discourse, without Precepts or Rules. But then to Adorn our Speech, and artificially form an Oration, is scarce, or rather not at all possible, without the assistance of Rules and Precepts. And besides, although one
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:66025:176"/>
may learn to speak (of what Language soever he were) without Rules, yet he will never be able to judge of the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and propriety of Speech, and to give the reason of it, without them; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to speak well, or elegantly. But then those things are best learned, of which we have a perfect knowledge, where we can give an account of the Reason of them, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> our Master teacheth us. <note place="margin">Ethic. l. 1.</note> And besides all this, there is another judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made upon Languages, than there is upon Actions, whether we are to imitate them, or to compare them in our mind by Contemplation. Use directs and corrects our Speech; but it is the Rule and Precepts of Living well which are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our Actions. The Custome of the place <hi>(which is never fix'd)</hi> governs our <note place="margin">Seneca <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</hi> 114.</note> Language: But then we know our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be temper'd, with respect to Honesty and Turpitude, and to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by the Precepts of Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Neither is the opinion of <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> altogether to be approved, in that he holds, that <hi>Practick Philosophy</hi> is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a Writer, but not for a Reader of History. For why not? Do we not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the same end is common to both of them? the design of the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he may from examples learn the way of Living well; the other's, that he may also by Examples teach that way: Is it not the scope of the one, that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:66025:177"/>
the Accidents that have attended the Lives of others, he may insinuate wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into Men? And is it not the scope of the other, that by reading and observing those events, he may attain to prudence? It seems to be exactly thus to me at least; and not to me onely, but to many others, and those not unlearned men. If you please, let us hear one or two of them. <hi>Moral Philosophy and History</hi> (saith Ubertus <note place="margin">De scriben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da Hist. penult. p. 954.</note> Folietta) <hi>are two faculties which respect the common Good and Utility of Men; and which direct them in the way to a blessed life; and fit them for the preserving and improving Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society: And therefore these two facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have divided this work between them, so that the first forms the Minds and Manners of Men by Disputes and Precepts; and the latter by usefull Examples and salutary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, teaching and advising them what to follow, and what to flee in the course of their lives: by whose Examples Men should govern and form their Actions and Counsels; and sets before them the ends and events which usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wait upon good and evil Counsels; by the knowledge of which, Men may be engaged in the love of Vertue, or call'd off from Lewd and Wicked courses. Sebastian Fox</hi> also, a Man of a celebrated judgment and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in his time, doth manifestly dissent from the great <hi>Vossius</hi> in this point. For he in his Book <hi>de Institutione Historiae,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 819.</note> writes thus. <hi>How shall you ever be able to know or judge of the Art or Elegance, not
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:66025:177"/>
onely of an History, but of any other thing that is well written; if you know not what that art is, or what is rightly and well done? those things you inquire of are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, but by Learned and well-instructed Men; for he that would accurately read a History, must first know how it ought to be wrote,</hi> &amp;c. and presently after he subjoins the reason. Because Artificers and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, and not the ignorant and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, are able to know what is Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and Learned. <hi>And therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>let Reading be attended not onely with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but also with an acquired judgment, and with an erudition that is not mean or common.</hi> Nor does <hi>Johannes Viperanus</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Scr. Hist. c. 17.</note> from <hi>Fox,</hi> as these his words demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate (who was also a Man of good Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.) <hi>It is</hi> (saith he) <hi>the work of a great Man, to collect by his reading the true fruits of History; that is, of one who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Divine and Humane reasons of things; who can cull out the best instructions of Manners, who measures the Actions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the same rules of Honesty by which he lives himself, who is well acquainted with places; who has a strange knowledge both of virtues and vices, and in whom there are great treasures of Learning and Erudition,</hi> &amp;c. and a little after this. <hi>He that can join the Precepts of Morality with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, shall reap great advantages from the reading of Histories, and shall thereby attain to perfect and absolute wisedom.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:66025:178"/>
Yea, the very Conclusion which the <note place="margin">Ars Histo. c. 5. p. 28.</note> Learned <hi>Vossius</hi> makes (in the said Fifth Chapter) concerning the principal use of History, seems to be of great force, for the confirming our opinion; for thus he writes. <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>we must thus determine, that the very principal fruit of History is to collect from Similars and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, what is expedient for the Publick, and for every Person in Particular: for he that will be wise, must be carefull to observe, or as the</hi> Greeks <hi>express it, be</hi>

                  </gap>, that is, a person that dwells upon, and deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects any thing. Which because Children and Ignorant Men can never doe, they must of necessity want the principal fruit of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Histories, from whence it may more than probably be concluded, that they are less fitted (than others) to be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Histories. Yet I will not deny, but that Children, and Men of little or no Learning, may reap some small advantage from the Reading of Histories; that is, Pleasure and Delight; or may perhaps, by remembring some pretty Stories, please others by the handsome telling them (if they be persons of more than ordinary natural wit and ingenuity, and have the Knack of expressing a thing well and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly, which yet is very rarely found in a very tender and immature Age.) But then as the same <hi>Vossius</hi> observes, <hi>They are to be esteem'd a sort of ridiculous silly</hi>

                     <hi>Vossius</hi> his third Argument against <hi>Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> doth hardly seem to be strong.

ought to remember, that <hi>Antiquity esteem'd these sorts of History as but little better than fables</hi> (I use <hi>Vossius</hi> his own words) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause from such Accounts there was little other advantages to be reaped besides those of Pleasure, no more than there was from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi> But the Reader we are now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ought to look beyond these things: for our end is not Pleasure, but improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that which is the ultimate end of all Histories, that he may be taught to live well, and happily.

               <p>Has its place, not onely in Philosophy, but in the Writer and Reader of an History; and at last, about the end of that Chapter, he concludes thus; <hi>And in truth, if the Causes, Counsels and Manners of Actions are omitted, there is rather a Fable told, for the entertainment of Children, than an History written for the use of Men, as</hi> Sempronius Assellio <hi>saith in</hi>

Do illiterate and ignorant Men inquire after these secrets? Or to what end should they be taught them, if they are not able to judge of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, counsels and circumstances of Actions; or to accommodate them to their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages? some body very neatly express'd this by this simile; As Girles gather Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers onely to please their eyes and senses: Whilst <hi>Apothecaries</hi> consider the health of, Men and Medicines, and to that purpose
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:66025:180"/>
onely, collect the Leaves, Flowers, Roots, and smallest Fibers of Plants; so Children play with Histories, as they do with Tops and Chess; and when they see or hear of any great Actions, rejoice at them as new and strange things, or are affrighted at them; but then those that are a little versed in Arts, and adorn'd with something of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and judgment, will in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of History, pass by very few things without observing them. These onely use to reflect on the Divine Institutions, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Humane Law, to weigh all Counsels, and note all Events; and with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and pleasure, to refer all Domestick, Publick, Warlike, or Peaceable Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Events, to the use of Civil Society and Prudence: And this with <hi>Keckerman</hi> is to reade Histories; and such a Reader he requires, to wit (that I may use his own words) <hi>One whose business it is to reade, and observe Ethick, Domestick and Politick exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, with the greatest care imaginable. But then</hi> (saith he) <hi>whoever shall attempt this before he understands the method of Moral, Oeconomick and Politick Precepts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may very justly be taken for an absurd person.</hi>

                  <p>The Argument Borrowed from <hi>Quintilian</hi> consider'd, and an Answer made to it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the last place, the passage cited out of <hi>Quintillian</hi> seems not to <hi>me</hi> to be of any force against the opinion of <hi>Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> Because it is apparent, <hi>Quintillian</hi> is onely there teaching, by what Authours the <hi>Styles</hi> of Children may be best form'd. And that by the conduct and assistence of the Master of Rhetorick, or Tutor, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by the private reading of the Scholar himself. For, Chapter the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, he saith, <hi>It will be of great advantage to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. Orat.</note> 
                  <hi>if the Schoolmaster enlighten their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings more, by the reading of Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than of Histories.</hi> And there present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shews excellently what is the duty of the Rhetorician on this account. But then in the VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, which is cited by <hi>Vossius,</hi> he shews more fully, what choice of Authours should be made: <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>without prudent election, it will be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to take any Authour; the best and most candid, who have a lovely Copia and Clearness, such as</hi> Livy <hi>and</hi> Cicero <hi>are, ought to be chosen,</hi> as he thinks. And then he shews what Authours ought at first to be avoided, which yet when they have attain'd a firmness and maturity of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may safely be allowed them. We
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:66025:181"/>
answer then, that it is quite another thing to form a <hi>Style</hi> or <hi>Language;</hi> or as <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> expresseth it, to Polish the <hi>Phrase</hi> of a Person; and to gather, note and lay up seriously, and professedly, <hi>Moral, Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick,</hi> and <hi>Politick Examples,</hi> that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may thereby be enabled to act prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to form his Life by the Rules of Vertue. Now the first of these was the whole design of <hi>Quintilian;</hi> the latter was no part of his thoughts. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he recommends the reading of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the young Rhetoricians: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps also the Discourses of Historians are by him more regarded than their Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; because in them he affirms <hi>Livy</hi> to excell. For he saith, that <hi>He is of a very</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quint.</hi> l. 10. c. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>great sweetness and candor in his relations; But in his harangues or speeches more elegant than can be express'd.</hi> But now if any Man thinks otherwise, and will needs believe, that the design of the Oratour there, is to exercise his young Scholars with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of things; and that he designs to furnish him with Examples <hi>(which are in every kind the most Powerfull of all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)</hi> and which he may afterwards apply, as occasion shall require: then we answer in the second place, that <hi>Quintilian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this to be done, by the conduct, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and judgment of the <hi>Master of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick;</hi> whose business he makes it to shew, the <hi>excellencies and faults, not onely of the Language and Phrase, but also of what is
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:66025:181"/>
done or spoken,</hi> as you may reade, <hi>Lib. 2. Chap.</hi> 5. And now if the Master goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, illustrates and unfolds the Authour, who can doubt that Historians may not be of great use to Children of no great age? and yet even there, in the opinion of <hi>Quintilian, the most easie and plain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,</hi> such as <hi>Titus Livius</hi> is esteem'd to be, are to be preferr'd; and yet even here too, for the intire understanding of him, he conceives a good proficiency is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as he saith in his VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

               <head>SECT. V.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Opinion of <hi>Simon Grynaeus</hi> on this account Approved; and it is more largely shewn who is a competent or well qualified Reader. It is at least requisite that the Reader have a taste of Moral Philosophy. And also of <hi>Chronology</hi> and <hi>Geography,</hi> which are the two Eyes of History. And some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of other Arts is also necessary.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AND therefore I should rather chuse to hear <hi>Simon Grynaeus,</hi> and be of his mind, who Exhorting the Readers of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, bespeaks them in this manner: <hi>It befits a man</hi> (saith he) <hi>to come so much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter provided to the Reading of History, because it is replenished with great plenty and variety of excellent fruits. And seeing it is attended with the same difficulty to judge well of ones own as of another's life; Nor can any man rightly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Life of another man (though we are all wonderfully quick-sighted there,) who cannot prudently govern his own, it follows that there is great difficulty on both sides, and that many things are required before we undertake that work, and that we ought not onely to be tinctured with Civil prudence, but also to be fix'd as to the purpose and course of our lives, unless we are willing to Roll up and down, and be for ever led by vain and deceivable Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:66025:182"/>
And therefore we (to conclude this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) say in the first place, that it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary that the Reader of Histories be studious and diligent, serious and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, constant and steady. Whereupon <hi>Quintilian</hi> thus speaketh. <hi>For a great while</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 10. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>none but the best, and such as will not deceive a man are to be read, and that with the diligence and care almost of a Writer; nor is it enough to re-examine the Authour again by parts onely, but the whole book is intirely to be read over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain attentively and seriously,</hi> &amp;c. for as one said well of old, <hi>Whether thou readest any thing thy self, or hearest another, let not thy mind wander, but force it to dwell there, and to do the business in hand, and not other things: for you may be assured you lose both your time and your pains, if you do not</hi> (seriously) <hi>attend what you reade or hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, Let the Reader be <hi>constant and steady</hi> in his Readings, for a constant and certain way of Reading is advantageous, for the desultory and running way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding affords small improvement. Let us hear <hi>Seneca</hi> in this point: <hi>If you will</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Lib. 1. ep. 2.</note> he) <hi>carry any thing along with you, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to stay upon and be nourished with some certain and fixed Authours, which may seat themselves in your mind so as not to be easily lost.</hi> And therefore <hi>Stephanus Praetorius</hi> gives <note place="margin">Tract. de Form. Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis, p. 31.</note> here very good advice. <hi>Let young men</hi> (saith he) <hi>remember not to desert the Reading of any Book before they have read it through and do clearly understand it; for some are so delicate,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:66025:183"/>
or soft and nice in their Reading of Authours, that when they have privately taken a Book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, and run over two or three Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, presently they lay that by and begin to reade another Book, and so never go through with any thing. Now this</hi> nice <hi>way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, though a man be very diligent at it, yet as to the gaining any true and solid Learning, it is of No use at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place we approve our Reader so much the more if he has had a taste of Practick Philosophy or <hi>Morality,</hi> the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of which qualification may be easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by what is said above. In the next place, if he has some degree, at least of knowledge in <hi>Chronology,</hi> that is the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions <note place="margin">Chronology.</note> of Times and Ages: So that he is acquainted with the Series and Order of them, and can inclose as it were in certain Limits, the Empires, Wars and Events he meets with in History. That great Man <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus Scaliger</hi> calls this the <hi>Soul of History, without which it cannot breathe</hi> or live: by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it is call'd the <hi>Right Eye</hi> of History: by others the <hi>North Star,</hi> which governs and directs the Reader whilst he Sails on the vast <hi>Ocean</hi> of History, that he may the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and quickly, and with the greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and improvement arrive at the <hi>Port</hi> he designs by his Reading; for he that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Order of times thinks he may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Histories, will find himself in the end as much disappointed, as if he should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:66025:183"/>
to pass the Windings of a great <hi>Labyrinth</hi> without a Thread or Conductor.</p>
               <p>But we attribute to History a left Eye too, that is <hi>Geography</hi> or <hi>Topography,</hi> with <note place="margin">Geography.</note> which, if the Reader be not in some degree acquainted, he must of necessity lose much of the pleasure, yea and of the advantage or utility of his Reading, and will scarce be able to attain a clear and perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the things related. For who is so ignorant in History as not to understand how much light is given to the Reader by the circumstances of the place in which any thing is done? Let him therefore be Master of the Common Divisions of the Globe of the Earth; and let him know how to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the Parts of the World, and how they lye; Let him also know the Provinces or Kingdoms in each part, and at least the Principal Rivers, Mountains and Towns; for as to the more exact knowledge of small things, we hardly judge it necessary to our Reader. Lastly, If he be in some degree also acquainted with other Arts, and has some experience of things, we shall then say that he is indeed <hi>a competent and well-prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Reader of History.</hi> And these things are sufficient to be spoken concerning the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of our Method.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE third Head yet remains, which in the beginning we resolved to treat of in the last place; and that was, what in our
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:66025:185"/>
Readings we should elect, and how. And this I might easily pass over if I did onely propose the Rules <hi>Ludovicus Vivis</hi> has given to be observed by all. For he teacheth us what is to be observed in the Reading Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, in these words. <hi>In Reading Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> (saith he) <hi>the first thing to be observed is the Order of times, and in the next place all Words and Actions which will afford any exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the imitating what is good, or the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding what is evil. Wars and Fights are not so accurately to be considered as teaching us nothing but the arts and ways by which we may hurt one another; it is also lightly to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded who took Arms, who were the Generals, where they fought, who was beaten, and what was done to them; nor are these things to be read or written in any other style than that of Great</hi> ROBBERIES, <hi>as indeed for the most part they are no better, excepting onely those Wars which are begun against Thieves, which I wish were more usually done amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; it will therefore be better and much more fruitfull to fix our minds upon the affairs of the Gown, and to Note what things are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously and wisely done in relation to any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; what is basely and cruelly done as to vices; what event followed; how happy the ends of good Actions proved; how sad and calamitous those of leud Actions: Then the Speeches and Replies of men of great Sense, Experience and Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and especially those which according to the Greek word are call'd</hi> Apophthegms. <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels also, and the Causes why any thing was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:66025:185"/>
done or spoken, and especially the Counsels of such men as have excell'd others in Honesty, Wisedom and Learning; as for example the Philosophers, and the best of Men the Saints of our Religion; that we may not onely know what has proceeded from great agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of minds, but what hath come calmly from the force of the mind and judgment; for indeed it is an unworthy thing to commit to writing the Operations of our affections, and not those of our Reason and Counsels.</hi> These Prescriptions are given us by that Learned <hi>Spaniard.</hi> It would be a shorter work yet if I should onely propose to our Student in History the Example of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> for his imitation, of whom <hi>Suetonius</hi> writes thus. <hi>In perusing</hi>

                  <hi>the</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Latine <hi>Histories, he did not pursue any thing so much as the Collecting those Precepts or Examples which were salutary and usefull to the Publick or to private men; which transcribing word for word, he very often sent to his Domesticks, or to the Governours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, or Armies, or to the Magistrates of the City, as any of them had need of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.</hi> But we shall make the Use of Histories a little larger, and yet shall not be over prolix neither. For as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served above frequently and truly, History is a treasury of very many and different good things: For in History you will find some things which tend to the increase of Learning, others of Prudence, other things you may observe which tend to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:66025:186"/>

Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> was a perpetual mover of its Ruine, who died that year <hi>Lucius Censorinus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Manlius</hi> were Consuls. In the same year <hi>Carthage</hi> was destroyed by <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio: Lucius Mummius</hi> totally Rased to the ground <hi>Corinth,</hi> 952 years after it was built, by <hi>Aletes</hi> the Son of <hi>Hippotis.</hi> Both Generals were honoured with the Names of the Nations they had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered; one of them being call'd <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> and the other <hi>Achaicus.</hi> Nor did any <hi>New-Man,</hi> before <hi>Mummius,</hi> obtain a Sirname by his Valour. The Manners of the two Generals were very different, and their Studies contrary; for <hi>Scipio</hi> was so great a Lover, and Advancer of Learning, and all sorts of Erudition and Elegance, that he ever kept with him <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius</hi> and <hi>Panaetius</hi> (two Men of great Ingenuity) both at home in times of Peace, and abroad in times of War: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did any Man divide the intervals of his business with greater Art than <hi>Scipio:</hi> for he was always employ'd in the Arts of War or Peace; being ever handling his Books or Arms, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:66025:189"/>
his Body in Martial dangers, or his Mind in Learned Sciences. <hi>Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi> on the other side, was so extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ignorant, that when he was bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the transportation of the Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Statues which had been made by the best of the Ancient Artificers in both kinds, into <hi>Italy,</hi> he caus'd the Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors to be told, That if they suffered them to be lost, they should pay for the new making them. And yet, <hi>O Vinici,</hi> (saith <hi>Vellejus)</hi> I do not doubt but you will think, it had been more for the interest of the Commonwealth, that we had still remain'd thus ignorant of these <hi>Corinthian</hi> Works, rather than to have overvalued them as now we do; and that this folly of his was more consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the Publick Good than our skill.</q> Thus runs the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the first Book of <hi>Vellejus Paterculus:</hi> in which there are many things worthy of a <hi>Philologer</hi>'s observation. As first the time when the great <hi>Censor, Cato,</hi> died, for we should ever think the Births and Deaths of Great Men worthy of our observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But then how great a Man this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> was, may be known from the three-fold Elogie attributed to him by <hi>Pliny</hi> the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; <note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 27.</note> for thus he writes of him. Cato, <hi>the first of the</hi> Porcian <hi>Family, is thought to have attain'd three of the greatest things a Man is capable of, being an excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, a great Oratour, and a wise Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:66025:190"/>
And there is a noble Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him in <hi>Livy</hi> his History, which <note place="margin">Li. 39. c. 40.</note> you may see: the year of his death also is set down, which was the 604<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which <hi>L. Marcius Censorinus,</hi> and <hi>M. Manlius</hi> were Consuls, three years before the Rasing of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which <hi>Cato</hi> so eagerly desired, and which happened in the IIId year of the CLVIII <hi>Olympiad;</hi> if we follow truth, and the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertor of it <hi>Eusebius;</hi> that is, according to the computation of <hi>Scaliger, Anno Mundi</hi> 3804. As concerning the Age of <hi>Cato,</hi> there is a small disagreement betwixt <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> and <hi>Titus Livy;</hi> for the first of these saith he lived to the XC. year of his Age, <note place="margin">Cicero <hi>in</hi> Catone <hi>Maj.</hi> Livius, <hi>l. 39. c.</hi> 40.</note> and the latter seemeth to say, that he did not survive the LXXXV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Life.</p>
               <p>Nor is it to be passed by without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that he was a perpetual instigator of the Ruine of <hi>Carthage,</hi> as is affirm'd by <hi>Vellejus,</hi> with whom <hi>Florus</hi> doth agree in this particular. <hi>Cato</hi> (saith he) <hi>ever</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 15. Vide <hi>Cic.</hi> in <hi>Cat.</hi> Majore. It is very Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that from the Ruine of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the Civil Wars of <hi>Rome</hi> took their Rise, which ended in the Ruine of the <hi>Roman Commonwealth,</hi> as is observed by the great Historian <hi>Salustius,</hi> in his Preface to the <hi>Catiline</hi> Conspiracy. And in <hi>Utica,</hi> a Town belonging to <hi>Carthage, Cato Minor,</hi> the last Great Man of this Name, perished in those Wars. God punishing the jealousie and perfidy of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable hatred of this Great Man, by their own Methods; to teach all States and Princes, the folly of such fine-spun, but unjust Politicks.</note> 
                  <hi>pronounced, with an implacable hatred, that</hi> Carthage <hi>was to be Rased, even then, when he gave his opinion in any other case what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever:
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:66025:190"/>
and</hi> Scipio Nasica, <hi>that it was to be preserved.</hi> But then this consideration is rather <hi>Philosophical,</hi> or <hi>Political,</hi> and belongs to another place, where the causes of these contrary Advices are to be enquired into, and which of them was the more prudent.</p>
               <p>In the second place, the <hi>Philologer</hi> will observe the Age and duration of the City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the time in which it was built: for it continued, saith the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, 952 years. And it was destroyed in the same year with <hi>Carthage;</hi> that is, in the year of <hi>Rome 607. Anno Mundi</hi> 3804. therefore it was built <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2852. about 300 years before the Olympiads, in which time <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet and Judge of <hi>Israel</hi> flourished. In the third place, he will observe not onely when, but who was the Builder of this City; <hi>Vellejus</hi> tells us, it was <hi>Aletes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hippotis. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus Scaliger,</hi> in his <hi>Eusebian</hi> Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, <note place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> saith, that <hi>Vellejus</hi> trifles here; for <hi>Apollodorus</hi> saith, it was first call'd <hi>Ephyra,</hi> and that it was built by one <hi>Sisyphus,</hi> who lived about 60 or 70 years before the times of the <hi>Trojane</hi> Wars. And that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Origine</hi> of this City was to be placed much higher. But <hi>Pausanias</hi> saith, the Name was changed in honour of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Jove.</hi> And that some Generations after that, <hi>Aletes,</hi> the Great Grandchild of <hi>Hercules,</hi> led an Army of the <hi>Doricks</hi> against the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that Kingdom, which his Posterity
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:66025:191"/>
(as <hi>Pausanias</hi> saith) enjoyed after this, five Generations. In the Fourth place he will observe, that this Age was, in a sort, fatal to great Cities. For to speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Saguntum, Syracuse, Numantia,</hi> and others; besides those two Eyes (as <note n="*" place="margin">De Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Deor. <hi>l.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> calls them) of the Sea-shore, <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> which were both put out in one year: <hi>Thebes</hi> in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> and <hi>Chalcis</hi> in <hi>Euboea,</hi> were both taken by the <hi>Romans,</hi> oppress'd, subverted and ruin'd. Whence the Philosopher concludes, that Cities and Commonwealths have their Periods and Determin'd times, and much more Men. But then this consideration which this <note place="margin">Vide <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coe,</hi> Epist. 92.</note> place affords, is Moral too as well as the former; that is, that Periods of VII hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, have, for the most part, brought great changes to Kingdoms, and Common-wealths. Of which you may see more in <hi>Bodinus</hi> his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book <hi>de Repub.</hi> and <hi>Peuce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus de divinatione, lib.</hi> VI. <hi>Of which Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>there was an ill use made in the time of the Holy League in</hi> France, <hi>as</hi> Thuanus <hi>acquaints us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> place, whereas he saith, the two <hi>Generals, Mummius</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> were honoured with the Names of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they had Conquered, and the latter was call'd <hi>Africanus,</hi> and the former <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaicus;</hi> from hence, I say, we may observe the Ancient Custome of giving Sir names, and the reason of it both amongst the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi> for they took them
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:66025:191"/>
from their Actions, from the shapes of their Bodies, from some peculiar Vertue or Vice, and from some notable Accident or Fortune: So <hi>Tarquinius</hi> the Second was Sirnamed <hi>Superbus</hi> the <hi>Proud,</hi> from his Pride and Contempt of others. <hi>C. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> from the taking of <hi>Coriola,</hi> was call'd <hi>Coriolanus; Manlius</hi> was call'd <hi>Torquatus,</hi> because he slew a <hi>Gall</hi> in a Duel, who challeng'd him, and took a Chain from him, and put it about his own neck. So the Sir-names of 1. <hi>Soteris, 2. Callinicus,</hi> and 3. <hi>Gryphus,</hi> signifie the first to have been a <hi>Saviour,</hi> the second to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a <hi>glorious Victory,</hi> and the third to have had a <hi>Hooked,</hi> or <hi>Roman Nose</hi> (as we call it) of which you may see <hi>Appian A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus</hi> in his Preface. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander ab Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9. And from hence also some <hi>Political</hi> observations might be raised, which I will for the present omit.</p>
               <p>In the VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi> place the <hi>Philologer</hi> will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve from this remark, that <hi>Mummius</hi> was the first of the <hi>New Men,</hi> who me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited a Sir-name by his Valour; that the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens were discriminate into three orders, the <hi>Nobles, the New Men,</hi> and the <hi>Ignobles</hi> (or <hi>Plebeians:)</hi> for those who had the <hi>Images</hi> of their Ancestours, were <hi>Nobles;</hi> those who had onely their own Statues, were <hi>New Men;</hi> and they who had neither, were call'd <hi>Ignobles.</hi> And
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:66025:192"/>
now in the remainder of this Chapter, is contain'd the comparing of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Mummius;</hi> in which is initated, both their Manners, Tempers and Orders, or ways of Living; all which, together with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations which spring from thence, are to be referred to the other head of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical Observations, to which they are here to be left: But then as to the Critick Observations, if there be any, they are not to be omitted: for all these, and whatever concerns <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and all other observations of the like nature, do belong to Philologie: and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not here forbear shewing, that I do whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissent from <hi>Justus Lipsius,</hi> the Prince of Criticks, who will not allow <hi>Scipio</hi> to be call'd here <hi>[omnis doctrinae Auctor;] An Improver of all sorts of Learning. For,</hi> (saith he) <hi>this is too great a Commendation for</hi> Scipio, <hi>and therefore I would write onely</hi> [Fautor] <hi>A favourer; for that better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits a Great, and a Military Man:</hi> to which I reply <hi>(O Lipsius!)</hi> there is no need of a change here: For it was well deserved by him, because he (with a very few others) is reported to have first brought all sorts of Learning into the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> And why may we not conjecture, that <hi>Polybius</hi> wrote his History, and <hi>Panaetius</hi> his Books of <hi>Offices,</hi> at the instigation of <hi>Scipio?</hi> Will any Man say, that this conjecture is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, when <hi>Vellejus</hi> himself writes they were his perpetual Companions? and when
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:66025:192"/>
also the writings of <hi>Terence</hi> are ascribed to <hi>Scipio,</hi> as <hi>Fabius</hi> testifieth? and when <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> saith, there is a strong report that <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> was assisted by <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Scipio;</hi> to which may be added what <hi>Vellejus</hi> subjoins here. <hi>[Whenever he obtain'd any respit from the Affairs of the State and Camp, he exercised his mind in Learning:]</hi> for from this very passage, that Praise of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s is made more probable, and indeed is not to be thought too great, as <hi>Lipsius</hi> thinketh. Nor is this Elogy too great neither for a <hi>great or a Military Man.</hi> For you see what <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> or <hi>Aemilius Pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>us</hi> say of <hi>Hannibal; This Great Man</hi> (saith that Authour) <hi>though he were distracted with such great Wars, spent some part of his time in Learning; for there are some Books extant which he wrote in</hi> Greek: <hi>and in those to the</hi> Rhodians <hi>he writes the History of the Actions of</hi> Cn. Manlius Vulso <hi>in</hi> Asia. And,</p>
               <p>In the last place, the <hi>Philologer</hi> will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Elegance and Propriety of his words, his ingenious Allusions, and his apt and clear Translations, as in these words; <hi>Neque enim quisquam hoc</hi> Scipione <hi>Eleganti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us intervalla negotiorum dispunxit.</hi> For whether he alluded to that of <hi>Cato,</hi> in the beginning of his <hi>Origins,</hi> where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>That there ought to be an account gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not onely of the Actions of Famous and very Great Men, but also how they spent their times of leisure and repose:</hi> or whether he
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:66025:193"/>
reflects upon that expression of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, when he said, <hi>Se nunquam minus otiosum esse, quam cum otiosus; neque minus solum quam cum solus esset. That he was never less idle</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicer.</hi> de Off. lib. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>than when he seemed to be so; nor less alone, than when he was so.</hi> Now <hi>Vellejus</hi> seems to me to have here very elegantly taken in, and expressed both these Elogies. Which that it may more clearly appear, the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger</hi> will observe, that there is a two-fold leisure opposed to business and labour; one of which is perfect sloth and idleness, without any action; the other is very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. And this place, saith <hi>Scipio,</hi> was ever for the latter sort; for in his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and times of rest, he was never care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of the Publick Affairs, nor gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up to idleness; but either thought of his business, or entertained himself with Books, or the conversations of wise Men. For this is the meaning of that phrase <hi>(In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervalla negotiorum, otio dispungere.)</hi> The last word of which is borrowed from the usage of Men concerned in pecuniary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and accountants, as the <hi>Philologer</hi> will presently observe. And signifies the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing or comparing what is <hi>received</hi> with what is <hi>paid:</hi> for so saith <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib. 56. D.</hi> de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum sign. <hi>L.</hi> 6. D. de stat.</note>

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:66025:193"/>
                  <hi>Vellejus</hi> is here to be understood, as if he had thus expressed himself. <hi>No man did ever balance his Publick Employments more exactly with his private studies, comparing them each with the other, with the same care as an Accomptant would do the sum received with that which was paid.</hi> For you must know, that what was approved or allowed on both sides, in giving their Votes, or in calling over their Souldiers or Officers, was usually marked with pricks, that so they might proceed to examine the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder. And these things were said to be <hi>dispuncta, pricked</hi> or <hi>crossed</hi> out. And on the contrary, what were passed by, or rejected, and to be refused, were said to be <hi>expuncta, marked</hi> or <hi>branded:</hi> and so discar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Souldiers were styl'd <hi>expuncti.</hi> In short, the Authour seems to speak as if he would have said, <hi>No Man ever took more care, that both his employments and retirements should be alike usefull and salutary.</hi> And let thus much suffice concerning what may be ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>served upon the XIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the first Book of <hi>Vellejus Paterculus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I promised another Example on this Head of <hi>Philologie,</hi> and I will be as good as my word: but then I have resolved to be as short in this second, as I have been long in the first. <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> in the IIId Book of his Annals, and 65<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, shall be the Subject of it.

               <argument>
                  <p>What Method is to be observed in Philosophical Observations shewn out of <hi>Herodotus, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius,</hi> and other Historians. A twofold use of Examples. <hi>Justus Lipsius, Jo. à cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kier</hi> and <hi>R. Dallington</hi> our Countreyman have excellently shewn the Uses of Histories and Examples. An Instance or two of which is here given by us out of <hi>L. Florus, Justin</hi> and <hi>Herodotus.</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> supposeth that the History of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> is true. What use may be made of it. The faith of <hi>Camillus</hi> and <hi>Fabricius,</hi> and the Axioms which spring from it. What the Prodigious Preparations of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and the Event of his Expedition may teach us, which is again confirm'd by the Example of the last <hi>Darius.</hi> By the Examples of <hi>Caligula, Nero</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> the Malignity of self love, envy, and spite, and malice are shewn. <hi>Polybius</hi> frequently shews the Use of Histories.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AND now in the gathering Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Observations, the Reader should observe this Rule, That is not onely to Observe, Extract and Compare all the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Politick, Oeconomick</hi> and <hi>Military</hi> Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which he meets in Histories, and to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them together, but also to do this in such manner, as that he may prudently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate them to the Laws and Rules of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:66025:196"/>
Life, and the Principles of Art; according to that of <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The Stone is to be brought to the Rule, and not the Rule to the Stone.</hi> The Authours themselves do frequently do this. <hi>Herodotus</hi> refers the whole History of the <hi>Trojan War</hi> to the Common Rule of Justice, saying, <hi>There are great Punishments inflicted by God for great Injuries.</hi> And so <hi>Polybius</hi> from the Example of <hi>M. Attilius</hi> gives us this caution, <hi>That we ought to distrust for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and especially after great prosperities.</hi> Because <hi>Attilius Regulus,</hi> who but a little before would allow no place for Mercy, and would not on any terms afford the afflicted <hi>Carthaginians</hi> a pardon, was soon after taken and enforced to supplicate them for his own life. And in the same place he shews the expression of <hi>Euripides</hi> was verified, <hi>That one good counsel may overcome a great many Souldiers.</hi> And this he saith also was strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved true by the Example of <hi>Xantippus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> who alone by one Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence conquered and defeated the <hi>Roman</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, which were before thought invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and insuperable; restor'd the City when it was almost ready to perish, and revived the dejected minds of his Countreymen.</p>
               <p>That the Reader may be enabled to do this with the greater exactness, let him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Causes of every Action and Counsel; let him consider the circumstances of it, and weigh the success; and let him
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:66025:196"/>
in each of these search out wherein any thing is well or prudently, ill or imprudently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged; and let him from thence draw up to himself a general Precept, Rule or Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then prove or illustrate it with many Sentences or Examples. For there is a two-fold use of Examples: the first for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what is done by good men, and that we may learn to shun the ill actions of wicked men: The second is, that from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Stories we may deduce and extract some Sentence, which may be generally use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to us. <hi>Justus Lipsius</hi> has by a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Examples shewn the Manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Histories into use in a small piece, which he styles <hi>Monita &amp; Exempla Politica, Politick Advices and Examples. Johannes a chokier,</hi> also a Scholar of <hi>Lipsius,</hi> in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Master, put out <hi>Thesaurum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorismorum Politicorum, a Treasury of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Aphorisms,</hi> which is very full. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove XX years since the most Noble <hi>R. Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi> our Countreyman, a Man of great Name for Learning, Wisedom and Piety, exercised himself with great Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this way, in a piece he printed in the English Tongue, under the title of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Military Aphorisms.</hi> And yet may we have the Reader's leave, even here to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him with some Examples which the young Student may propose to himself as a Copy, and, if he thinks fit, imitate it.</p>
               <p>When we reade in <hi>Ann. Florus,</hi> and also <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Livius,</hi> l 1. c. 4.</note> in <hi>Titus Livius</hi> and others, that <hi>Romulus,</hi>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:66025:197"/>
the Founder both of the <hi>Roman</hi> City and Government, was the Son of an unknown Father; and together with <hi>Remus</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the Command of <hi>Amulius</hi> being cast, when an infant, into the River, he could not be destroyed. <hi>For</hi> (as <hi>Florus</hi> saith) <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Florus,</hi> l. 1. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>both</hi> Tiber <hi>restrain'd his Waves, and a Wolf having left her Whelps, and following the Cry of the Babes, gave them suck, and being so found under a Tree, the King's Shepherd car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them home and brought them up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ought from this Story to observe the wonderfull power of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the transcendent goodness of the Deity, who knows how to preserve those he intends afterwards to make use of for the effecting some great work. And from hence also ariseth this Axiome:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Foundations and Cradles of great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires are sometimes laid and preserved in small and shamefull beginnings, but by extraordinary and miraculous manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or thus: <hi>The Beginnings of great Empires, although they are often small, and in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Men, in themselves contemptible, yet they ever shew some extraordinary and peculiar Providence of God, and contain certain testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The History of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the founder of the <hi>Medio-Persick</hi> Monarchy, is extremely well known; who being expos'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Astyagis</hi> his Grandfather to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured <note place="margin">Justin. <hi>l.</hi> 1.

                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:66025:197"/>
There is a History in <hi>Justin</hi> of one <hi>Havidis</hi> a King of <hi>Gallicia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> which is no less wonderfull and amazing, which whoever has a mind to see his strange Dangers and Accidents, may reade; and he may also meet with other such-like Examples in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 12. c. 42. &amp; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex.</hi> ab <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex.</hi> l. 2. c. 31.</note> amongst his <hi>various Histories,</hi> but I must not stay. Nor let any man reply that these are <hi>Mythick Histories,</hi> made up of Truth and Fiction, seeing St. <hi>Augustine</hi> supposeth the Story of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> to be true, from whence it may not (improbably) be conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured the rest are so too. <hi>What wonder is it</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De Civitat-Dei, lib. 18. c. 21.</note> (saith he) <hi>if God to punish the King, who had cruelly commanded them to be cast into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, having first delivered those infants from the danger of drowning by his own divine power, whom he afterwards intended to employ in the building so great a City: would farther contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their preservation by the suckling them by a wild Beast?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May I have your leave to give another instance out of our Authour last mentioned, <hi>Annaeus Florus,</hi> which belongs too to this <hi>Philosophick</hi> Head. He represents the Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the <hi>Romans</hi> against the <hi>Falisci,</hi> very elegantly in these few words, but full of sense. <hi>When the</hi> Falisci <hi>were besieged by</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus, <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>the Faith of this General seemed won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, and not without good cause: for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Schoolmaster having brought their children into his Camp to betray their City to him,</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus <hi>bound him, and sent him and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren back into the City. What was the event?
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:66025:198"/>
Why the</hi> Falisci <hi>freely surrendred themselves.</hi> And we have just such another Example of a generous Faith in <hi>Fabricius,</hi> in relation to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus.</hi> I will give it you in the words of <hi>Frontinus. The Physician of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 4.</note> Pyrrhus <hi>King of</hi> Epirus <hi>came to</hi> Fabricius <hi>the</hi> Roman <hi>General, and offered to Poison</hi> Pyrrhus <hi>if he might be well paid for it. But</hi> Fabricius <hi>not thinking he stood in need of such a villany in order to the victory, discovered the Treason of the Physician to the King, and by that fidelity wrought so much upon that Prince, that he sought the friendship of the</hi> Romans.</p>
               <p>Now what use can we make of all this? why, we have a general Rule of the greatest value imaginable expressed by <hi>Florus</hi> in the former Chapter. <hi>That is to be accounted a Victory, which may be obtained with the safety of our Faith, and the preservation of our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Valerius Maximus</hi> has expressed this Rule with equal elegance; <hi>That Victory which hath most Humanity in it, will be least subject to the Envy of Gods or Men.</hi> Take the same Rule over again, expressed in other words. <hi>If any man would march the direct way to a quick Victory, let him learn to use Clemency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Enemies.</hi> For we are taught by the former Examples, and a Number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that prudent men, who are very wise, do effect more by their moderation than by force; yea those things have sometimes been done by Counsels and Moderation, which Violence despaired of: according to that of the Poet <hi>Claudian,</hi>

These very Precepts for imitating good Examples, are also to be found amongst Heathens, who observed them both in their words and actions, and did not disdain in contemplating and trying to follow the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and affections of their Ancestours; to reform their own, or to direct and moderate other mens. That great Man <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> (of whom something has been spoken already) would frequently go to the Cottage of <hi>M. Curius,</hi> which was not far from his own Estate, and having deeply considered the smallness and meanness of his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was wont to think thus with himself. <hi>This Man was the greatest of the</hi> Romans, <note place="margin">Plutarch. <hi>in</hi> Cat. Maj.</note> 
                  <hi>who having Conquered many War-like Nations, and driven</hi> Pyrrhus <hi>out of</hi> Italy, <hi>after three Triumphs digged this Field with his own hands, and dwelt in this poor Cottage: Here too, when the Ambassadours came and found him by the fires side eating a few Rape-roots out of a Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en dish for his supper, and offered him a great quantity of Gold, he sent them away with this short Answer, That he had no need of much Gold who was contented with that Supper; and that he had rather Conquer them who had Gold, than possess it. When</hi> Cato <hi>had thus considered all these things, he went away, and comparing his own Fields or Estate, Servants and way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with the other, he encreased his Labours, and cut off all Luxury. Servius Sulpitius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so will afford us a great Instance of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who that he might Consolate <hi>Cicero,</hi>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:66025:203"/>
who bitterly lamented the death of his daughter, entertain'd him with the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a certain Meditation (which would not have mis-become a Christian;) which he had once had upon the Ruine of some flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Cities, (which might seem to have been perpetual.) And thus from his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience deduced one very powerfull and rational Argument of Consolation. <hi>I will</hi> (said he) <hi>relate to you a thing which has much Consolated me, which perhaps may abate your</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicer.</hi> Ep. Fam. lib. 4. Ep. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>sorrows too. Returning out of</hi> Asia, <hi>when I sail'd from</hi> Aegina <hi>towards</hi> Megara, <hi>I began to view the Countries about me. Behind me was</hi> Aegina, <hi>before me</hi> Megara, <hi>on my right hand</hi> Periaeus, <hi>on my left</hi> Corinth, <hi>which were all in former times most flourishing Towns but now lye all before our eyes desolate and ruined: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I began to think thus with my self; Alas! shall we silly men fall into mighty passions if any of our friends dye, or is slain, whose lives are naturally short, when we see here the carcasses of so many great Cities, in a small room, lye mouldering to nothing. Wilt thou, O</hi> Servius, <hi>for the future remember that thou were born a mortal? Believe me</hi> (said he) <hi>I was strangely supported by this Consideration; now if this seems rational to you too, go and consider of it.</hi> To the same purpose does the <hi>Roman</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher <note place="margin">Epist. 92.</note> 
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> elegantly consolate his friend <hi>Liberalis,</hi> that he might soften his grief for the <hi>Lugdunensian Colony,</hi> which was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd by fire, using almost the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:66025:203"/>
                  <hi>Sulpitius</hi> did. <hi>Set before you</hi> (said he) <hi>the condition of all mankind; and let us before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand suppose, not onely how often such things have happened, but also how often they may, if we will not be oppress'd, or stick stupidly like a Ship (in the Sands) all the changes of Fortune are to be thought on. How often have the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of</hi> Asia <hi>and</hi> Achaia <hi>been ruin'd by one Earthquake? How many Towns in</hi> Syria? <hi>how many in</hi> Macedonia <hi>have been swallowed up? how often has this calamity desolated</hi> Cyprus? <hi>how often hath</hi> Paphus <hi>buried it self?</hi> And after this; <hi>Not onely the works of mens hands, and what was built by humane Art and Industry, has time destroyed; but the tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains fall down; whole Countries have sunk down; those places have admitted the raging Seas, which were heretofore removed far enough from the very sight of it: Fire hath devoured those Hills it shone in; and it has heretofore known down the once most exalted Heads, which were a comfort to Sailors, and it has brought down the highest light Houses to a Level with the Sands; the very works of Nature are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally vex'd: and therefore we ought with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to bear the Ruine of Cities, whatever now stands shall fall.</hi> From whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thus: <hi>Let therefore the mind be form'd to a true knowledge and a patient submission to its Lot; and let it know there is nothing which fortune durst not do. She has the same power upon Empires she has upon those that Govern them; the same upon Cities she hath upon distinct
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:66025:204"/>
men. Nothing of this nature is to move our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation: we have entred a World in which these Laws prevail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps I shall seem here too long, and yet I cannot hold my hands from adding in this place the Example of St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who in an Epistle in which he Consolates <hi>Fausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who was then much afflicted for the loss of his Sister, sweetly and elegantly imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Servius, Sulpitius</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> he made use of the same way of Consolation. <hi>But you will say that you grieve</hi> (saith he) <hi>that</hi>

                  <hi>one who so lately was in a most flourishing state, is now so suddenly dead. But this is common not onely to us Men, but to Cities too, and to considerable parts of the World: for when you came from</hi> Bononia <hi>you left behind you</hi> Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerna, Bononia <hi>it self,</hi> Mutina, Rhegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; <hi>and on your right hand was</hi> Brixillum, <hi>before you was</hi> Placentia, <hi>whose very Name preserves the Memory of its Ancient Noble State; upon your left hand you commiserated the</hi> Apennine <hi>Hills, now neglected, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Castles of flourishing people in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, and pass'd by them with much sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And are not the Ruines of so many half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razed Cities, and the Funeral fires which have passed upon so many Countries, of force enough to make you bear with moderation the death of one woman, though she were a Holy and an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable person? whereas the former are cast down for ever; but she is taken away for a time
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:66025:204"/>
onely, and lives more happily where she now is, than we do here.</hi> These very Examples which I have here cited, and many more very like them, will Authours afford us; which if our Historian would diligently observe, and by imitating and applying them as occasion served, endeavour to represent them to men, without all doubt he would reap large and lasting fruits from his labours.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Ecclesiastical History affords more and better fruits; That the good works of the Heathens were nothing but splendid Sins. The <hi>Ethnick</hi> History illustrates onely the second Table of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> but the Church-History the whole Law. In the Prophane History there is nothing but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit shapes of Vertues; but in this the true Vertues are shewn. In the first there are many things that are pleasant and usefull to be known; but in the second there are more things which are necessary: Upon which the Discourse is concluded, with an Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a diligent Reading of the Church-History.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THus far of the Manner of Collecting the Fruits of History in Reading, which if the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ethnick</hi> History afford us in such plenty, and those so pleasant too, what shall we think of those we may gather
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:66025:205"/>
from the <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells the Civil and Prophane History very much in the subject, certainty and perfection of it? We cannot deny but that the Stories of the <hi>Heathens</hi> propound to us very frequent and clear Examples of Justice, Fortitude and Temperance, and of all other Vertues: but if they be thoroughly examin'd and weighed in the balance of Truth, they will be found lame, imperfect and polluted, and not rightly related either to the Mercy or Justice of God: which was the reason why St. <hi>Augustine</hi> call'd those famous Actions of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitat. Dei, l. 19. c. 25.</note> the Heathens <hi>splendid Sins;</hi> and said, that <hi>their Vertues not respecting God, were rather Vices than Vertues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this may be added, that they concern onely the second Table of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and confirm onely the Rules of good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in relation to Civil Conversation: but the <hi>Church-History</hi> illustrates the whole Law with much more certain and more illustrious Examples; and sets out to the best all the parts of Religion, which are very necessary to be well known; and it more clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates whatever the <hi>Ethnick History</hi> knew or wrote truly of God. For what is there in them of any certainty or distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Origine of the World, and the most ancient times? It doth not reach so high as the History of the first Men: It hath no Revelations of God, or Promises concerning the <hi>Messias:</hi> It is plainly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Government of the Church, and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:66025:205"/>
of its Preservation. These things and many other of this nature are onely to be found in the <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick History.</hi> Why do you, O <hi>Marcus Tullius,</hi> extoll History as the <hi>discoverer of Antiquity,</hi> which with you was not very ancient, and yet was sometimes corrupt? You cry her up as the <hi>Witness of times,</hi> but then she was not with you very rich in that, and sometimes was not an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable witness? It is the <hi>Sacred History</hi> onely which discovers the secrets of the most remote Antiquity, and never lies: It is the <hi>Sacred History</hi> alone, which gives a faithfull testimony of the Succession of <hi>times</hi> from the very beginning of all things, and never makes one false step. She alone is the most shining light of the Eternal Truth. And to conclude, she alone is the <hi>best Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of Life,</hi> and absolutely perfect: For tell me where else you can hope to find the unquestionable Precepts of true and solid ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, O ye Readers and Hearers of History! you will certainly be deceived if you seek any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guide than the <hi>Sacred</hi> or <hi>Church-History:</hi> Do you desire to have sincere Examples of true piety? Search then the <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Histories,</hi> and you will find plenty of them, and no where else; there onely are the Monuments of the Knowledge of God, of the Invocation of him, of Faith, and of Repentance preserved; there onely shall you ever meet the wonderfull Instances of perfect fortitude, of pure obedience, of unspotted chastity, of an easie beneficence or ready goodness. <hi>In other Histories, if you
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:66025:206"/>
meet any brave and generous Action</hi> (they are the words of the Interpreter of <hi>Eusebius (it</hi>

                  <hi>was undertaken for the sake of Glory, which is a mere shadow, or of revenging an injury, which ought to be condemn'd; or for the defence of their Countrey, (which sometimes hath more of weight in it:) but the things which are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in this, were not enterprized, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of Popular fame, but for the obtaining true glory, not out of a desire of revenge, but out of the love of Christ; not for the defence of this our Perishable Countrey, but for the obtaining the heavenly Jerusalem.</hi> In short, the words of the Reverend and most Learned Prelate, <note place="margin">Part II. Sect. 42. &amp; 43.</note> which I have cited above, do excellently inform us what and how great things the <hi>Church-History</hi> contains, and proposeth to the serious Contemplation of the Reader of it. Review it (if you please my Hearers) and you shall see that it contains not onely usefull and pleasant things, and which are worth your knowledge and remembrance; but also most grave and necessary Notices, which a Christian, especially a learned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, ought not to be ignorant of. And therefore, to conclude, we do most earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhort our Lover of Histories to Reade over these too, and so much the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly if he be a Student in <hi>Theology,</hi> and have entred into Orders, or does intend to serve the Church, for then it will be his most indispensable duty to turn over the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical History night and day.</p>
