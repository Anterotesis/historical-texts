            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I haue alwaies beene of this opinion, that the reputation of a wiſe man, ties him to more demerit, than an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary man of repute, for the better ſatisfaction herein of generall expectation. And ſo in like manner one that writeth of all actions in generall, hee hath neede of the greater ſufficiency, to obtaine applauſe and liking; becauſe as men are different in their apprehenſions, ſo are they in their humors and approbations, as alſo beſides,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4602:3"/>
it is ſomewhat too curious to preſent them euery day with new inuentions. There is now both a conueniency and neceſſity to preſent to publique the Maske, with which the Lord Admirall of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured their Maieſties, in celebrating the arriuall of the moſt renowned Prince of England in theſe kingdomes, whom their Maieſties, for as many principall cauſes, as moſt important reaſons, doe honour and feſtiuate. A royall feſtiuity no doubt, both to them to whom it was dedicated, and to thoſe who celebrated the ſame, hee being more deepely tied and bound vnto this, than if other Lords ſhould feſtiuate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine their owne Prince, becauſe they are extracted of his bloud (being the Baſis and foundation of all Nobility) in that both the ſame reaſon concurs with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, beſides the greateſt confluence in this, of all the principall States and Princes of Europe, a reaſon that may ſome waies excuſe my rude penne, in that the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hath made good in reall action, the meere fictions of <hi>Turpine,</hi> and <hi>Arioſto;</hi> if it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4602:4"/>
be vnderualued for the breuity, it may be exalted in the acceptance, becauſe as the Prince of Philoſophers affirmed, Hiſtorie is the true touchſtone of men, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe of a benefit is the laſt and black cenſure of ingratefull men. The many benefits wherein (beſides my naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) I ſtand bound to this great Prince, may excuſe me, let all rare ſpirits admit of this ſo good a reaſon, raiſed from ſuch an heroicall foundation.</p>
               <p>On Sunday being Eaſter day, a ſolemne day in all reſpects, which the Admirall made very good choiſe of, becauſe as much time muſt be allowed for ſacred, as for prophane exerciſes: The Queenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, clothed in white, a colour of exhila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and gladneſſe, which the Church obſerueth for the Annuali remembrance of the reſurrection of her deare Spouſe, ſet out with rare iewels, and precious ſtones, (whereof ſhe hath ſtore, and the preſent occaſion, gaue her cauſe to make ſhew of them) dined in publike. The Gallants of the Court tooke their place with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4602:4"/>
and the dinner drew out ſomewhat late, becauſe their Maieſties went before to the Chappell to ſolemnize the Feaſt. For neither their feſtiuities, nor their yeeres apt to take delight in them, can draw them to omit their religious zeale; it being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall reſpect of this Monarchy, as it alſo hath beene of all other ages; for the zeale of <hi>Numa</hi> wrought greater effects in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Monarchy, than the valour of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince in like manner dined in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, attended with the aſſiſtance and care of the <hi>Conde de Puebla,</hi> as Maſter of the feaſt, a valiant vnderſtanding Gentleman, and <hi>Mayor domo,</hi> or Lord Steward of the Court.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen taſters attended, and the Earle of <hi>Briſtow</hi> miniſtred vnto him the towell.</p>
               <p>The King came out to euening prayer, and then there went for his Highneſſe, the reſplendent and noble troupe of all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable of theſe kingdomes, and other ſtrange Nobility, which are now heere in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4602:5"/>
great number: then followed the <hi>Mayor domos,</hi> with their Officiall ſtaues, and all the <hi>Grandes,</hi> the traine finiſhing in the Duke of <hi>Infantado:</hi> whoſe hoarie haires, when the Sunne of his youth had paſſed the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith of his more flouriſhing age, entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſiluer Spheare of <hi>Cynthia,</hi> to illuſtrate the world with his countenance. The King was placed, and the Prince on his right hand, his Maieſty clothed in Aſhe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: with a great golden fleece, and a chaine baudrick wiſe, which might haue bard in the <hi>Coloſsian</hi> Port of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> (I tooke this chaine to bee of many Crownes linked, by foure in a knot, cemented toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with greene and blacke Emerald) and if the French ſay true in this, that euery action of a King is Royall, theſe foure Crownes linked together, and hanging at his Maieſties breaſt, ſhall be ſo many king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. In his hat, his girdle, and for other Iewels of Diamonds, he diminiſhed the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Phoebus beames; wearing in his hat a large wauing and aiery Plume. The Prince was in blacke, richly garded after the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4602:5"/>
faſhion, with the George about his necke, hanging by a watchet riban. The enameld garter, exceeded that colour in brightneſſe, and his Maieſty might as cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſcernd, as a Sunne a midſt the Stars, this not being the meaneſt action and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance of his prudence, that being a trauelling gueſt who came by Poſt, not being able at the inſtant, to ſhine with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall luſtre, he came to participate of the Spaniſh Sunne.</p>
               <p>Immediatly after came the Engliſh Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, and <hi>Oliuares,</hi> both Maſters of the horſe, The Counſell of Eſtate, the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of Princes, and the Chamber of the Citie, great in number, but greater in bloud and diſcent.</p>
               <p>Being come to the Queenes quarter, which was all hung with Tapiſtrie of Tunys, and Petrarckes triumphs, ſet forth in embroyderie, well knowne both for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and varietie of inuention: The Prince vrged by all meanes, that his Maieſtie would be pleaſed firſt to enter, but at laſt he yeelded to the Kings pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Queene accompanied with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:4602:6"/>
who was then in her Quarter, to wiſh her an happy Eaſter, went out to receiue them, apparrelled in blacke, and gold, of wonderfull rich and ſtately, whether with naturall, or ſupernaturall beauty, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt paſſion, is a vertue ſupernaturall. After many complements paſt, they went to ſit downe vnder a cloth of Eſtate, which was of cloth of Gold, three ſeuerall degrees in height, of Mylan Carnation, and chaires of the ſame. The Prince tooke place on the right hand of the Queene, and the King on the right hand of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> they two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the midſt. The Engliſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in ordinary, diſchargd the office of Interpreter, by whoſe relation he ſaluted the Queene with a good Eaſter; he was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the like ceremony: and hauing performed theſe courteſies and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before the Queene, hee came to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> who entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with that modeſty and grauity, as might haue befitted greater yeares and more experience of time. Their Maieſties mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted their alacrity, by ſmiling twice, or thrice, and there aroſe ſuch beautifull

bluſhes in the Sunne of the Lady <hi>Infantaes</hi> countenance, which beheld without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection, could cauſe no leſſe than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and wonder. They returnd to ſit downe, and while the ladies, who were courting it among the gallants, ſpent the time in expreſſing their ſeuerall conceits; their Maieſties departed, and returned in the ſame manner and forme as they came, and then ſhewed themſelues at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of the ſouth Gallery <hi>Cierzo,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the Highneſſes, of the Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Infants,</hi> to view the tryall of armes, wherein the youth of this great Court, ſhewed both dexterity, and valour. In the meane while <hi>Apollo</hi> fearing two Sunnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired his light, and gaue way to a Maske, which was in this manner: There were diuers races for Careers made, rayld in with bord, and timber worke breſt high, within the Courtes of the Pallace, that of <hi>Deſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zas,</hi> and the great Court. The trembling and watriſh beames of <hi>Diana,</hi> would fame haue ſupplied the defect of <hi>Apolloes</hi> Rayes, and one might perceiue that no borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed light (though in the abſence, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4602:7"/>
of the principall) can be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to light naturall, though indeed thoſe artificiall did much eclipſe it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all the whole place, and the corners did ſhine, the progenie and effect, of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall care of <hi>Iuan de Caſtilia Corrigidor,</hi> executed in the ſeruice and honour of his Princes, except it proceeded from the beames of that Spaniſh beauty, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to behold the Feſtiuitie, who did imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate herein the celeſtial Spheares, the Queene and the <hi>Infanta</hi> ſtood in the great gallery, and the Prince, and the Infant Cardinall, on the left hand, accompanied with the Engliſh and Spaniſh Nobility, that had no part in the Maske, and were appointed their places. There attended on the Queene, and the <hi>Infanta,</hi> beſides the chiefe Ladies of the Chamber, the Counteſſe of <hi>Oliuares,</hi> who can giue a life to all actions of greatneſſe, and courtſhip, as one who (beſides her own noble diſpoſition and nature) hath for her Inſtructor the Count, and the Honourable Ladie of the houſe of <hi>Mendoza</hi> my good Lady, and the Lady of <hi>Infantado,</hi> whoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable gray haires gaue great reſpect, if the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4602:7"/>
hereditary ſplendor of her glorious proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors had failed, with many other Ladies of theſe Kingdomes.

The moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Nuncio,</hi> to whom the firſt ſtanding was allotted, and next to the Royall ſeate, betweene his Maieſtie and the Queene, had for his Aſſociates, the moſt excellent Embaſſadors, of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, of France, Poland, and Venice, ſtarrs of great and rare Magnitude, the reſt were diſperſed all over the breadth of the place,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4602:16"/>
the Queene was placed next vnto them, and of the right ſide in Royall partitions, the Ladyes, Dames, and noble Pages of the Court: While you come to the Counſell of Royall Excellencie; for the Corrigidor and his Lieutenants being entred, with their vſuall Trayne of Officers; he went out to enterteine them, that high Senate entring with ſuch a wonderfull Maieſtie, that it may onely be an example, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident to it ſelfe. The <hi>Corrigidor</hi> gaue a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Liverie to eight Pages, and foure La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queyes, of plaine blacke Velvet, furniture, and skirts embroydered with Snayles, and Gandurados, Cloakes of cloth, with baſes of feet, and Doublets of blacke Satten, garded with blacke Lace, and Feathers of a colour, which all the place admired, and wondered at.</p>
               <p>The other Counſells and Lordes being placed in their ſeverall roomes, the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of the Queene, and of the Infanta made entrie in their Carroches, clothed in a dark kind of gray, wrought with embroydery, and Lentills of Gold, with Iewells, and Plumes, (a thing very needleſſe to relate)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4602:17"/>
ſeeing all Rhetoricall colors of the tongue, cannot expreſſe the truth of their incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable value, and eſtimation. Their Highneſſes, Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> one in Purple, and the other in Blacke, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in Beautie, and yet prevented one another in affection. The Coches of the Ladies, and Minnies of the Court, the very Envie of <hi>Phoebus</hi> rayes, were Retraytes of the Moneth, which then raygned for Beautie, and varietie of collours, ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the greateſt concourſe of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, that ever the Empire of glory, and gallantrie beheld. And then firſt lighting on foot, the Marqueſſe of <hi>Reutine</hi> of <hi>Almaine</hi> made entrie for their Maieſties, betweene the Gardes, conducted by their Captaine; excellently ſet forth himſelfe, wearing a Plume, Preparations, and a braue Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of a darke yellow, and yellow furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Don <hi>Ferdinando Verdugo,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> in white, and blacke, in a Liverie of darke greene, white fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, both conteſting one with another, for greateſt riches and pompe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:4602:17"/>
The whole Troope being conducted by the <hi>Alcaldes</hi> on Horſebacke, and by a great number of Engliſh, and Spaniſh Knights, Officers, and Grandes. The Prince of Wales was relucent, in white and blacke Plumes, mounted on a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle-colloured Horſe, and the King appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in a darke colour'd Sute, with a Plume of the ſame, mounted on a dap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Gray; in their legeritie, implying the effects of the Stormie <hi>Boreas,</hi> and in their faire and quiet managing, ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues almoſt reaſonable, as if they had knowne the burdens, that they bare: And in that their mouthes were curbed with no Bitts, in this they ſignified, that in an high Degree, they layd downe, all their naturall, and brutiſh fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Behinde came the Admirall of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the <hi>Conde de Oliuares,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Horſe, Embaſſadours, and Engliſh Gentrie, with the Counſells of Eſtate, and Chamber of Spaine, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing Within the Guard of Archers, the Burgundian Nobilitie, having procured
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4602:18"/>
admiration and loue, not with feare, or tyrannie, but with ſweet, and affable go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which in mens hearts purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth loue, and good will. They light on foot, and having forſaken their Stooles and Chayres, the Queene our Ladie, and the Ladie Infanta remain'd in the Scaffold on the right hand, the Infant <hi>Charles,</hi> and the Prince being divided by one partition, and the King, and the Infant <hi>Ferdinando</hi> by the other, and in that which remayned enſuing, the <hi>Conde de Oliuares,</hi> the Engliſh Embaſſadors, the Counſells of Eſtate, the Chamber of Spaine and England, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knights and Gentlemen of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on Scaffolds erected vp into the ayre, in a corner of the ſtreet of the <hi>Amargura,</hi> and they made entrie for theſe Lords.</p>
               <p>Fiftie Laqueyes in high Dutch habite, of thynne cloth of Silver, white, and tawney, with tawney-doubletts, caps of wrought Silver, and Swords Silvered in every part, accompanied the Duke of <hi>Cea,</hi> who entred in, mounted on a large dapple Gray, with blacke habite, edged round about with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Goldſmiths-worke, with as great
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4602:18"/>
gallantry as wiſedome, and as much wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as reaſon to winne mens hearts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, two valiant Combatants at the Bull, with Caſſockes and Hoſe of tawney cloth, layd along with Silver lace, and great tawney Plumes, mingled Turquye and White. He had ſcarcely gone his round about the place, preſented himſelfe to their Maieſties, and beene received of the Prince, with the honor of diſcovering himſelfe to him, when there entred into the place (being clearly voyded, ſo as their entries were more eaſie and apparent) an hundred Lacqueyes clothed in darke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Serge, garded all over with Lace, with Belts ſhining like Silver, Doubletts and Hoſe, Lynings and Caps of Tawney colour, like furniture to their Swords, and white Garters: And after them came in Don <hi>Iuan de Ozeta,</hi> Don <hi>Ieronimo de Medinilla,</hi> Don <hi>Euan de Meneſſes,</hi> Don <hi>Antonio Guino,</hi> Don <hi>Iaſepe de Samano,</hi> Don <hi>Iuan Ieldre,</hi> the <hi>Conde de Cantillana,</hi> Don <hi>Diego de Zarate,</hi> Don <hi>Antonio de Moſcoſo,</hi> Don <hi>Pedro de Motezuma,</hi> the <hi>Conde de Tendilla,</hi> accompanyed with the Duke of <hi>Maqueda,</hi> whoſe entrie, both in reſpect of

his qualitie, as alſo for the Valour and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of his perſon, might well haue ſtirr'd vp envie in the Romaine Triumphes, for the Duke lookt like one of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> or rather in deed, he might more properly haue beene their patterne, and example. They went along their Round, and the Prince himſelfe did him honour, when by different gates, theſe herevnder ſpecified, made their entire: The Marqueſſe of <hi>Vela,</hi> in whom valour, dexteritie, and gallantrie contended for ſuperioritie, accompanyed with foure and twentie Lacqueyes, in white cloth, all laced downe, with blacke Caps, Plumes, and other furniture for their Swords of white. He drew vpon himſelfe the eyes of the whole multitude, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he drew generally vnto him all their affections; the Prince did him honour, as he likewiſe did the other two Lords Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: When he had ſeene their Maieſties, he went to offer himſelfe vnto the Ladies, from thence to the Counſell Royall, and ſo in his going about, to all the reſt of the Company, and all of them deſired, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:4602:19"/>
Preſently entred fiftie Lacqueyes in white Printed Sattin, guarded with a brancht Stuffe of Azur'd Silke, and Gold, and Breeches of the ſame, ſet out with tuffes of gold, and ſilver lace, with furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Plumes of white, that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the <hi>Conde de Villamor,</hi> mounted on a darke Cheſtnut-colourd Horſe, with his mayne, and tayle, drawne out with ſilver twiſt, diſgracing thoſe Horſes of <hi>Phoebus</hi> Chariot, which ſeem'd to come out of them, as the ſome or ſweat of their bodies, eiecting that which was not naturall in them, retayning naturally the valour of their Maſter, communicated to them, and when I ſaw ſo many Feathers in the place, and ſuch a flittering and waving of them, I tooke them to be a moovible garden, or an Armie of Indians; as alſo the <hi>Conde</hi> his generous Grandfather, who alſo manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt them, the valour, and luſtre, incident to his race and blood: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the report is feſtivall, it is but like to that which was to be ſeene with the eye. You would haue ſaid as much, if you had but ſeene them fight with thoſe furious
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4602:20"/>
Beaſts, ſhewing themſelues the more vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, in that they were vndaunted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Spanyards. There entred preſently Don <hi>Criſtoual de Gauiria,</hi> and Don <hi>Gaſper Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifaz,</hi> whom they tearme kill Bulls, I know not which of them may envie the other, ſeeing they are the beſt Combatants knowne in all Spaine for this place, and fight; and both of them ſo well beloued, that their attempts being high and great, yet they are alwayes wiſhed to be greater, and we thinke them worthy of greater, and higher Fortunes. <hi>Bonifaz</hi> clad ſix Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queyes in excellent cloth in grane, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that of Tyre, garded, with other furniture, and white Feathers, what they were, might be ſeene all the place over: and <hi>Gauiria</hi> had eyght, and two little Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queyes in darke greene Sutes, cutt, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydered with Snailes of ſilver, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Tawney, and white furniture o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, it being a ſightly and braue Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p>There entred Don <hi>Ferrando de Yuiciedo,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, the Cavallier <hi>de la Morzilla,</hi> who during theſe Tryalls, was that ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4602:20"/>
Burquillos of the Combates, of <hi>Lope de Vega,</hi> who came in to try his Fortunes, with Lawnce and Target.</p>
               <p>Though the Marſhalling of the place belong'd to the <hi>Conde de Oliuares,</hi> as to the grand Maſter of the Horſe; His Maieſtie yeelding precedencie to the Prince, the Admirall of England Marſhal'd it, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding behind the Lord Infant <hi>Carlos,</hi> that he might be neare to the <hi>Conde de Oliuares,</hi> who was to him both an Interpretor, and Informer, for this great Lord, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Courtier, hath omitted no rightes of complement, wherein he might expreſſe, either vnto the Prince, or Admirall, the loue, proceeding from his owne Noble diſpoſition and nature, and conformable to the honour, done him by the King of great Brittaine, in his Letters full of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and gravitie.</p>
               <p>The Combat beganne with the Bulls, when the Lacqueyes by Proclamation leauing their Lords, they reſembled Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt in Iune, crowned with blew and redd flowers, which <hi>Zephirus</hi> waues, and flitters vp and downe. The firſt encounter
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4602:21"/>
belong'd to the <hi>Conde de Villamor,</hi> as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie of all the reſt, which they revenged with ſuch a number of Darts, as the poore Bulles remayn'd like Quivers, or like the Thorne-buſhes, in the woods of <hi>Helvetia.</hi> To ſpeake more properly, ſeeing to the poore Beaſts wonderfull paine, they tooke them out with as great velocitie, as perill and danger. <hi>De Maqueda</hi> made many braue a tempts: <hi>de Tendilla,</hi> as many, but <hi>de Cea</hi> made excellent aſſaults, and <hi>Cantil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lana</hi> too, one of which might be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per envie, of chivalrous attempts, and in the other he killed a Bull. <hi>Bonifaz,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiria</hi> layd on ſo thicke vpon the Bull, that we could not number the aſſaults for their quantitie, and Don <hi>Chriſtovall</hi> with a Lawnce, overthrew one. <hi>De Velada</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how agile, and nymble he was in this Art, for he overthrew two or three Bulls, with dynt of Sword, and gore of Lawnce, and one he wounded on his foretopp, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the hornes, while he turned his head, he ſtroke his horne into a ſupporting bord at his backe, a wound that ſtrooke more feare into the Aſſembly, then it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4602:21"/>
brought danger to the Marqueſſe, for this backe bord, was ſplinted all to ſhivers in the place: And his Maieſtie would not ſuffer him to enter the ſecond time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Liſts: And Don <hi>Antonio de Moſcoſo,</hi> gaue ſuch a number, and ſo deepe Cuchil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladaes, that he might be rather ſayd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, then provoke or incite with his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, <hi>Cea</hi> turnd one round with a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chillada, and ſo moſt of the Beaſts were ſlaine, being hewen into mammockes by the hands of all men. <hi>Motezuna</hi> ſhewed, what belongd to his royall blood, and to the valour of his arme, for he put a Bull to flight, being afrayd of him, and reacht him ſuch a cleauing blow with his ſword, that he left him in the place for dead. <hi>Guino, Zarate, Ozeta,</hi> and <hi>Idchel,</hi> tooke revenge of the laſt Bulls liuing, becauſe the firſt had made them turne face. Don <hi>Gieronimo de Medinilla</hi> had good Fortune, both with his Lawnce, and Sword. This Cavallier being herein ſo meritorious, as the moſt copious Elegies would come ſhort of his due commendation, and praiſe. The Duke of <hi>Maqueda,</hi> made ſuch a thruſt, that the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4602:22"/>
Beaſt being batterd, and ſore goared with it, he reveng'd himſelfe in ſuch a ſtrange faſhion vpon his Horſe, that he ranne him quite through, from one ſide to the other, and the Duke beheld the Aſſault given on the one ſide of his Horſe, and the horne of the Bull, as it came out at the other, and the poore brute Beaſt gaue ſo many twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and wrenches, enforced with paine, and griefe, that the Duke was fayne to vſe all valour, and dexteritie to prevent his owne falling, whereat we were all much afraid. Don <hi>Antonio Guino,</hi> ſecond to the Duke of <hi>Cea,</hi> made one of the braveſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, that ever the place beheld, vpon a moſt violent and furicus Bull, whoſe liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly force, and that of his valiant arme, ranne him in quite through the ſhoulders, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing halfe his Lawnce within him, and his Horſe remaining with as much ſtilnes and lenitie, as his Maſter with valour and magnanimitie: and ſo the Bull fell downe hard by him. He received wonderfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, and generall grace, and ſo went out of the place, and though the Bulls over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw many, yet there fell out no great
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4602:22"/>
danger at all. When this Feſtivitie was ended, the Prince, the King, and their Highneſſes, returned to the Court in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roches; and it rayn'd very ſtrangely. After that went the Queene, the Infanta, and the Coaches of Ladies, where amongſt the Clouds of water, there fell one of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Armes, theſe Clouds by day light innudating the dominion and acceſſe of the ſhaddows of the night, and baniſhing them for a great while. Thus a great part of the night being ſpent, they went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues, after the repaſt and pleaſure of this Feſtivitie, and ſo my Penne ſhall doe no leſſe, till further and fitter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion be offered. &amp;c.</p>
