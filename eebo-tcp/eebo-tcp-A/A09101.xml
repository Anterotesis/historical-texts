         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That there were other straungers present, is noe lesse vanitie: for that they were but ordinarie seruantes of the house, one, the manciple, and thother the master of the chappel in the colledge, which bothe are citizens of Rome, and yet not strangers.</p>

that the Pope would haue sturred him agaynst Christians, by denyinge so iuste a demaund, which in conscience he could not doe, sÃ©einge he hath not onely doonne more, of him selfe, then that commeth too, but also procured other Princes to doe the lyke, and that without anye letters of soe greate a Potentate as the Turke is, namely, at my being in Rome, I saw a great man of Swetia deliuered from the Inquisition,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The</hi> thirde accusation, wherwith Iohn Nicols presseth his benifactor the Pope, is, <hi>For taking from a moncke two pretious stones, worth a hundreth thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande crownes, whiche he had broughte from India, and presented to this Pope, which he acepting of, in stead of rewarde, put the monke in prison for departinge his Abby without licence.</hi> And this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a great point of iniquitie, which is maruelous, the partie wronged being a monke, from whome to take not onlye moueable goodes, but also his Abbye and lyfe too, had bene noe offence in a protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Prince, by the cannons of new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie. Marye in the Pope all thinges must be haynous. But yet before indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent iudges, I might aske this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb facs="tcp:21043:22"/>
If the matter had bene true, and if the Pope had taken these iewels from the monke, as from his subiect not cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or fitt for soe great riches, and had also punished him for leauing his cloister without order: what lawe or reason ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this matter so haynous as is obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? but I am perswaded, that all this whole tale is ether false or mistaken. For diuers which were in Rome since and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore Iohn Nicols, doe reporte no suche thing to haue happened in their time, but onlye that a Spanishe marchant, which dwelleth at the foote of Trinitie hill, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes <hi>Porta del populo,</hi>

Secondly, for that, if they were bothe great and haynous, and also true: yet were they noe preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to religion, whose slaunder hÃ©ere is sought, for the reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s aleaged by S.

For thanked be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouidence of our mercyfull Sauiour, he hath blessedly prouided for the malice of our time, by placing in that rowme, soe vertuous and iust a man, as maye stopp the barking chappes of all his spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and slaunderous enemies, especially in this crime of couetous iniquitie, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected against him by the shamles ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of him only, who confesseth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of more lberalitie from him in few monethes,<note place="margin">

I saye Pope Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie is greatly wronged, to be charged with that vice, wherof neuer Prince in mans reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>brance, hath had so many testi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monies of the contrarie vertue.

Fiftly, it is false, that horrible abuses are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in Rome at shrouetide, for in this Popes time, ther are permitted no other pastimes, to be spoken of, at shrouetide, but only running with horse, an olde excersise of the getlemen Romans.
