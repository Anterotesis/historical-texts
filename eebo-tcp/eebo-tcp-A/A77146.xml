         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SALUTATION of LOVE FROM A Priſoner for the Teſtimony of Chriſt Jeſus To his Loving and Kind Neighbours.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>FRIENDS and Neighbours, in and about <hi>Bromſgrove,</hi> amongſt whom I have had my abode from my Childhood,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I underſtanding many of you are concerned for me, and diſſatisfied concerning my preſent Sufferings, which with a Spirit of Meekneſs and Moderation I ſhall endeavour to ſatisfie, if it may be.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Friends,</hi> we have all one Maſter, that we muſt either ſtand or fall to; for we muſt all give an Account to God of our Deeds done in the Body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Good, or whether they be Evil, which I deſire to ſtand Approved before. And although ſome may account my Sufferings Frivolous, or out of a Stubborn Will, I do deſire to appeal unto the Lord, who knoweth the Integrity of my Heart, and that knoweth all things, that it is not in a Stubborn Will, nor in Contempt of Authority, but in Obedience unto to the Lord, to bear a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt thoſe who profeſs themſelves Miniſters of the Goſpel, and walk contrary to the Command of Chriſt, and Examples of the true Miniſters in the Primitive Time. Now it may be ſaid, <hi>That every Soul ought to be ſubject unto the higher Powers;</hi> which my Soul deſires to be, and to ſubmit to Magiſtrates in their places, ſo that I may keep my Conſcience clear unto the Lord; and to pay Tribute to the King, who is ſet over us, as a Ruler to defend our Juſt Rights in outward things; but our <hi>Conſcience</hi> we muſt keep clear unto the Lord, for he muſt Rule there: for God muſt have his Due as well as <hi>Caeſar</hi> his. We do not read in the Scriptures, that it belonged to <hi>Caeſar</hi> to chuſe Prophets or Prieſts in the Time of the Law; that was God's Due and Work, and belonged unto him, who made uſe of <hi>Aaron</hi> to be as a Mouth and Prieſt unto <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and choſe the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> to perform the Prieſthood under the Law, &amp; gave them the Tenth of the Encreaſe, who were to have no other Inheritance amongſt their Brethren; but the Tenth was their Portion in the old Covenant, who ſtood until the time of Reformation, and remained for the offering up of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, until Chriſt, the acceptable Sacrifice, was offered up, <hi>Who offered himſelf up once for all, and put an end to that Prieſthood under the Law, which continued not by Reaſon of Death; and ſo ſtands as Prieſt forever, who ever liveth to make Interceſſion for us,</hi> Heb. 7.23, 24, 25. And ſo this Prieſthood which was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Tythe, <hi>is Changed, and that Law alſo,</hi> verſ 12. for Chriſt is to be Prophet, Prieſt and Law-giver: And it is he only and alone that chuſeth Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and fitteth them for his Uſe and Service, and ſends them forth and takes Care of them, who ſent them forth as Lambs amongſt Wolves, and were not to take thought what to eat or what to put on, but to enquire, <hi>Who was worthy,</hi> and to eat ſuch things as were ſet before them: They were not to Compel a Tenth of Peoples Labours, for they had no ſuch Command; for that Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that took Tythe was to ceaſe: Chriſt's Miniſters received Freely of him, and were to adminiſter Freely. And ſo it was not <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Due nor Place to chuſe Miniſters and appoint Maintenance for them, but God's and Chriſt's Due: And ſo we muſt give <hi>Caeſar</hi> his Due in outward Things, and <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> their Due in ſpiritual Things, and in chuſing Miniſters for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and appointing them a Maintenance. The Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>He was not made a Miniſter by the Will of Man, nor received his Goſpel from Man, neither was taught it of Man, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1.1, 11, 12. And the holy Ghoſt ſaid, <hi>Separate</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>for the Work I have for them to do;</hi> and they were ſent by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2, 3, 4. And theſe whom the Lord choſe were not ſent to Schools to learn <hi>Latine, Greek</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> to make them Goſpel-Miniſters, which are but Natural Languages, and then to a Colledge to take their Degrees, as <hi>Batchelors of Art</hi> and <hi>Maſters of Art,</hi> for Chriſt commanded his Miniſters not to be called <hi>Maſters,</hi> Mat. 23.10. and <hi>Batchelors of Divinity</hi> and <hi>Doctors of Divinity;</hi> and if they can make Friends with Money, or otherwiſe, they may be made <hi>Lord Biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Deans,</hi> and have Hundreds or Thouſands by the Year; which all is come in ſince the Apoſtles Dayes, and ſince <hi>Popery</hi> came up, in the dark Night of Apoſtacy: For we do not read in the Scriptures of Truth of a <hi>Lord Biſhop;</hi> they were not to be <hi>Lords over God's Heritage,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.1, 2, 3. There you may read they were not to compel a Tenth of Peoples Labours; but to feed the Flock of God, taking the over-ſight thereof, not by Conſtraint, but Willingly; not for filthy Lucre, but with a ready Mind: And when the chief Shephard ſhall appear, they ſhall have a Crown of Life that fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth not away. But theſe who are made Miniſters by Man, taking their Degrees from Schools and Colledges, they Exerciſe Lordſhip over People; he that for Conſcience-ſake cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their Corrupt Greedy-Mind, they ſoon make uſe of a Law againſt them; and it may be, for the value of Five or Six Shillings will caſt a man into Priſon, and there keep him, it may be, Moneths, Years, or for Term of Life: We do not read of ſuch Proceedings amongſt the True <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And they will tell us, <hi>It is the Law that takes hold of us,</hi> like the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were ſtirred up by the chief Prieſts, againſt Chriſt, our Lord and Maſter, to put him to Death; <hi>Pilate</hi> finding him a Juſt Man, and nothing worthy of Death, they ſaid, <hi>We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to Dye,</hi> John 16.6, 7. Now ſome may ſay, <hi>Do you compare your ſelves to Chriſt?</hi> I ſay, no otherwiſe but as Chriſt Our Lord and Maſter, and We his Servants and Followers, who ſaid, <hi>The Servant is not greater than his Lord; they have perſecuted me, and they will perſecute you.</hi> And ſo that is our Portion from theſe that exerciſe Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip over People, that bind heavy Burdens, and lay them on mens Shoulders, grievous to be born, and they themſelves not touch them with one of their Fingers.</p>
            <p>And ſo, <hi>Friends</hi> &amp; <hi>Neighbours,</hi> having ſomething cleared my Spirit, I leave it with you, to conſider well of it; and the Deſire of my Soul, and Prayer of my Heart unto the Lord for you, is, <hi>That an underſtanding may be opened in you.</hi> And <hi>loving Neighbours,</hi> I deſire you in the Bowels of Love &amp; Tenderneſs, <hi>That you judge not of things before the Time;</hi> for the Day will diſcover all things, and bring every hidden things before to light; and then it will be known who are they that ſerve the Lord, and they that ſerve him not; and a Separation will be betwixt the Precious and the Vile. And in the mean time I do deſire to reſt ſatisfied in my Condition, until the Lord pleaſe to ſet me Free, which I believe will be in his appointed time: <hi>He who knows our Grief, and Bottleth up our Tears, will Eaſe the Oppreſſed, and ſet the Priſoners Free.</hi> And Loving and kind Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, I call you Loving and Kind, becauſe you have been ſo to me, I take my leave of you, and reſt your Friend and Neighbour, willing, in what I may, to ſerve you in Love,</p>
