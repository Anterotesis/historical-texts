            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Honoured SIR,</salute>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a sorrowfull losse occasioned the delivery of this Sermon in your eares, and the seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable comfort you then found, caused those desires which (being to me commands) occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the presenting of it to your eyes.</p>
            <p>The tryall wherewith God hath been pleased to exercise you, cannot but be grievous, yet a patient sufferance and sanctified use will make it precious: no better means of support under, and benefit by this tryall then faith, which is both a powerfull Antidote against the crosse, and a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Alchymist to extract spirituall advantage out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall losses.</p>
            <p>It is true you have lost a hopefull son, but faith will eye God, as a wise and gracious Father. Charity comforts you in the hope that he hath gained, the enjoyment of glory by his dissolution: Faith will instruct you in the Christian art, how to gain increase of grace by this affliction. It is the justice of God that hee never punisheth without a cause, it is his mercy that he ordereth all to a good end, let

repentance find out and bewail sin deserving, and faith will apprehend the benefit intended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh divine grace of faith, many daughters have done worthily, but thou surmountest them all; thou regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latest our actions, and moderatest our passions, thou teachest us how to enjoy, and supplyest us in what wee want; by thee wee finde the sweetnesse of a God in the creature-comforts we have, and the sweetnesse of those comforts we lose in a God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now worthy Sir, what bitter counsell could I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe you then this of Faith? what fuller example of faiths energie could I set before you then that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> who by faith gave up that <hi>Isaac</hi> to God, whom God had conferr'd on him in love. The picture of this believing Patriark, offering up his obedient <hi>Isaac,</hi> you have delineated in the following Sermon.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Abrahams</hi> steps be your walk, and his bosome shall be your rest; imitate him as a son in the grace of Faith, and you shall be an heire together with him in the grace of life, whech is the prayer of him who is</p>

            <head>On the death of Master <hi>John Rushout,</hi> eldest Sonne of Master <hi>John Rushout,</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Merchant.</head>
            <l>WHo slew all these? was <hi>Nimshi's</hi> sonne's demand,</l>
            <l>When's will was done by false <hi>Samaria's</hi> hand,</l>
            <l>When heads were heapt, and Nobles (by the rude)</l>
            <l>Were made the many-headed multitude:</l>
            <l>When slain <hi>Youth,</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> were heap'd on high,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> pil'd with <hi>Nobility.</hi>

            <l>Who slew all these? each tear now seems to say,</l>
            <l>The mourner drops by this sad heap of clay.</l>
            <l>Nor doe they soloecise, for in <hi>Rushout's</hi> sonne</l>
            <l>There's a heap'd funerall, though he be but one.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Logick</hi> is out, it's praecepts erre in this,</l>
            <l>He is but one, and yet a number is.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Arithmetick</hi> mistakes in him, for we</l>
            <l>If not divide, yet one may multiply.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Beauty, Strength</hi> and <hi>Youth</hi> are here</l>
            <l>Heap'd up and pil'd together: on this Biere</l>

            <l>Not one of these, but might compleat a man.</l>
            <l>The tears that from his Fathers eyes doe run,</l>
            <l>Fall for but one Sonne, and yet not for One.</l>
            <l>When he laments his <hi>Beauty</hi> so soon gone,</l>
            <l>Doth he not Weep for his Dead <hi>Absolom?</hi>
            </l>

            </l>
            <l>'Tis for his <hi>Isaac</hi> sure those tears distill.</l>
            <l>When he recounts the <hi>Wisdome</hi> of his Sonne,</l>
            <l>And Sighs, sighs he not for his <hi>Solomon?</hi>

            <l>Who slew all these then? not the barbarous hand,</l>

of choyce duties; yea, the worker of strange Miracles. The truth of all which our Apostle illustrates by various examples, since though positive doctrines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what faith can doe, yet plain examples shew what faith hath done: amongst many others wee have the president of <hi>Abraham,</hi> chiefe of the Patriarks, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the saithfull set before us: if you cast your eyes upon the 8 <hi>verse,</hi> you shall there finde an eminent instance of his faith, <hi>When he was called to goe out into a place which he should after receive for inheritance, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he went out not knowing whither he went</hi>; no easie matter, doubtlesse, for a man to part with his friends and live among strangers, to let goe his present possessions for uncertain enjoyments, and become a voluntary exile from his own Countrey; sence derides it, reason contemns it, but faith obeys it: nor doth his faith stay here, behold in the Text a harder task impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon, and performed by him; that was to leave his Countrey, this was to lose his <hi>Isaac:</hi> that was to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ in a strange Land, this to commit a strange act: that to forsake his fathers house, this to forgoe his sons life: in that he sayled against the winde, in this against the winde and tyde: but the strength of faith carryed him through, enabling him to leave his countrey when called; and to offer his <hi>Isaac</hi> when tryed.</p>
            <q>By faith Abraham, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>In the words we have these three observables;

            <p n="2">2 Chiefly the end of tryall is a discovery of our graces, both their truth, and strength, their quality and measure. Tryalls shew what is the depth of our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the breadth of our patience, the height of our love, and the length of our perseverance, observe but this tryall of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and you shall find what a many graces here was tryed and discovered: namely,</p>
            <p>His faith, whether he would depend upon Gods, Promise above, against reason.</p>
            <p>His obedience, whether he would yeild to Gods command against nature.</p>

To this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines answer, that <hi>Isaac</hi> being religiously educated, and no doubt, by his father, sufficiently informed of Gods will in this particular, submitted himselfe to be offered up.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99009:14"/>
yet God commands that <hi>Isaac</hi> should be slain. Might not <hi>Abraham</hi> well have reasoned thus. <hi>What, Lord, are thy decrees changable, or thy promise failable? how can these two stand together,</hi> Isaac <hi>shall be a father of many nations, and yet he must dye by his fathers hands? what fruit is to be expected from a dry root, or what hopes can there be in a dead</hi> Isaac? the truth is to sense and reason, there is a manifest contrariety between his precept and his promise, neyther of these eyes can see how God should fulfill what hee had promised if <hi>Abraham</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd what he required, but faith hath a piercing sight, so, she steps in, untyes the knot, and thus bespeaks <hi>Abraham: Feare not</hi> Abraham <hi>to sacrifice thy son, hee that commands thee to kill him, wants not power to quicken him; the same hand which raised him from the dead wombe of</hi> Sarah, <hi>can revive him from the ashes of a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, thou gottest thy</hi> Isaac <hi>by believing, thou shalt not lose him by obeying.</hi> Now faith hath got the day, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined the victory. What cruelty doth in others, that faith did in <hi>Abraham,</hi> makes him not to be moved at the strangenesse of the fact, God knew he had to do with an <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore puts upon him such a comand; <hi>Abraham</hi> knew he had to do with a God, and therefore believes what he commands is good: and what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth is infallible.

            <p>Briefly, faith wrought in <hi>Abraham</hi> a double effect which inclined him to offer up <hi>Isaac.</hi>

            <p>In regard of the promise it assured him God was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to raise up <hi>Isaac</hi> from the dead, as it is <hi>Verse</hi> 19th, that notwithstanding all seeming contrarieties, and though hee saw no way of accomplishment, divine power could act above, against means, and so he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth above and beyond hope.</p>
            <p>In reference to his command, it perswadeth him this was Gods will to which he must subscribe, that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty was his sovereigne Lord to dispose of him and his how hee pleased, and therefore ought to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>Thus being confident of Gods ability and fidelity in making good his word, being resolved to exalt Gods will above his own, hee readily performeth his duty, <hi>and by faith when he was tryed, offered up</hi> Isaac.</p>
            <p>To shut it up in a brief application, learne wee all to prize the worth, and endeavour for the growth of this grace of faith, we know not what tryals God may call us, but, alasse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how shall we bear them if not supported by faith, its faith is the only weapon to resist Satans temptations, and the best staffe to hold us up under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine tryals: this grace of faith, as it is of singular worth, so of universall use, in prosperity it teacheth us how to use comforts, in adversity; how to want them; without this; we can neither do what is enjoyned, nor beare what is inflicted: oh then let our care be with all our gettings to get faith, and not only to get but streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then faith, since its strong faith gives us strong support in strong tryals; and in particular, that wee may with
