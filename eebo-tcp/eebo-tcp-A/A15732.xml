            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST CELEBRIOVS and famous Vniuersity of Cambridge.</head>
            <p>Ingenious and learned <hi>Academians,</hi> I do not present this my small about vnto you, intreating hereby your patronage thereof. For how can I expect so greate a fauour since most of you dissent from me in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which is here mantayned: neither as houlding this poore worke, for any art therein, worthy your iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceons vew. For I am not onely conscious to my self of myne owne weaknes: but do also grearly admyre your pearcing and cleare eyed indgmentes.</p>
            <p>To you then I exhibite it, as appealing to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (such is my confidence in your impartiall and euen censures) as Iudg betwene her sonne and my self. For wheareas my designed aduersary at this present M. Whyte, (to whom your vniuersity haith first geuen his education for literature, and since hath graced him with the inuesture of Doctorship) in answear to a Catholic Treatise (first pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by one of my fellow-labourers in the vineyard of Christ) haith written a most virulent and scandalous booke, entituling it, <hi>The way to the true Church.</hi> The which booke was fownde so full of corruptions, vntruthes, and other such baisse matter, that it was houlden in the opinion of many great and learned Preistes, rather worthy of contempt then answear.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse M. Whyte, not onely in the Preface of this said booke, but also in diuers places of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond worke, vaunteth much of his sincere dealing in the first, as particulerly pag. 129. where saying that it is the profession of Iesuites in their wryting, <hi>to rayde bookes, counterfeat, forge, and lye:</hi> he then thus ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb facs="tcp:20996:3"/>
concludeth. <hi>My aduersary can not present the Reader with one conclusion</hi> (meaning of his first book) <hi>one doctrine, one quotation, one lyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> on letter, to make him really see wherein I haue fayled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this idle venditation of ingenuity and vpright dealing, haith awakened my sleeping pen, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede haith geuen birth to this short Treatise, whear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I do vndertake to make good our former censures, that is, to demonstrate, that the very ground and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his first booke, is mere corruptions, vntruthes, and other such impostures, in the euicting of which poynt I am so secure, that I willingly make your selues Iudges both of him and me, being assured, that in a true and serious perusall of this my accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you shall synde no ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dor in Whyte, nor any of Gods spirit in him who styleth him self Gods minister, but rather in reguard of your frustrated hope, you shall haue iust reason to say of this childe (who seming Iacob, proueth Esau) <hi>Expectauimus lucem, ecce tenebra. Es.</hi> 59. which deformities of his, I am not of so rigide a Iudgement, as to ascribe to your famous vniuersity, for at this present, I do not wholly approue that como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> position of the Ciuilians, <hi>partus sequitur ventrem</hi>: And we all obserue, that those faire heauenly bodies, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring forth monsters.</p>
            <p>It is certainly reported, that desyre of praise (a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>teor</hi> ingendred in the Region of self conceate) first inuyted M. Whyte, to support forsooth, with his learned hand, the threatning and falling piller of his new Church: and thereupon he instantly stept into the number of writers, hauing thereby already gayned great applause and approbation from the wauering vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine multitude, in whose weake opinion, he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue ouerpassed most of his tyme and ranck: but I doubt not, but by the assistance of him, who <hi>In

veritate educet iudicium, Es.</hi> 42. and by the ensuing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of his calumnious forgeries, so to picke the swolne bladder of his pryde, as that all his frothy os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, shall resolue to nothing: and that his wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges (lyke vnto new found wells, being commonly of acompt onely for a yere or two) which heretofore his fauorites haue so highly estemed: shall for euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remaine contemned and neglected: which euent may well be expected since it often hapneth, that he <hi>who ryseth sodainly, faleth precipitatly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as in this following Treatise you shall be fully satisfyed of the want of his sincerity, so here I hould it not inconuenient, to geue some touch of that oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious tongue of his, which casteth most fowle and vndeserued aspersions of contumely and reproch vpon all Preistes and Catholickes. For euen in his Epistles of this his booke impugned by me, he wryteth, that the, <hi>Iesuites are the Popes Ianisaryes, that Priests are cunning seducers possessing mens wyues, &amp;c. vsing their goods to swager, and serue their owne luxurious vse, &amp; that since the Harpies were chaced away, and Bet was ouerthrowne, neuer was such a greedy and rauenous Idol as the seminary, and that friars, seminaryes, and Masse Priests, are so many beares and bloody, the Tigars, the fatall enemyes of Princes, &amp;c. that the Papists laity, doth liue in extreame ignorance, and finally that their religion teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to pay no depts, murther Kings, and tendeth cheifly to all bloody conspiracies, &amp;.</hi> Our innocency in all which pointes, one daye will discouer, when the valye of each mans actions shalbe drawne awaye, and when all deedes and thoughts shalbe plainly laid open, at what time M. Whyte, for theese and other his most false, iniurious, and vnchristian reproches must render a seuere account; only at this present our retaliation to him shalbe to saye with the <hi>Apostle</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER</head>
            <p>Good Reader, before I remit thee to the perusall of this ensuing discourse, I here thinke it good to acquaint thee with the occasion inducing me to wryte it, and with my methode houlden therein. And as touching the first, thou art to conceaue, that the worthles es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme, which we haue had of M. Whyte his booke (how soeuer his owne followers do magnify it) as see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it fraught with such impurity of stuffe, haith for theese yeares past preuailed with most of vs so far, that we weare determined to forbeare the answea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereof, houlding it altogether vnworthy of such labour; yet seing in diuerse passages of his late second worke, he vaunteth in great exultation, and iolity of words, that this his first booke doth not stand charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with any wilfull corruption, falsification, or other such imposture, and that he confidently prouoketh his aduersary (if any such be) to set them downe: Therefore to controule this mans most shamelesse as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seueration (as being one of an obdurat conscience, not caring how falsly he wryteth, or how impudently he iustifieth it being wrytten) I do here charge his said first treatise with most fowle abuses, falsifications, &amp; other such fraudulent dealing, &amp; will in theese few sheetes following particularize to thee diuerse of them, whereby thou shalt haue reason to assure thy selfe that M. Whyte, in reguarde of his calling in his new Ministery, and his exercise therein, may truly be num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bred amongest them <note n="a" place="margin">Roman. 1,</note> 
               <hi>Qui Commutauerunt verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Dei in mendacium, who changed the truth of God onto a lye.</hi> Now concerning my methode taken, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing of his falshood, and deceate, thou art to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, that my cheefe proiect in this treatise being to proue M. Whyte in his wrytings a most dishonest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionles,
<pb facs="tcp:20996:6"/>
and faithles man: therfore forbearing to confute the whole course of his booke in respect of doctrine (which is already learnedly performed by my fellowe A. D. in his reply to M. W. said worke) I do here restraine my selfe to three heads, redu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing all theese impostures, in which hereafter I intend to insist, to some of them. The heads are these Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Lyes, and Impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cyes. By Corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I meane those depraued authorityes of the auncient Fathers, and our own moderne Catholicke authours, which this our Minister (thereby to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speake in his protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant language and dialect) haith most shamelesly alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, either by inserting, or adding some words of his owne, as part of their sentences; or by concealing of some part of their words, which do expound the rest of the testimonyes, in a far different sence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, in which M. Whyte doth vrge them, or lastly (though setting downe their words truly) by strangely detorting and wresting them from the intended sence of the authors.</p>
            <p>By Lyes, I vnderstand false assertions and vast vntruthes mantained by M. White, whom the more fully, and irrepliably, and for the greater compendiousnes, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince therein, I haue made choice of those vntruthes, as are acknowledged for such by the most learned Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, thus making his mother (to wit the <hi>Vniuersity</hi>) the iudg, and his owne <hi>Brethren</hi> the plaintifs, betwene himselfe and me herein.</p>
            <p>By Impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, I conceaue his idle and fruteles aledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either of scripture, fathers, or Catholick writers, to disproue thereby some poynt of our religion; where my meaning is, that allowing the sense and constructions to those authorityes, which the wordes necessarily and truly importe, yet they doe in no sort disable &amp; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the catholicke poynt, for the impugning whereof they are there by our Minister produced, so that it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<pb facs="tcp:20996:6"/>
that his illations drawne from those testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, to the question intended, are most absurd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous, and inconsequent. These three now are the seuerall particuler deliueries of our minister, in his so much applauded worke, himselfe in this his scene, sometimes acting one part, sometimes an other, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the former heades, but wee lesse maruaile, since eich man knowes that whyte is successiuely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of seuerall tinctures. Now touching the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of these his impostures, thou art (good reader) fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vnderstand that my meaning is not to displaye all those with which his booke is stored, for this would require too painful a labour, and rising to an ouer greate volume, would be lesse fitting to be printed and diuulged. Besides, seeing my maine proiecte here is to decipher the dishonest dealing of our minister, euery cleere iudgment will acknowledg, that the true charging him euen with a few wilfull and vnius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable corruptions, doth condemne and proue him for such a man: and euery one knoweth, that who is found out of malice to corrupte some few places, would in like sorte depraue as many authorities as opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity might licence him. Therfore touching his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions or deprauations, I haue contented my selfe onely with fourty, which fourty, are taken out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout some twenty different writers, hauing in truth no more bookes alledged by him, wherewith to examine it: from which circumstance thou maist thus conclude, that if, restraining my selfe onely to twenty authours more or lesse, I can find fourty most notorious corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theyr testimonies, how many scores in all lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of such like deprauations might be found in all the rest of the authors alledged by him, which amount nere-hand to a hundred, if diligent search weare made of them: &amp; the rather considering, that many bookes produced by him, but omitted by me, are most
<pb facs="tcp:20996:7"/>
to be gotten, and therefore he might corrupte their sayinges more securely, and with greater bouldnes, as presuming beforehand, that such his corruptions through want of the bookes them selues, could not easely be espied.</p>
            <p>In like sort concerning his lyes, I haue made choyce onely of such as are all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acknowledged for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes by his owne learned brethren. From which point thou maist also thus infer; if M. Whyte his booke, doth minister sundry such grosse lyes against our catholicke faith, as that the most learned protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that euer writ, are forced (though to their owne disaduantage) to confesse them for such: How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other vntruthes might be found therein, which through some shewe, or culour of answeare, and eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, are such, (as though being lyes indeed) wil not yet be so acknowledged by our aduersaries, who are loth to confesse more in fauour of our catholicke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then the vnauoidable euidence and clearenes of the truth it selfe constrayneth them.</p>
            <p>Lastly all his impertinencies, or weake absurd reasons hereafter set downe, are taken out of lesse then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leaues of his booke, from which thou maist in like maner thus collect, that if twenty leaues, and theese in the first part of his booke (deuiding the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three partes) do afford such a boundance of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent allegations, and authorityes, how many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds then in all probability of like nature, are disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed throughout his whole treatise, it contayning a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boue two hundred leaues. And the rather, seeing that diuers authours do commonly fortify and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the first part of their wrytings, with more forcible proofes and authorities then the latter part, both thereby the sooner, and with greater speede to inuade the iudgment of the reader, as also knowing, that
<pb facs="tcp:20996:7"/>
many do peruse the beginninges of bookes, who through a werisome carelesnes do neuer reade the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of them.</p>
            <p>And thus much of my methode in this my treatise. Here now thou seest (curteous reader) what I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to performe, that is to make euident, that M. Whyte his first booke is stored with most shameles fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifications, lyes, and other such collusions: the which if I doe not effect, I am content to become a reproche, and shame, not onely to my particuler profession (the sacred function whereof I hould my cheefest honour) but also to the Catholicke cause in generall; for here I protest in the sight of god, and as I shall answere the truth or falshood of this my protestation at the most dreadfull daye, that I neuer perused booke of this quantity, wherein I did find more vnanswereable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, lyes, and impertinencies, then in this worke of M. Whytes. And if so eminent a man (as he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by many to be) doth stand cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>geable with such prophane, and wicked deportments: what shall we then censure of other inferiour wryters of his side, Since <note n="b" place="margin">Math. c 6.</note> 
               <hi>if the light be darknes, how great is the darknes</hi>: or what may we iudg of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> iustnes of their cause seeing the faith of Christ is of that force, as it scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be vphoulden with the weake supporters of such deceatfull meanes, it being no better, then an impious deuotion, or irreligious godlines, to deferd truth with falshood, or to blaze forth the light of the gospel, by the workes of darknes? And as touching his second booke, which is fraughted with all base scurrility of wordes, and railing, I will onely say, that seing there hath not bene as yet sufficient opportunity for the particuler examining of it, yet I am assured, that who shall impose that labour to himself, shall find the same to stand chargeable with no lese store
<pb facs="tcp:20996:8"/>
of impostures, then this his other: for if this his booke impugned by me (being the strength and first borne of his cause) be found so corrupt, how can we proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly coniecture that this other second feminine, and lesse perfect labour of his, should not pertake of the former blemishes and deficiences.</p>
            <p>But now good reader, I will detaine thee no longer from perusing this my accusation, earnestly entreating thee (euen for the good of thy soule) that if thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand latin, thou wouldest see the testimonies them selues, as they lye in the authours, the which I doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch to be here corrupted, which if thou dost, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly thou shalt be forced to confesse, that M. whyte is a most egregious falsary, and howsoeuer he ename<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his cause, with the phrazes of <hi>the waye to the true Church, of the enlarging of the Ghospell of Christ, of roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out superstition and blindnes,</hi> and the like, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lesse thou shalt find that he is most conscious, and guilty both of his owne weake cause, as also of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious, and prophane mantaining and defending of the same, so as in reguard of his hipocrisy, and dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herein, thou shalt see the wordes of the apostle iustified in him <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> 
               <hi>all they are not Israell, which are of Israell,</hi> himselfe being one of those <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 13.</note>

                     <p>WE reade (<hi>Exod.</hi> 13) that the first borne of the people of Israell, was euer consecrated vnto god in regard of a gratefull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his innumerable benefites shewed vnto them: and by reason of such his tytle thereto, god (who had a supreme interest in all theire issue) peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly pronounced, <hi>This is myne.</hi> I feare that M. Whyte (who vaunteth him selfe for a true Israelite) haith not sanctified vnto his diuyne Maiesty, this his child, the first borne of the wombe of his braine, for bookes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20996:14"/>
are <hi>faetus ingenii,</hi> carying in them selues an inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance to theire parentes, and withall as perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their remembrance, doe extende their lynes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their liues: Nay I am rather perswaded that he haith particulerly deuoted it to Gods and mans ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemy. For to whom rather are lyes and impostures (the very burden of his Treatise) to be ascribed, then to him who is the father of lyes? And sure I am that God who is the truth it selfe can not be found herein since no man vseth to gather <hi>grapes of thornes, or figgs of thistles.</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.) And M. Whyte him selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that <hi>we can not learne truth in the schoole of lyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to discouer that this worke of his is euen loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with many most foule vntruthes, corruptions, and deceiptes, is my taske voluntarily imposed by my selfe and I hope with thy good patience (gentle reader) to performe the same.</p>
                     <p>And first according to my former prescribed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, his perfidious corruptions of fathers &amp; Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Authoures, thereby to force them to speake in a language and dialect of which they were merely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, shall begin the Scene.</p>
                     <p>But because as M. Whyte is pregnant in depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of mens writinges, so also he will no doubt shew him selfe ingenious in fynding some sleighty euasions and answeares, vnder the tecture whereof to shrewde him selfe. Therefore I thinke good now in the front and beginning of this my labour, to set downe by way of preuention, all what may be imagined that he can pretende for his defence and Apology, and to discouer the weaknes thereof, that so his impostures may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and perused with greater benefite to the reader, and more shamefull guiltinesse to him selfe.</p>
                     <p>First then M. Whyte can not transferr the fault v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20996:14"/>
the printer for heare he standes for the most part chargeable either with adding too, or detracting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the authority alledged (so abastarding it by this meane that the true father thereof would not acknowledg it for his owne) whereas the printers errour comonly resteth in quotations made by figures, or (by mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of some letter) in placing one woord for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ouer-sightes heare forborne, and indeede vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be insisted vpon by any iuditious penne.</p>
                     <p>Secondly he can not say that his intention in alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging such authorities, was onely to alledg the sense of the Authour not tying him selfe to the authoures per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler wordes. Of this euasion he preuenteth him selfe in that he euer vndertaketh to alledg the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer sayings of the Authour, and for that reason doth distinguish them in a different letter from that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his owne wordes are printed (a course amongst writers most certaine and vsuall to know when a man deliuereth the precise wordes or sentences of an other) and which is more for the most part he thus vshereth his testimonies, <hi>Bellarmine saith, Thomas Aquinas saith, Austine saith, &amp;c.</hi> or putteth their names in the mergent: whereby it is not to be doubted but that he would haue his reader thinke, that the Authorities set downe, are the very wordes of the Authoures them selues, without any variation or chang whatsoeuer.</p>
                     <p>Now if he will iustify them to be the precise words of the Authoures without any chang either of adding or detracting: then is he to name the perticuler Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of such bookes which he foloweth, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the testimonies (as they are alledged by him) are to be found.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly where he is charged to corrupt any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by concealing for his owne aduantage any part

thereof, he can not iustify it by replyinge, that he is not tyed to set downe all which his Authour saith of that poynt, since so his Authorities would grow ouer longe and tedious: this is no sufficient answeare. For although a writer is not bound to set downe all that his alledged Authour saith of such a point: yet is he bound not purposly to omitt any part of the beginning of the middest, or of the ending of the said sentences which he produceth, especially when the wordes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed make for his aduersary, and against the drifte and scope of that meaning wherein the reste of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is by him deliuered. And this kind of omission (wherevnto M. Whyte standeth extremely obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and is in this part folowing so by me charged) is in the iudgment of all writers, a wilfull, vnpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, &amp; vniustifiable corrupting of mens bookes.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly it is no excuse to say, touching such autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rities as M. Whyte truly alledgeth without adding or detracting (of which kind there are very few if any) that his meaning is onely to set downe the wordes of Catholick Authoures without restrayning them to any perticuler sence which he leaueth to that daungerous and inconuenient exposition which the wordes in the readers eye may best seme to afford. This is most false, for there is no Catholick which he iustifyeth, but he perticularly restraineth the sence of his testimony either to the supporting of some point of protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, or els to the manteyning of some absurde and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous opinion which he obtrudeth vpon vs. And thus much, besides the often answearable entituling of the pages, his owne precedent or subsequent wordes, do, for the most part, imply.</p>
                     <p>Fyftly, if his pryde would suffer him to descende so low, he can not plaster the marter in acknowledginge
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20996:15"/>
that the testimonies heare corrupted, are not of his owne reading, but that he relyed therein vpon the an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>notations and note-bokes of others of the ministery (a refuge wherunto some of his profession haue bene here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tofore driuen) and so as being ouer credulous and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fident of his frendes supposed allegations, he was by them mistaken. Of this sily &amp; poore euasion, he haith already precluded him selfe. For in his first Edition (which I here folow) after his Alphabeticall Table in the end of his booke, he haith made an ambitious note to the reader, that <hi>he will</hi> (to vse his owne wordes) <hi>mantaine the quotations for substance to be true &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>it is one thing if I haue wilfully falsifyed or forged a place, and an other thing if the printer onely haith mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the quotation: the latter may be, but the former is not, as I will be ready to satisfy any that will charge me with it.</hi> Thus he. But how mantaineth he the point, or what satisfaction geueth he, if in answere to the corruptions and deprauations wherewith he is heare charged, he reply, that in good sooth so it is that he did not read the testimonies of the Authoures them selues, but onely tooke them vpon the credit and affiance of such of his owne brother-hood as he thought would not haue deceiued him? A graue &amp; sufficient answeare.</p>
                     <p>And heare I am to preadmonishe M. Whyte, that I doe expect in his answeare (if he doe intende sincerely and truly to free him selfe from these imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) to answeare all the corruptions and deprauati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by them selues as heare they are gathered, and so the lyes and falshoodes seuerally by them selues; as as also the impertinences in like sort, and not promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously to iumble and shuffle them together, now seeking to salue a corruption, next a lye, and so by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting an obscurity, in methode, to bleare the eye of the reader that he shall not discerne what corruptions
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20996:16"/>
in his reply he omitteth, and what he maketh shew to iustify; wherefore I say if he make choice of this ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>scure course after this premonition, he but bewrayes his owne guiltinesse. And though I can not by the lawes of writing impose a methode vpon my aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries pen: yet seing the reason why M. Whyte should affect an other course then I heare wish him, is seene aforehand, and so him self hereby aduertised thereof, to be onely (by answearing so confusedly) to delude and wrong his reader: therefore euen for his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and credit sake, he can not refuse this desyred methode which heare I requyre, especially seing it is wished onely for manifestation of the truth, as being in it selfe most obuious, facile, &amp; perspicuous.</p>
                     <p>Thus much I haue thought good (for his greater caution) to instruct the reader with afore-hand; and therefore now I will remitt him to the ensuing depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, still wishing him to haue his eye (whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer M. Whyte shall vouchsaife to make answeare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) intent and fixed vpon the corruption obiected: neither suffer him to turne the question (as before I touched) from the corruption, to the sence &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Authour (a sleight vpon the lyke occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vsed by Plessis against the Bishoppe of Fureux) &amp; so to entertaine the reader with long discourses there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diuert his myud from the point in question: but let the reader alwayes remember, that the question heare for the most part immediatly is, whether such a sentence or testimony is truly and faithfully alledged as it is to be found in the Authour him selfe, without any addition or concealement of wordes in M. White his behalfe, and so breefely whether M. Whyte cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth the place or not, still obseruing that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer M. Whyte saith, if it do not conclude that the testimony is in noe sort altered and changed from the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20996:16"/>
wordes of the Authour him selfe, is (in respecte of the point here handled) but idly, extrauagantly, &amp; impertinently spoken.</p>

                     <p>BVT now at the last to come to M. Whytes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauations the which (for more perspicuity) I will range to certaine heades: the first whereof shall be such as concerne the doctrine of workes and iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication And to begin with one which as it contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in it self many foule and strang corruptions: so the iniury thereby offered is not to one but to many and those men for their learning and vertue, of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest memory, to wit, the english Doctors of <hi>Rhemes</hi> who (if we may beleue M. Whyte pag. 238.) feare not to affirme that our <hi>workes of their very nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue eternall lyfe, the reward whereof is a thing equally &amp; iustly answearing to the tyme and weight of the worke rather then a free guift, so that God should be vniust if he gaue it not.</hi> And for this he quoteth in his mergent. <hi>Rhem. Annot. vpon</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. &amp; <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 10. But for the plainest and most certaine discouery of this brasen faced minister, I will set downe the true wordes of the Rhemistes, who commenting vpon those of S. Paule (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8) <hi>And euery one shall receaue his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward according to his owne labour,</hi> wryte as foloweth. <hi>A most plaine text to proue that men by their laboures &amp; by the diuersities thereof shall be diuersly rewarded in heauen: and therefore that by their workes proceding of GRACE, they deserue or merit heauen.</hi> Here before I procede any further, I must charge M. Doctor with a dooble cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, first for omitting the word Grace, the true
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20996:17"/>
wordes being <hi>workes proceding of Grace, do deserue or merit heauen:</hi> secondly, which maketh it more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable and damnable, for inserting in steed of the word <hi>Grace,</hi> the word <hi>Nature,</hi> the which was not so much as dreamed of by the Rhemistes, or by any Catholick Author, yea to defend that workes of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do merite, were to renew the heresy long since condemned in the Pelagians by the Romane Church.</p>
                     <p>But to goe forward, the Rhemistes in this ministers mouth affirme, that <hi>the reward is a thing equally &amp; iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answearing to the tyme and weight of the worke, rather then a free guifte.</hi> But in their owne wordes they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch the contrary. <hi>And indeede</hi> (say they) <hi>this word Reward which in our english tongue may signify a voluntary or bountifull guift, doth not so well expresse the nature of the latin word, or the greeke, which are rather the very stipend that the hyred workman or iournay ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> couenanteth to haue of him whose worke he doth, and is a thing equally and iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answearing to the tyme and weight of his trauels and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes (in which sence the Scripture saith</hi> The worke-man is worthy of his hyre) <hi>rather then a free guift: though because faithfull men must acknowledg that their merites be the guiftes and graces of god, they rather vse the word Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then hyre, stipend, or repayment. &amp;c.</hi> Now all that from hence can be gathered are two thinges, first that the Rhemists affirme that the word Reward, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin and greeke, doth rather signify a <hi>stipend or hyre then a free guift.</hi> Secondly that because <hi>faithfull men must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that their merites be the guiftes and graces of god, they rather vse the word Reward then hyre.</hi> But now all this whyle I can not fynde this sentence cyted by M. Wh. that <hi>the reward of workes is a thing equally &amp; iustly answearing to the tyme and weight of the worke rather then a free guift.</hi> Indeede I fynd most of the wordes, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them in seuerall lynes, and vttered vpon seuerall

occasions, all which to ioyne and chaine together in one continued lyne or sentence, and thereby to make the Authour speake contrary to him selfe, is a thing ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy to performe, but the performance is wicked, shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and execrable.</p>
                     <p>And geue but this libertie of omitting, inserting, &amp; coopling to the Atheist (which your self M.

                     <p>But now to obserue M. Whytes calumny &amp; fraude in alledging this testimony. First he purposly concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the latter part of the sentence which sheweth how we ascribe our iustification to Christ, as vnwilling that the reader should heare that in any sence we rely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly that whereas this testimony of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinales, euen as it is set downe by M. Whyte him self, excludeth onely Christes merites as the formall cause of our iustification and in none other sence: yet our minister alledgeth it to proue that it is no cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at all, &amp; in this respect it is impertinently vrged, for in his owne wordes immediatly before, without any limitation of the cause, he saith, <hi>The Church of Rome teacheth that iustification of a sinner is done by the ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bite of our owne righteousnes &amp; not by Christes.</hi> And then as I said, alledgeth for proofe thereof such wordes of Bellarmine as excludeth onely the formall cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But his sleight here was, that perswading him self
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20996:19"/>
that the ignorant reader not knowing what the word <hi>formall cause</hi> is, or how it is distinguished from other kinde of causes, but thinking that it did signify any cause in generall, should no sooner see the wordes of Bellarmine, but then should instantly conclude with him self, here Bellarmine &amp; the Church of Rome tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that <hi>mans iustification is in no sort or maner wrought by the iustice of Christ.</hi> And thus much of our Doctors deportement herein, who through his subtill feaninge (at his pleasure) what we are supposed to mantaine, doth in the meane tyme endanger and wrong the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the worthy and illustrious Cardinall till more full search and disquisition of the truth be made.

confirming and mantaininge the doctrine of merits. Againe what impudency is it in M.

                     <p>The Fathers wordes are these, which I will relate at large in latin for the more full discouery of M. Whites demeanour therein. <hi>Ista nostra iustitia (quamnis vera sit propter veri boni finem ad quem refertur) tamen tauta est in hac vita vt potius peccatorum remissione constet, quam perfectione virtutum.</hi> This our iustice (though it be true by reason of the end of the true good to which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred) yet it is such in this life as that it rather consis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our sinnes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the perfection of vertues. Here first our minister addeth the word, <hi>all,</hi> for greater swelling and fulnes of speach against our doctrine, which is not in S. Augustine: but this we let passe as a smaller fault. Secondly he leaueth owt a parcell of the same sentence, to wit (<hi>although our Ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice be true by reason of the end of the true good whereunto it is referred</hi>) in which wordes S. Augustine acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the very Catholick doctrine of iustification, to witt, that our Iustice is true Iustice, against which this very place is vrged. Thirdly he falsly translateth (for his owne aduantage) those wordes, <hi>quam perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione virtutum,</hi> then in any perfection of Iustice, where it shoud be, then in any perfection of vertues. This he did to make S. Augustines wordes sound in an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant eare more clearely against Iustice &amp; Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mantayned by Catholickes.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as longe as it is exercysed in commaunding and ouerru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vyce, man haith not perfect peace.</hi> But to ende this subiect of Iustification, here you see how dexterously our minister haith borne him selfe, who for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning of the same, haith seuerall wayes abused the sentences of his Authors, somtimes by insertions of his owne as if they were the Authors wordes: som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by taking away and concealing what is there plainely set downe: othertimes, though the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be truly alledged, yet by violent detortinge and wresting the place from the true intended sence, yea often when the very place strongly fortifyeth that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick point or doctrime against which it is theare brought.

                     <p>IT being a certaine truth that from Scriptures euill vnderstoode procede most heresies, M.

hereof that S. Hierome was noe papiste, which how true it is, I will onely for this present appeale vnto this Epitaph of S. Paula writen by this holy Doctor to the Virgin <hi>Eustochium</hi> and here cyted by our protestant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister: whereby if it do not plainely appeare by sundry pointes of religion there mentioned and practised that S. Hierome, <hi>S. Paula,</hi> and the Bishops, Preistes, and people of those tymes were of the same Religion or beleefe which Catholickes now professe, and protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes impugne: that then let me be enrolled in the black bill of lying ministers, or coopled in brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood with Whyte, as a legitimate sonne of the father of lyes.</p>
                     <p>First then S. Hierome vndertaking to set downe the blessed lyfe and death of the holy woman S. Paula, in proofe of his sincere proceding therein, maketh this protestation. <hi>I call Iesus to witnes and his Sainctes, yea that very Angell who was keeper and companion of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable woman, that I will speake nothing in her fauour, or after the maner of flaterers, but for a testimony, and that which is lesse then her merites, whom the whole worlde doth praise, preistes admyre, quiers of virgins desyre, and troupes of Monkes and poore people bewayle.</hi> Is the inuocation of Sainctes and Angells which of necessity supposeth their knowledg? is the beleefe of euery mannes proper An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell to guard him? and quiers or companies of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and Monkes, plaine proofes of Catholick or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant religiou?</p>
                     <p>To procede, S.

mouth the very place of the body wheare our Lord had laid.</hi> Then <hi>hauing visited the pillour at the which our Lorde was bound and whipped, and the place where the holy Ghost did descend vpon the faithfull: she went to Bethelem, where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring our Sauiours caue, and looking at the holy Iune of the Virgin, and the stable,</hi> after many other deuout speaches she vttered these wordes. <hi>And I wretch and sinner am thought worthy to kisse the manger in which our Lord a litle babe cryed, and to pray in the caue in which the Virgin brought forth our Lord an infant.</hi> After this amongst sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other holy places, she went vnto the <hi>Sepulchres of the</hi> 12 <hi>Patriarches where she trembled beinge affrighted with many wonders, for she saw the diuells roare being dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly tormented: and before the sepulchres of the Sainctes she saw men howling lyke wolues, barking lyke dogs, roaringe lyke lyons, hissing lyke serpentes, and belowing lyke buls &amp;c.</hi> And is not all this with a protestant papisticall super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition? Will our Whyte allow of pilgrimage to holy places? or will he with S. <hi>Paula</hi> prostrate him selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Crosse and worshipe? will he kisse sacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques? or will he attribute such sanctity to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres of Sainctes that in presence thereof diuells are tormented?

In her greatest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues she vsed not soft beds, but reposed on the hard grounde couered with hayre clothes &amp;c. Thou wouldest haue thought fountaines of teares to haue proceded from her: yea she so bewayled litle sinnes as that thou wouldest haue iudged her guilty of greatest crimes &amp;c. Soft linnens &amp; pretious silkes she changed with a sharpe hayre cloth &amp;c.</hi> Her loue of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty was such, as that she <hi>desyred she might dye a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and not to leaue one peny to her daughter, yea her selfe at her death to be wrapped in an others sheete.</hi> And as for her dyet, her abstinence was such, as that (<hi>festiuall dayes excepted) she scarce tooke oyle in her meate, by which may be iudged (saith S. Ierome) what she thought of wyne, of any thinges molted, of fish, milke, hony, egs, and the rest which are pleasant to tast.</hi> If I should now aske Maister Whyte whether his wyfe for example being no doubt an Euangelicall sister of highest perfection, him self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often absent about preaching of the worde, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I say, in his conscience he thinketh her modesty such, as that at such tymes (to speake sparingly) shee doth not often both eate and drinke with his Clarcke and other neighboures: as also whether for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of the flesh and the quickning of the spirit, she changeth a soft bed into the hard ground, or fyne lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens into hayre-cloth: and in breife whether without all exceptions of dayes, not fish, milke, or egs, but the daintiest flesh and most delicate wyne, be meates most welcome to him and her? I doubt not but he will answeare me that none of these agreeth with the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these tymes. But thereto then must I needes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that therefore neither must he be much greued if his foresaid yokefelow grow wanton in the lord, hard bed, hayre cloth, and fasting (the best externall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiues against such impurities) being vtterly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20996:24"/>
And yet if the lyke question should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vnto me in regard of Catholickes, all Christian Countries would answeare with me, that the said aus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terities of B. <hi>Paula</hi> are not onely imitated &amp; practised by Religious persons, but euen by wiues, widowes, &amp; Virgins which liue in the world.</p>
                     <p>But to touch yet one point further, wherein I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all protestantes will disclaime as being incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with theire new gospels libertie, which was <hi>S. Paula</hi> her Monasticall lyfe, whereof S. Hierome saith, <hi>I will speake of the order of her Monastery &amp;c. Besydes the Monastery of men which she had geuen to men to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, she deuyded the Virgins &amp;c. aswell noble, as of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and lowest degree, into three companies and Monas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries &amp;c. After Alleluia song or sounded, (by which signe they were called to Collect or prayer) it was not lawfull for any of them to stay &amp;c. In the morning, at the Third houre, at the Sixt, the Ninth, Euen song, and Midnight, they song the Psalter by order or course.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now foloweth Whytes proofe of theire protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, <hi>neither was it lawfull for any of the Sisters to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Psalmes, or not to learne somthing daily out of the sacred Scriptures.</hi> But what is this against vs, who allow not onely Religious women such as these weare, (Whom M. Whyte most fraudulently calleth Paules maydes) but euen the laity to reade the Scriptures, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing they be knowne to be humble, discreete, and vertuous. And yet in what maner <hi>S. Paula</hi> her self, &amp; her daughter <hi>Eustochium</hi> being both well learned, did it, S. Hierome a litle after expresseth in these wordes. <hi>She forced me that together with her Daughter, she might read the old and new Testament, I declaring it: (me disserente) which in modesty denying, yet through her importunities and often intreaties, I performed, that so I might teach what I had learned, not of my self, that is presumption the worste

                     </p>
                     <p>Would not any man think this minister distracted, thus producing against vs that which confoundeth him self? Do not these Religious women in reading of the Scriptures requyre S. Hierome a Preist for their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster? Doth not he professe to teach them, not what he had learned himself, or from many imaginary spirit, but from the <hi>famous men or Doctors of the Church</hi>? Yea doth not he plainely and humbly acknowledg his doubting and ignorance in his explication thereof; none of which I am sure is orthodoxall with protestants.</p>

Their seperation from men was such, as she seuered them euen from Eunuches. Besides sustenance and apparel, she suffered them not to possesse any thing. Such as were talkatyue &amp; vnquiet, she caused (in penance) to pray at the doare of the refectory &amp; to eate alone.</hi>

proue by the Rhemistes confession, that the Church may somtymes be inuisible: and yet in this very place being truly set downe in their owne wordes, they doe affirme that the Church shall at no tyme be inuisible. Theire true wordes are these. <hi>It is very lyke (be it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnder correction of Gods Church and all learned Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes) that this great defection and reuolt, shall not be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Romane Empyre, but especially from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, and withall from most pointes of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (not that the Catholick Christians either in the tyme of Antichrist or before, shall refuse to obey the same, but) for that neare to the tyme of Antichrist and consummation of the worlde, there is lyke to be a greate reuolt of Kingdomes, people, and Prouinces, from the open externall obedience &amp; communion thereof. &amp;c. when for the few dayes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christes reigne, the externall state of the Romane Church, and publick entercourse of the faithfull with the same way cease (yet the due honour and obedience of Christians towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des it, and Communion in heart with it, and practise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in secret and open confession thereof (if occasion requyre) shall not cease, no more then it doth now in the Christians of Cyprus and other places where open entercourse is forbidden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here now the parcels of this testimony which are purposly omitted, do show that the Rhemistes do euen peremptorily affirme that gods Church shall neuer (no not in the tyme of Antichristes greatest persecutions) be latent and inuisible. Thus doth our M. you see v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a sudaine breake of with the Rhemistes in alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their wordes: yet after some lyne or two curteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioyneth with them againe, and then after that once more vnkindly leaues them to them selues: &amp; all this in one poore testimony. And here good reader thou art to take notice of an other sleight of our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster touching this particuler place. For whereas he in the first Edition of his booke, which I here folow, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20996:28"/>
downe the Rhemistes wordes, as thou seest aboue, in no sorte intimating that any one word of their said testimony is pretermitted: he in some other of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions (as it should seme being aduertised that this his egregious corruption was espyed by his aduersaries, &amp; thought therefore in some sort to salue the matter) haith at the last wordes where he breaketh of from the rest of the whole sentence, added a virgula, or lyne as this,—ingeniously forsoth to acknowledge that he omitteth some part of the sentence. But this I say auaileth him nothing: for first it doth not warrant his sincerity in his first Edition. Againe, though in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of a testimony we are not bound to set down e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery word thereof, yet (as I haue before premonished) that which is omitted ought to be impertinent to the mayne point for which the testimony is produced.

                     <p>M.

Cardinal Bellarmine as saying. <hi>They make it not euidently true, that is the Church, but euidently probable.</hi> Here M. D. as it semes wanted lantorne and candle light: but most certainely he wanted either honesty, or knowledg, or both: in best confirmation whereof, I will onely set downe the wordes of Bellarmine him selfe <hi>de notes eccl. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 3. <hi>Est autem initio obseruandum, Ecclesiam Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicam esse &amp;c. It is in the beginning to be obserued that the Catholick Church is a Soon which on euery side powreth out the clearest beames of light, so that by them she may most easely be knowne. For she haith many Markes or testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and signes which discerneth her from all false religions of Paganes, Iewes, Heritykes. And they do not make it euidently true that she is the true Church of God, but yea they make it euidently `credible: for that is said euidently true that is seene either in it self or in it principles: that is said euidently credible which is not seene either in it selfe or in it principles, yet</hi> (which) <hi>haith so many, and so graue Testimonies, as that euery wyse man deseruedly ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue it.</hi>

                     <p>But speake M.

                     <p>Againe, to our more depressing of faith, &amp; our sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed aduancing of ignorance: the Doctor telleth his Reader how among vs the lay people are not bound to know, what the matters of their faith be, but that <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is better</hi>: and thereupon in his mergent he forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth him self with a sentence of Bellarmine <hi>de Inst. l.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 7. in these wordes. <hi>Fides melins per ignorantia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quam per notitiam, definitur.

Wherefore I say that M. Whyte dealeth vnchristianlyke, and most ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religiously with Bellarmine herein. For first he inues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his wordes (which are spoken onely of the nature of faith) with a new construction neuer dreamed of: and therefore you see the minister (besides his passing ouer the ground and reason of his sentence) purpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitteth in his translation, the beginning of the se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence alledged, though it doth expound the wordes following, to wit, <hi>Therefore we beleue the misteries of Faith (which are aboue reason) we vnderstand them not, and in this respect Faith is distinguished against science.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly he taketh aduauntage in translating the word <hi>notitia,</hi> which though it signifyeth in large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction knowledg in generall (in which sence he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw the ignorant reader would take it) yet with the schoolemen it is restrayned, as Bellarmine here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly noteth, to that kynd of knowledg which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>Scientia,</hi> which procedeth out of a demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble euidency of the thing knowen, and consequently it is incompatible with Faith.</p>
                     <p>For shame of your owne credit M.

And that at the tyme when it was writen, <hi>Sinesius</hi> was but a Lay man, yet very eminent for diuers kyndes of good literature, and in reguard of such his partes, he was much solicited by many to vndertake the function of Preisthood: he a longe tyme yelded not to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, and did wryte this very Epistle to <hi>Euopius,</hi> (who was one that wished him to that course) to iustify hereby his resolution not to make him self Preist. And in this Epistle amonge other of his reasons, as his loue to humane studies, and his temporall pleasures diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him from that course, he alledgeth the wordes here set downe by M.

                     <p>Now what do you say to this M.

Wherefore good Reader, I am to intreate thy patience, if I insist somwhat longe in the full disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of this corruption. Well then Bellarmine in the Chapiter alledged, sheweth how that God may be said seuerall wayes to inclyne a man to euill: And there upon saith. <hi>Primus modus esset, si Dens per se &amp; proprié &amp;c. The first way should be, if god by him self and properly either physicé, phisically and naturally by mouing the will im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mediatly, or moraliter, to wit, by truly and properly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding the will, should impell it to euill: but this kind is manifestly false, impious and blasphemous against God. Therefore this kind as wicked being omitted, a second way as that we may vnderstand god to be said in the Scriptures, to excyte and prouoke some vnto euill, or to commaunde that they work wickedly, and to vse them as instrumentes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he permitteth them to do euill, although euery one that permitteth any thing, can not be rightly said to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund it, that it may be done, neither to excite or prouoke an other thereto. Notwithstanding god (without whose permission nothing can be done) when as he suffereth any thing to be done, to the obtayning of some certayne ende of hit: may rightly be said by a certaine figure, to commaund that, and to incite one thereto: euen as vsually we say, the dog was set vpon the hare by the hunter, when as he onely loosed the slippe wherewith he was tyed.</hi> And then some three paragraphes after, <hi>deus non so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20996:52"/>
Bellarmine onely by illation, applyeth thereto.

Fourthly when Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine after saith, that <hi>god inclynes also the will of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to one euill rather then to an other, positiué, non quidem per se et phisicé mouendo voluntatem ad vnum, et remouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ab alio, quod libertati arbitru praeiudicare videtur: sed occasionaliter et moraliter, positiuely, yet not by him selfe and phisically, mouing the will of the wicked to one sinne, &amp; withdrawing it from an other, which may seeme to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the freedome of the will, but occasionally &amp; morally &amp;c.</hi> Our minister subtily taking hould of the word <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiuê,</hi> doth leaue out all the rest, wherein is expressed how the word <hi>positiuè,</hi> is to be vnderstoode, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it immediatly with the wordes <hi>occasionaliter, et mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliter.</hi> Fiftly he purposly forbeareth the example wher in Bellarmine immediatly doth interprete the wordes <hi>occasionaliter &amp; moraliter,</hi> to wit, in sending a good thought, but not an euill thought, as M.

That this Place of S. Augustine is onely intended of in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fants not baptised before their death, is also manifested (besides the proofe taken from the former wordes) by that which this Father wryteth some two or three lines afore this place, where he maketh the question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning reprobation and perticulerly restraineth this speach to infantes in these wordes, <hi>Quomod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For who not distracted, would vrge that against his aduersary which impugneth him self, and that in such a maner, as will easely conuince him of fraude and wilfull malice. For fiirst S. Gregory in the place cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, reproueth Serenus for breaking &amp; casting downe of Images which were set vp in Churches, though the said Serenus did the same through zeale, by reason of some who committed Idolatry thereby, affirming fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that therefore <hi>Pictures are vsed in Churches, that those which know not letters, at least should reade by seeing in the wales, those thinges which they could not reade in bookes.</hi> And then he concludeth. <hi>Thy brotherhood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to haue preserued the pictures, and to haue hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the people from their adoration, that so the ignorant might haue from whence to gather knowledg of the history, and the people not sinne in adoration of the picture</hi>:</p>

Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Images, is onely that adoration which is proper to god.</p>
                     <p>And that otherwise he thought Images duly to be worshipped, appeareth by his 7. booke and 5. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, wheare wryting to Bishop Ianuarius concerning one Peter lately conuerted from Iudaisine to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, who violently had taken a Sinagoug from the Iewes, and <hi>placed therein the Image of the Mother of God and our Lord, and the venerable Crosse &amp;c.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse whereof he exhortethe the said Bishope, that <hi>the Image and the Crosse taken away againe from thence, with that veneration</hi> (or reuerence) <hi>which it meete, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store that which was violently taken away,</hi> to wit the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagouge.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20996:55"/>
So that in steed of impugning due worship to Images, these poyntes folowing may all heritikes learne of S. Gregory. First, that he proueth the vse thereof from antiquity. Secondly, that he alloweth the placing thereof in Churches, and impugneth the breakers or pullers of them downe, though their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse or pretence, be feare of Idolatry in the People. Thirdly that the same, in steed of hurt, do much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the ignorant that can not reade. And lastly that in plaine tearmes he calleth the Crosse, <hi>Crucem veneran dam, Venerable.</hi> And directeth, that both the Image of our B. Lady, and the Crosse, should be remoued, <hi>cum ea qua dignum est veneratione, with that worship which is meete,</hi> or they deserue. So that I could wish our needy minister, to be better aduysed hereafter in his citinge of S. Gregory against Catholick religion.</p>

                     <head>The 5 Paragraph. The Councell of Eliberis corrupted against Images.</head>
                     <p>Here now I am come to the last corruption, which I intende to display, the which I haue purposly reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, therewith to close vp the taist of my Reader: so notorious it is for the Authors depraued, and so preg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant and dextrous in the conueyance.</p>
                     <p>As touching the first, whearas euery one of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer deprauations (those of the Rhemistes onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) resteth in abusing the authority of some one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler man, this stryketh at a whole Councell consis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of many scores of Fathers, so happy a progresse M. Whyte haith made in his profession of corrupting. Now for the conueyance, though it be not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled with diuers of the former, <hi>extensiué</hi> (as the schoole-men speake) in multitude and stoare of wordes
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20996:56"/>
corrupted, it lying onely in slye transposition of one or two wordes, yet <hi>intensiué,</hi> for the art thereof, it may be equalled with any.</p>
                     <p>This then it is. Our minister there, pag 344. to ouerthrow the religious vse of Images, produceth the 36. Canon of the Councell of Eliberis, to wit: <hi>No picture is to be made in the Church, lest that be adored which is paynted on wales.</hi> The wordes of the Canon are these. <hi>Placuit picturas in Ecclesia non debere, ne quod co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litur &amp; adoratur, in partetibus depingatur. It pleased the Councell, that pictures should not be in the Church, leste that which is worshipped and adored, be painted on the wales.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Be obseruant here Reader, and marke the difference which is made of the same wordes, by a witty inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of their place in their translation: &amp; thou shalt see that my delicate minister here euen transcends him self. The Councell saith, <hi>Images are not to be in the Church, lest that be painted on the wales which is worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</hi> M. Whyte translateth, <hi>lest that be worshipped which is painted on the wales.</hi> Thus the difference breefely resteth in this, <hi>lest that which is worshiped be painted,</hi> And <hi>lest that which is painted be worshipped.</hi> A small diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in shew of wordes, but great in sence: For the wordes of the Councell acknowledging the worship of Images, maketh the worship due to them, to be the cause why they are not to be painted on wales: But M. Whyte saith that they are not to be painted on wales because they are not to be worshiped, and so maketh the Councell to speake lyke good protestantes.</p>
                     <p>Now the reason why the Councell would not haue the wales of Churches to be painted with Images, was in reguard of the due respect they bare to them, &amp; not as M. Whyte falsly suggesteth: For being so painted, they were subiect to be defaced, either by the inuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the enemies in those tymes, or els by the rayne and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20996:56"/>
bad wether: whereas Images drawne in Tables (of which the former Councell maketh no restraint) in that they are portable and remoueable, do not lye open to the same daunger. Therefore the intention of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell herein, was the same with the intention of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree by the which it was ordained, that in reuerence to the Crucifix, no Crosse should be made vpon the plaine ground, because it being so made, must needes be often irreuerently be tramped with the feete of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus is M. Whyte in seking to disproue the lawfull vse of an Image, become him self a perfect Image of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceate, fraude, and collusion.</p>
                     <p>But here now I make an ende of his corruptions &amp; deprauations (hasting my self to the second Part of his scene which is his lyes and falshoods.) Onely I must say, that in reguard of the impurity and conse onlesse deportment of him in his whole Treatise: I can not but commiserate all such poore credulous soules, as do highly Preiudge of his booke, as beiug writen in all sincerity and plainesse, and free from the least touch or aspersion of any wilfull deprauation.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I hould it most strange, that M. <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase</hi> (a scholer and ingenious, though extremely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuolent) should in his owne booke, pag. 100. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tytle M. Whyte <hi>Via Lactea,</hi> alludinge perhaps both to his name, and his supposed candor in wrytinge.</p>
                     <p>But since his mistakinge is not iustifiable: I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to M. Whyte the same tytle, though through a differeut reason. For as the <hi>Via Lactea</hi> appeareth to a vulgar sight to be a part of heauen, and yet indeede is not, being (if we follow the iudgment of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Philosophers) far lower then the heauens, as it is necessarily euicted from the different parallayes and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations thereof, taken from seuerall places: So is M. Whyte reputed in the comon eye and censure of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20996:57"/>
protestantes, as a man which in all truth haith much laboured in that heauenly course of dilating the Gospell and faith of Christ: whereas we fynd that the contrary is most true, as haith fully appeared from his seuerall exorbitant deprauations of so many Catholick Authors and others. Wherefore to be short, I great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feare that except hereafter there follow a feeling remorse of this foule and vnchristianlike dealing, the wordes of S. Iohn the Euangelist, may be more truly applyed to our Sir Iohn the minister, <hi>Nomen habes, quo viuis, mortuus es. Apoc.</hi> 3.</p>

                  <p>This passage I here make distinct from the former: For although all the precedent deprauations of the first part do potentially include vutruthes and falshoodes: yet our Doctors proteruity therein doth cheifly rest, either in corrupting other mens wordes, or in alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them directly against the knowne intention of the Authors: whereas here, the reduplicatiue formality (as I may terme it) of his hereticall deportment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in plaine lying, to wit, in setting downe and instifying certaine most false assertions, and positions,

a course little sorting to one who styleth him self a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of gods word, in that his sacred word, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incompatible with falshood.</p>
                  <p>The floate of these his vntruthes is so greate, as that our Doctor assordeth vnto vs many scoares of this nature: yet because he would make shew to mantaine diuers of them vnder some pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now here I would haue the iudiceous reader to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue that M. Whyte can not reply in answear hereto, that because there are some other protestantes that do mantaine the said positions with him against his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer learned brethren, that therefore such his positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are freed from all imputation of vntruth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20996:58"/>
him self of lying.</p>
                  <p>This his answeare is most insufficient: First because some of his vntruthes do rest, in affirming that not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Father, or any one protestant, taught such or such a poynt or doctrine: against which generall asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (including all Fathers and prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>stantes) if I can produce but any one Father or protestant (as indeede I can for the most part, produce many) it is enough to conuince him of lying. Secondly in that all Maister W. vntruthes, do make head against the Catholick Faith, and strengthen the protestantes religion (in which respect they may be presumed to be the more wilfull) it can not therefore with any shew of reason be otherwise conceaued, that such learned protestants (for the most part mantaining against the Catholicks the poynt or conclusion of faith, out of which such as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions do ryse, and therefore are not become parties against M. Whyte therein) would euer defend against the Doctor the contrary assertions, much weakning their owne cause thereby, were it not that the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the truth on the Catholick side, doth force them thereunto. And therefore it followeth euen in reason, that the voluntary acknowledgment of any such one learned protestant, ought to ouer balance &amp; weigh downe euen scoares of others not confessing so much: so true is the saying of Irenen; <hi>li.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 14. <hi>Illa est vera &amp; sine contradiction probatio, quae etiam ab aduersariis ipsis, signa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

onely) To conuince this as a most notorious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, I produce not Catholick authorities (for they would seme to the readers eye ouer partiall) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all perfect differences are made vpon vnequall standinges, I insist in dyuers learned protestantes (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyse our professed enemies) who do not beleue our Catholick doctrine herein as true: neuerthelesse do confesse, that such &amp; such Fathers, liuing in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue <hi>Church</hi> (and therefore many ages before the foresaide Councell) did teach the said doctrine of Transubstantiation.

                  <p>First then the most receaued opinion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes touching Antichrist his coming (for they are most various amonge them selues therein) is, that S.

                  <p>But now seeing that by laying contraries together, the one often receaueth much force from the other in the apprehension of our iudgment; let vs a litle enter more perticulerly into the courses of such our ministers as from whom we are to expect the greatest satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this poynte, that so in an euen libration of the matter, the Reader may rest more fully satisfyed, and M.

                  <p>For the discouery of this falshood, we fynd, that the Centuristes do confessse, <note n="w" place="margin">Cen. 3. c. 6.

Our delicate minister as a professed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to all austerity of lyfe, writeth thus against fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. <hi>All antiquity can witnes, that in the primitiue Church, Fasting was held an indifferent thing, &amp; euery man was left to his owne mind therein.</hi> This falshood is made discouerable by these acknowledgmentes following.</p>
                  <p>And first it is so certaine that <hi>AErius</hi> was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Epiphanius, haer.</hi> 76. and by S.

                     <hi>I will not dissemble that which you think the greatest matter: Aerius taught that fasting dayes are not to be obserued.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same condemnation of <hi>Aerius</hi> by the former Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is acknowledged by doctor Whytaker, <note n="b" place="margin">Con.

                  <p>This lye will appeare more euident, if we instance it in the fast of Lent, which fast was so farr from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompted arbitrary, or a thing indifferent, in the primitiue Church, as that Cartwright reproueth S.-Ambrose for saying. <note n="e" place="margin">Cartwright in Whitgiftes defence.</note>

                  <p>Now that these sayinges of the former protestants do, if not actually, immediatly, and primariously, yet at least potentially, and necessarily, include in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, that god is the author of sinne: is graunted by other more modest protestant wryters, who do alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether condemne the foresaid doctrine of Caluin, Zuin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glius, and Beza.</p>

Bernard) whosoeuer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any sort diseased of body, should eate, should be healed of their sicknes: whereupon infinite people eating of the same, were cured most miraculously of all kind of diseases.

                  <p>As concerning the first poynt, I say, that the Church of Rome more then a thousand yeres agoe, haith seaced (supposing that before it was) to be protestant, and therefore her self professing the contrary faith, as then, could not conuert the said Countries to protestancy.</p>
                  <p>That the Church of Rome acknowledged not in these tymes the protestantes religion, is most abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confessed by the protestantes them selues, who do frequently teach that the true Church of God (&amp; consequently in their supposales, their owne Church) haith bene latent and inuisible more then these laste thousand yeres, during all which tyme, the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and popish Religion (as they terme it) haith pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed all Christian Countries whatsoeuer.</p>

                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:20996:83"/>Now that there was no innouation touching the Adoration of the Sacrament at that tyme, is euinced from two reasons. First because no Historiographer doth geue the least intimation of any such institution as then but newly brought into the Church: onely Honorius decreed, that the preist should more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently admonish the people thereof, in reguarde of some former negligence crept in concerning the same: And this is all which can be truly collected from the Decree of the said Honorius.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the former poynt is proued, from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant testimonies of our aduersaries, charging the tymes precedent to Honorius, with the said doctrine of Adoration. For first we reade, that <hi>Auerroes</hi> a hea then Philosopher (who liued aboue 80. yeres before the prescribed time of Honorius his former supposed innouation) did perticulerly deride the Christians of his dayes, for the Adoring of the Sacrament.</p>

                  <p>Now all these authorities, do demonstratiuely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, that the Adoration of the Sacrament, was not introduced in the Church, as an innouation in the time of Honorius.

And here for greater compendiousnes, I will insiste onely in two pointes, first in displaying in part his <hi>Sensuality</hi>: Secondly his <hi>Pryde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And first touching his sayinges of lust and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, he thus admonisheth. <note n="a" place="margin">Sermo de Matrimonio.</note> 
                     <hi>Si non vult vxor, aut non possit, veniat ancilla. If the wyfe will not or can not, let the maid come.</hi> Againe he thus writeth. <note n="b" place="margin">Tom. 5. wittem. ser. de Matrim. fol. 119.</note> 
                     <hi>As it is not in my power that I should be no man: so it is not in my power that I should be without a woman.</hi> And there after. <hi>It is not in our power either that it should be stayed or omitted, but it is as necessary, as that I should be a man, and more necessary then to eat, drink, purge, make cleane the nose &amp;c.</hi> And yet more fully he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of his owne incontinency in these wordes. <note n="c" place="margin">De colloq. mens. fol. 526.</note> 
                     <hi>I am almost mad through the rage of lust and desire of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> As also he thus further confesseth. <note n="d" place="margin">To. 1. Ep. fol. 334. Ep. ad Philippá.</note> 
                     <hi>I am bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the great flame of my vntamed flesh: I who ought to be feruent in spirit, am feruent in the flesh, in lust, slouth, &amp;c. Eight dayes are now past, wherein I neither write, pray, nor study, being uexed partly with temptation of the flesh, partly with other trouble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This point is so euident, that <hi>Benedict Morgenstern</hi> a protestant writer saith of the Caluenistes, when they intend at any tyme to geue assent or prouocation to nature: <hi>Non verentur inter se dicere, hodie Lutheranicè vinemus. They were not afraid to say among them selues, to day we will liue after the manner of Luther.</hi> 
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Tract. de Eccl. p. 221.</note> Thus vsing the name of Luther, the more fully to expresse the libidenous lyfe and custome of Luther.</p>
                  <p>Now to all these confessions of his owne &amp; other protestantes, it can not be replyed that him self did write thus when he was a papist, aud before his reuolt: for of his lyfe during his stay in the papacy, you shall heare his owne report, that <note n="f" place="margin">Vpon the Epistle to the Galathians in engl. in ca. 1. fol. 35.</note>

Which course of writing, whether it may be ascrybed to our Doctors ignorance &amp; want of learning, or rather (which is more probable) to his malice against the Catholick Faith, and desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the simple and vnlearned, or lastly to the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of his cause, being deuoide of better arguments, I leaue to him self to decide. But howsoeuer it is, here I am to aduertise the Reader, that in perusing of such authorities produced by M.

And so he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the wordes of Tertulian, though in a different sense, to the loose writinges of M. Whyte and such others <hi>Quemcun<expan>

                  <p>And here M. Whyte can not say, in excuse of him self, that such testimonies of this nature are produced by him onely to proue so much and no more, as the wordes in their litterall and acknowledged sense, do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly import: Which euasion is insufficient for two respects.</p>
                  <p>First because the proof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of that which litterally &amp; plainely they signify, is not in controuersy betwene
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20996:87"/>
the protestantes and vs, and therefore the iustifiing of so much being not denied by any learned Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, is needelesly vndertaken.</p>
                  <p>Secondly in that M. Whyte doth most labourious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, painefully, and purposly, alledg the said testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to conuince, and impugne, some one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick poynt or other, taught by vs, and denyed by the protestantes, and this his drift and scope is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested, either by his answearable entituling of the leaues wherein such authorities are found, or els by his owne wordes precedent or subsequent to the said sentences.</p>
                  <p>But to detayne the Reader no longer from these his allegations: The first point of this kynde which presenteth it self, is as touching the Rule of Faith, &amp; reiecting of all Apostolicall Traditions: For pag. 13. we thus read, digres. 3. <hi>Wherein by the Scriptures, Fathers, Reasons, and papistes owne confessions, it is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Scripture is the rule of Faith:</hi> As likewise he entituleth that leafe and some others following, in this manner. <hi>The Scripture onely, is tho iudg &amp; rule of Faith.</hi> And so answearably hereto, pag. 17. bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the former tytle, he thus saith. <hi>Shall the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynes be recalled from their blind reuelations, to their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten text: and shall not the papistes be reuoked from their vncertaine Traditions to the same rule?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that we may the better behould how valiantly our minister impugneth all Traditions, by erectinge the Scripture as sole rule of Faith: we are here to call vnto mind what the Catholick Church teacheth in this poynt.</p>
                  <p>It then teacheth, that the word of God is to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and confine our Faith, and that nothing is to be accompted as matter of faith, which receaueth not it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:20996:88"/>
proofe from thence. Hereupon it teacheth further, that this word is either writen, which is commonly called the Scripture, or els deliuered by Christ &amp; his Church, and this comprehendeth Traditions. Both these we beleue to be of infallible authority, since the true and inward reason why the word of God is the word of God, is not because it is writen, rather then deliuered by speach, (for this is merely extrinsicall to the point) but because the said word proceded from them, who were infallibly and immediatly directed therein by the assistance of the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>This supposed, let vs see how M. Whyte proueth that the writen word is onely the rule of Faith, and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly that there are no Traditions of the Church which may also in part be a rule thereof,</p>
                  <p>First then our Doctor vrgeth to this end seuerall places of Scripture, as (among others) that of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. <note n="a" place="margin">prou. 2. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>The scripture will make a man vnderstand righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, and iudgment, and equity, &amp; euery good path.</hi> Againe that of Esay. <note n="b" place="margin">Esa. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>We must repaire to the Law, to the testimony: if any speake not according to that word, there is no light in him.</hi> Also out of Malachy. <note n="c" place="margin">Malach. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Remember the Law of Moyses my seruant, which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him in Horeb for all Israell, with the statutes &amp; Iudgmentes.</hi> In lyke sort he alledgeth, that Abraham answearing the rich glutton, said, that <note n="d" place="margin">Luc. 16.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now that the Reader may see, how well these texts are to the point controuerted, I will set some of them downe in forme of Argument, and so apply them to M. Whytes purpose. As first thus. Salomon said of the Scriptures of the old Testament. <hi>The Scripture will make a man vnderstand righteousnes, and Iudgment, and equity, and euery good path: Ergo now in the tyme of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20996:88"/>
Christianity, there are no Traditions, but the Scripture of the old Testament, it the onely rule of Faith.</hi> Againe, <hi>Remember the Law of Moyses my seruant, which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him in Horeb, for all Israell, with the statutes &amp; iudgments; Therefore no Traditions.</hi> Lastly. <hi>The bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the rich glutton had Moyses and the Prophets: Therefore no pointes of Christian Faith, are to be proued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any Traditions of the Church.</hi> Strangly, wildly, &amp; most exorbitantly concluded: for what reference haue these textes with the rule of Faith, the which is not so much as glaunced at in any one of them? or graunting that they had, why should the old Testament, be a paterne for the Faith professed in the new Testament, since all Christians do graunt, that the time of Grace, is enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with many priuiledges and immunities, whereof the old Law was altogether depriued?</p>
                  <p>After these and such like textes of Scripture, he des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth, to proue the soresaid point, from the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the auncient Fathers: as, to omitt diuers others, he alledgeth Tertulian saying. <note n="e" place="margin">cont.

                     <hi>The Scripture is the rule of Faith,</hi> which we graunt, for we teach that it is <hi>Regula partialis fidei,</hi> a Rule of our faith in part, yet hence it followeth not (which is the point here onely to be proued) that it is <hi>Regula totalis,</hi> an entyre &amp; sole rule of Faith, without the help of any Traditions, and as large in extent as our faith is.</p>
                  <p>Also S. Augustine thus wryting <note n="f" place="margin">De nupr. &amp; concup. ad Valer. l. 2. ca. 33.</note>

Againe Gregory Nyssen tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Scripture, <note n="g" place="margin">Orat. de iis qui adeunt Hietos.</note> a <hi>strait and inflexible Rule,</hi> as in that the Scriptute is inflexible and inchangeable for those pointes which it proueth, therefore it alone and no Apostolicall traditions, is to proue any article of our Faith.

to be an authour what to allow, or what to disalow in the exposition of any text, for they rely herein vpon the iudgment of Gods vniuersall Church, the former being indeede rather peculiar to the sectaries of this age, in reguard of their priuate interpreting spirit. And presently after, he also cyteth S. Augustine againe in the former booke. <hi>Why dost thou not rather submits thy self to Euangelicall Authority, so steedfast, so stable, so renowned, and by certaine succession commended from the Apostles to our tymes: that thou maist beleue, that thou maist behould, that thou maist learne, all those thinges which hinder thee from doing it through thine owne vaine &amp; peruerse opinion.</hi> How can these wordes be tentred &amp; shamed to vs Catholickes?

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we see how wandringly M.

And after the like manner euen in the first leafe here alledged, though somwhat before these last testimonies, he vrgeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine textes of Scripture intended of Christ, as <note n="15" place="margin">Io. 20.</note>

derogate any thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Churches Authority, since indeede they do not concerne it, neither do they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe any more to Christ, then all Catholickes doe acknowledg and beleue.

                  <p>Next to the former testimonies, he marshalleth <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory De Valentia</hi> thus writing. <note n="6" place="margin">Anal. fid. l. 6. ca. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>When we say, the Church is alwaies conspicuous, this must not be taken, as if we thought it might at euery season be discerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like easily. For we know that it is som-times tossed with the waues of erroures, schismes, and persecutions, that to such as are vnskilfull, and do not discreetly euough weygh the circumstances of tymes and thinges, it shall be very hard to be knowne &amp;c. Therefore we deny not, but that it will be harder to discerne the Church at some tymes, then at other some: yet this we auouch, that it alwaies migt be discerned, by such as could wisly esteeme thinges.</hi> Thus this Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Author wirh whom D. Stapleton is alledged <note n="7" place="margin">Relect. contr. 1. q. 3. p. 30.</note> by M. Whyte, to conspire herein. Now what doth this testimony make against vs, since it chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that the splendour of Gods Church, is more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant and shyning, at one tyme, then at an other (which we willingly graunt) but it is impertinently vrged to proue that it should be absolutly eclipsed, (the point that ought to be euicted) nay it clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth the contrary. For first the former wordes say that the <hi>Church is alwaies conspicuous.</hi> Secondly, that the Church is alwaies discerned by those who wysely esteeme of thinges, therefore to such it is alwaies vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: And thus doth M. Whytes owne testimony, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyle with great force vpon him self.</p>
                  <p>After our Doctor haith ended with Catholick mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne wrvters, he beginneth to proue the inuisibility of the Church, from the authority of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:20996:94"/>
and among others (whom for breuity I preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) he alledgeth S. Chrisostome, and vshereth his authority with this preface. <hi>And that Chrisostome thought, the Church might be somtimes inuisible, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the 49. homily vpon Mathew where he saith. Since the tyme that heresy haith inuaded the Church: it can no way be knowne which is the true Church of Christ, but by the Scriptures onely, in this confusion, it can no wayes els be knowne.</hi> From which wordes, I do collect a continuall visiblenes of the Church: for if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be euer able to make the Church knowne, then by them it is euer made visible, and consequently, (since the scriptures haue euer hitherto bene preserued, and through Gods good prouidence no doubt shall be euen to the end of the world) the Church haith bene, and shall be at all times made knowne and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible through the meanes of the Scripture. And thus disputing onely <hi>ad hominem,</hi> do I turne the point of M. Whytes reason vpon himself.</p>
                  <p>And this may suffice touching M. Whytes weake prouing of the latency of Christes Church: where the Reader may behould a longe teame (as it were) of his lame, feeble, and impotent authorities, one still fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing an other, taken from the writinges of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctors and the Fathers, whereof some do neither fortify, nor hurt his cause, and others do proue euen contrary to that, for which he alledgeth them. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of which his dull, grosse, and absurd kind of reasoning and arguing, if it be true in Philosophy, that the vnderstanding doth work better, or worse, as the spirits are more or lesse pure, and that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are become more or lesse pure, according to the quality of the nutriment that the body taketh: I must then conclude, that when M. Whyte penned this his

                  <p>M.

                  </p>
                  <p>In proofe hereof, he produceth diuers passages of Scripture, where our Sauiour said, <note n="7" place="margin">Io. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>My sheepe here my voice.</hi> And againe. <note n="8" place="margin">Mat. 18.</note>

                     <hi>You shall know the false prophets by their frutes.</hi> And finally that saying of S. Paule, <note n="10" place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>As many as walk, according to this rule</hi> (meaning according to the rule of a true Faith) <hi>peace vpon them, and mercy, and vpon the Israell of God.</hi> Againe those wordes of the Apostle touching the Church. <note n="11" place="margin">Ephe. 2.</note> that <hi>It is the howshold of God, built vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> As also where it is said, that the Scripture <hi>is a</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now what Alcumist in the world can abstract out of any of these textes, that sense or meaning which shall prooue, that true doctrine is a sufficient mark to vs, whereby we may infallibly discerne, which is the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:20996:95"/>
true Church of God? He may as easely draw fyre out of water, or earth out of ayre, betwene which, there are no symbolizing qualities. For let vs see how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably we can inferre, what is intended out of the said Scriptures: as thus. <hi>Christ saith, My shepe here my voice: Therefore true doctrine is to vs a signe of the true Church.</hi> Againe, <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middest of them: Therfore we are to learne the true Church from the true doctrine.</hi> Strangely inferred: for how shall we know (euer abstracting the Authority of the Church) who are Christes sheepe? or who are they which are gathered together in his name? If it be replyed, they are those who haue true doctrine: then I demaund, how can we be assured who haue true doctrine? If it be answeared, they haue true doctrine, who heare the word truly preached, &amp; enioy a perfect ministration of the Sacraments: then I aske, how shall I be acertained, that such do heare the word truly preached, and enioy a perfect ministration of the Sacramentes? But here my answear is at a stand, and flieth for sanctuary, to his Apocalypticall and reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling spirit. Thus it is cleare in what circles &amp; mazes M. Whyte, or any other walketh, through the vaine suggestions and imaginations, of a light, vaperous, &amp; giddy braine.</p>
                  <p>The like connexion with the former conclusion, haue the other places of Scripture aboue cyted: The which after he haith set downe, then page 107. he descendeth to the Authorities of Fathers, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authors, labouring (though most weakly) to hayle from their wordes, his former Illation. To this end he bringeth in S. Epiphanius saying of an heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike <note n="12" place="margin">li. 2. haer. ca. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>This man is found altogether different from the holy Scriptures &amp;c. If then he be dissenting from them, he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20996:96"/>
is altogether an alyen from the holy Catholick Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we graunt, that in the true nature of faith, who dissenteth from the Scriptures, dissenteth from the Church, but yet this proueth not, that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of faith, or administration of the Sacramentes, may serue to vs, as markes, to demonstrate out the Church. Againe he produceth M. Raynouldes affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that 13 <hi>The true Church, and the true faith, are so knitt together, that the one inferreth and concludeth the other, for from the true Church, is concluded the true faith, and from the true faith, the true Church.</hi> All this is true, yet it followeth not from hence, that <hi>faith is more knowne to vs then the Church,</hi> and couseqnently that it ought to serue to vs, as a cleare and euident mark, to point out aswell to the vnlearned, as learned, which is the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Adde hereto, that these wordes euen in M. Whytes sense, asmuch impugne him as vs: for if they imply faith to be a marke of the Church: they also reciprocally imply the Church to be a marke of the true Faith.</p>
                  <p>Finally, to omitte many other testimonies of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes produced to the lyke end (whose particuler answeares do ryse from the circumstances of the places, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now who can inferr out of these wordes, that the Scripture is knowne to vs before the Church, seeing indeede the priority of the one or the other, is not so

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:20996:97"/>
of her from whose chast loynes euen him self is (at least originally) descended. But that we may better see how little conducing his testimonies alledged are to the purpose: let vs first set downe what the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes do freely graunt &amp; teach in this point.</p>
                  <p>They ioyntly teach, that the bound of subiecting ones self to the Churches Authority, is properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent vpon Christians, who are made members of the Church by baptisme, and consequently do owe their obedience thereunto, and not vpon infidels or Iewes, who are not obliged to embrace Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, except they see it confirmed by miracles, or some other enforcing reasons of credibility: Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, though an heritike do sinne, in doubting of the Churches Authority, yet supposing that his doubt and sinne, he doth not euill to examine the doctrine of the Church, according to the Scriptures, if so be he procedeth herein, onely with a desyre of fynding the truth.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs see what Authorities M. Whyte alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to proue his former positions. First he vrgeth those wordes of the Apostle, <note n="a" place="margin">1. Thes. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Try all thinges, &amp; hould that which is good.</hi> As also those of our Sau. <note n="b" place="margin">Io. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>If any man will do the will of God, he shall know of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, whether it be of God, or whether I speake of my self.</hi> And againe that of S. Iohn. <note n="c" place="margin">1. Io. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Derely beloued beleue not euery spirit, but try the spirits whether they be of God.</hi> In like sort those wordes of Christ. <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Beware of false prophets, by their frutes you shall know them.</hi> And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (besides the example of the men of Beraea search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures,<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 17.</note>) he vrgeth that where the Apostle counseleth the Hebrewes, that <note n="f" place="margin">Hebr. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Through longe custome, they should haue their wittes exercised both to discerne good and euill.</hi> But for greater perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:20996:97"/>
let vs shape one or two of these textes, to the true point here of the question. Thus then. <hi>Try all thinges, and hould what is good: therefore euery priuate man may vndertake to censure the whole Church of God.</hi> Which wordes indeede do not presse the doubt, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both those wordes, and that place of S. Iohn, c. 4. are directed properly to such onely, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to trye and examine, both doctrine, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to wit, not to euery particuler member of the Church, but onely to the Bishops and Pastors thereof, who are <note n="a" place="margin">Ezech. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>Speculatores domus Israel.</hi> Againe if by this text euery priuate man, may trye, reiect, or allow, all thinges at his pleasure: then may he reiect or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (as him self thinketh good) the holy Scriptures: for in the former wordes of the Apostle there is no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation at all. But to procede to an other text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beware of false prophets, by their frutes you shall knowe them: therefore euery priuate man is to examine the doctrine of all the Prophets and Pastors of the Church assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a lawfull generall Councell.</hi> Againe the men of Berea (who were no Christians) were allowed to trye the doctrine of S. Paule: therefore euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian (who by force of his second birth or regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is made a member and sonne of the Church) may examine, controule, and reiect, the publick faith of the said Church.</p>
                  <p>Doctor-lyke inferred, as if there were no disparity herein, betwene him who is not a Christian (&amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently acknowledgeth not any submission or reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to gods Church) and an other who is a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and therefore in his baptisme doth implicitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe him self, and his Iudgment, to the Authority of the Church.</p>
                  <p>With the lyke want of connection or true refere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20996:98"/>
M. Whyte presseth to the same purpose, the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of certaine auncient Fathers, whose drift in such their writinges, was to wish men to examine by the Scriptures, the doctrine of priuate and particuler men, lest, as the Apostle saith, <hi>Circumferantur omni vento doctrinae.</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> all which he will needes extend, to the discussing of the doctrine of the whole Church. And thus particulerly he alledgeth that saying of S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome. <note n="c" place="margin">Chrisost. in Act. ho. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>Seeing we take the Scriptures which are so true and plaine, it will be an easy matter for you to iudge. And tell me, hast thou any wit or iudgment? For it is not a mannes part, barely to receaue whatsoeuer he heareth. Say not, I am no scholler, and can be no Iudg, I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne no opinion, for this is but a shift &amp;c.</hi> The scope onely of which place, is (as is said) to refute the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of euery new sectary euen from the Scriptures, a course which we willingly admit and allow.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see how our minister is not ashamed to peruert and detort, the graue Authotitie of this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Father.</p>
                  <p>But here the Reader is to vnderstand, that M.

For the more facilitating whereof, he masketh this his intent, vnder the shadow of ascribing all reuerence and honour to the Scriptures, both for their sufficiency, as contayning expresly all thinges necessary to saluation, as also for their abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Soueraignty and Prerogatiue, in determininge inappealeably, all controuersies of faith and religion whatsoeuer.

altogether insisteth in such vnnecessary and immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all stuffe) endeuoreth most calumniously to bleare the iudgmentes of the ignorant, they not being able at the first sight, to perceaue the very tuch of any doubt or question betwene the protestants and vs. Many autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rities of Catholickes he produceth to this ende, the sense and meaning of which, he most strangely peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from the true intention of the writer, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue their full satisfaction, from the circumstances of the place.</p>
                  <p>But now here I am (according to my former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed methode) to display the weaknes of such te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, which being acknowledged in their true &amp; natiue sense and construction, do nothing at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Catholick doctrine against which they are vrged, and consequently do not conuince any wante of vnity in doctrine amonge the Catholickes.

                     <hi>The prayers which men vnderstand not, want the frute which they should reape if they vnderstoode them: for they might both specially intend their myndes to god, for the obtayning euen in speciall of that, which with their mouthes they beg: and also through their pyous sense of their praier then vttered, they should be more edefyed.

                  <p>Now here M.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20996:99"/>
the other haue certaine peculier helpes and aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to it self: But what is this to the lawfulnes or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnes of praying in a strange tongue? or what kind of logick is this: <hi>Prayer for some particuler reasons, is better in a vulgar tongue then in a strang tongue: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is absolutely vnlawfull in a strange tongue?</hi> In lyke sort, touching latin seruice, he bringeth in <hi>S.</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas of Aquine, &amp; Caietaine, affirming that it were better for the <hi>edification of the Church, if such Prayer were in a vulgar tongue.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet here is to be noted, that true Contrition (which is a repenting for our sinnes in the highest degree, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the loue of God) can not be without Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, at least <hi>in voto,</hi> and desire, seing he can not be truly and perfectly penitent, who neglecteth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes (if opportunity serue for the obtay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning of them) appointed by God for the expiation of sinne.

                  <p>In like sort touching Iustification by workes, which (according to our Catholick doctrine) are to be done in state of grace, and not by force of nature, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue their worth, not from the worker, but both from the promise of God, as also from the passion of our Sauiour, (in the blood whereof they receaue a new tincture) the Doctor idly introduceth S.

Wherefore M. W. can not dispute thus from the Cardinals wordes. <hi>In reguard of the vncertainty of our owne righteousnes, and because of the daunger of vaine glory, the saifest way is to put our sole confidence in the sole mercy of God: Therefore workes in generall do not merite, or therefore workes done in true humility, and proceding from one that is righteous, donot merite.</hi> For the doubt here which Bellarmine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth, resteth not in the doctrine of merite, but in the vncertainty of our doing of them, to wit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y are performed by vs in that state, and with all those due circumstances, as are requisite for them that they may merite. But it seemeth that M. W. can not fall vpon any obscure sentences of Catholicks, but instantly he striueth to turne them as if they were the sayinges of his owne brethren, like the fyre which coueteth to conuert euery thing it toucheth into it self.</p>
                  <p>This done M. Whyte page 159. descendeth to shew the different opinions of Catholickes touching some pointes of the reall presence, as first whether (after the bread and wyne being changed by the words of Consecration into the body and bloud of Christ)
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20996:101"/>
the accidences do remaine without a subiect, or that they haue their inherence in the quantity, or that the body of Christ sustaineth them, or the lyke.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how the accidents remaining after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, haue power to nourish, to wit, whether the thing nourished therewith, procede from the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, or that the substance of bread and wyne retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againe, and so it causeth the nutrition, or that the accidences by Gods power, are changed into the thing nourished, or some such lyke manner.</p>
                  <p>Thus our minister goeth on discoursing very sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how it appeareth from these and the like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that the <hi>papistes agree not in their doctrine</hi>; and further thus saith. <hi>You may see by these few examples, how the papistes are deuided about the principall articles of their faith &amp;c.</hi> But here the iudiceous Reader may see, that touching the fust sort of Catholick testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies aboue explayned, we finde no difference of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all, betwene the Catholickes by him alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and other Catholickes. And as concerning their seuerall opinions about those secondary questions of the blessed Sacrament, they are onely pointes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, and do not at all imply any disunion in matter of faith. For touching the B. Sacrament, that which is principally an Article of our faith is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bread and wyne, be really, and truly changed by the wordes of consecration, into the Body and bloud of Christ, the which all Catholickes whatsoeuer do iointly and constantly beleue. And as concerning those other doubtes resulting out of the former confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Article. and vrged here by M. Whyte, they are onely indifferences, and philosophicall questions dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in the schooles, and by seuerall men, seuerally mantained, without any breach of faith. But here I should make bould (on the contrary part) to put M.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:20996:101"/>
M. Whyte in mynd touching the diuision in doctrine among the protestantes (a point heretofore touched in this Treatise) that they are such, euen by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of them selues, as do wound the soundnes of Christian faith: I think the displaying thereof would be litle pleasing vnto him, gratefull to his cause. But for this present I will forbeare, and will onely adde hereto (for the greater disaduantage of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, that when a Catholick obstinatly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaceously, mantaineth any heresy (for such accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Church) he, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> deuideth him self from the Church, and so seaceth to be a member there of, as seuerall tymes we graunt it hapneth: But the case is otherwise among the protestants. For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it each of them doth defend his seuerall opinions in the weightiest pointes of faith: yet they neuerthelesse accompt one an other, as members of one and the same Church, as we see by experience it faleth out, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwene the Lutherans and the Caluenistes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so betwene our English protestantes, and the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, who (notwithstanding the great disparity of faith and doctrine amonge them) do in their owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, make vp one and the same protestants Church: and do still repute each other, as faithfull brethren of the said Church, and zealous professoures of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
                  <p>Here now I will close vp this third and last part of this small Treatise, wherein I trust I haue discouered M. Whytes disioynted and loose kynd of writing, all which his reasoninges and authorities (seruing onely as a taist to the Reader, what more he may expect in this kind, if the ministers whole booke should be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially perused) are taken out (deuiding his booke into three partes) onely of the first part, and fewer

               <p>And now seeing here I haue vntwisted the cheife threedes whereupon the whole loome of his Treatise is wouen: I doubt not but out of your owne cleare-eyd Iudgmentes, you will immediatly looke vpon the same, as it is in it self fraughted with such vnworthy stuffe, and not as it haith receaued light and grace from the weake opinion of the ignorant, and seduced multitude: which I rather expect peculiarly at your handes, since your selnes know, that in a true vew of any thing, <hi>refracted beames</hi> neuer afford a perfecte sight. And thus to your owne censure and chastis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I remitt M.

seest what scarres do remaine vpon the face of this our ministers reputation, him self first playing the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter, then a lyer, and then a tryfling writer.
