            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ACCOUNT
Of what passed at the
EXECUTION
Of the Late
Duke of Monmouth,
On Wednesday <date>the 15th of July, 1685.</date> on Tower-Hill.
TOGETHER
With a Paper Signed by Himself that morning in the Tower,
in the Presence of the Lords Bishops of Ely, and Bath and
Wells, Dr. Tenison, and Dr. Hooper.
AND ALSO,
The Copy of His Letter to His MAJESTY after he was taken,
Dated at Ringwood in Hantshire, <date>the 8th of July.</date>
            </head>
            <p>THe <hi>late Duke of Monmouth</hi> came from the Tower to the Scaffold, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the <hi>Bishop of</hi> Ely, <hi>the Bishop of</hi> Bath <hi>and</hi> Wells, <hi>Dr.</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison
<hi>and Dr.</hi> Hooper, which four the King was graciously pleased to send
him, as his Assistants to prepare him for Death; and the <hi>late Duke</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
intreated all four of them, to accompany him to the Place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to continue with him to the last. The two Bishops going in
the Lieutenant's Coach with him to the Barrs, made seasonable and devout Applications
to him all the way; and one of them desired him not to be surprized, if they to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
last upon the Scaffold, renewed those Exhortations to a <hi>Particular Repentance,</hi> which
they had so often repeated before.</p>
            <p>At his first coming upon the Scaffold, he looked for the Executioner, and seeing him,
said, <hi>Is this the man to do the business? Do your work well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> began to speak, some one or other of the Assistants
during the whole time, applying themselves to him.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Monmouth.</speaker>
               <p>I shall say but very little; I come to die; I die a Protestant of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Assistants.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, if you be of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> you must acknowledge the
Doctrine of <hi>Non-resistance</hi> to be True.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If I acknowledge the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in general, that includes all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, it is fit to own <hi>that</hi> Doctrine particularly, with respect to your Case. Here he
was much urged about that Doctrine of <hi>Non-resistance,</hi> but he repeated in effect his first
Answer.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then he began as if he was about to make a premeditated Speech, in this manner.</p>
            <sp>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60707:2"/>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I have had a Scandal raised upon me about a Woman, a Lady of Vertue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
I will name her; <hi>the Lady Henrietta Wentworth.</hi> I declare, That she is a very Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Godly Woman. I have committed no Sin with her; and that which hath passed
betwixt Vs, was very Honest and Innocent in the sight of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>In your Opinion perhaps, Sir, as you have been often told; <hi>(i. e.</hi> in the Tower)
but this is not fit Discourse in this Place.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sher. Gostlin.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, were you ever married to her?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>This is not a Time to Answer that Question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sher. Gostlin.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I hoped to have heard of your Repentance for the Treason and
Bloodshed, which hath been committed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I dy very Penitent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, It is fit to be <hi>Particular;</hi> and considering the <hi>Publick</hi> Evil you have done,
you ought to do as much good now, as possibly you can, by a <hi>Publick</hi> acknowledgment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>What I have thought fit to say of <hi>Publick</hi> Affairs, is in a Paper which I have
signed; I refer to my Paper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, there is nothing in that Paper about <hi>Resistance,</hi> and you ought to be <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
in your Repentance, and to have it well grounded. God give you <hi>True</hi> Repentance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I dy very Penitent, and dy with great Chearfulness, for I know I shall go to God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, you must go to God in his own way: Sir, be sure you be truely Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
and ask forgiveness of God, for the Many you have wronged.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I am sorry for every one I have wronged, I forgive every Body, I have had many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
I forgive them all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, your acknowledgment ought to be <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Particular.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I am to die; pray, My Lord—I refer to my Paper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They are but a few Words that we desire: We onely desire an Answer to this Point.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I can bless God that he hath given me so much Grace, that for these two years last
past, I have led a Life unlike to my former Course, and in which I have been happy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, Was there no Ill in these two Years? In these years, these great Evils have
happened, and the giving <hi>publick</hi> Satisfaction is a necessary part of Repentance; be pleased
to own a Detestation of your REBELLION.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>

                  </gap> will stick to my Paper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, as I said before, there is nothing in your Paper, about the Doctrine
of <hi>Non-resistance.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I repent of all things that a true Christian ought to repent of. I am to die; pray,
My Lord—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Then (My Lord) we can only recommend you to the Mercy of God, but
we cannot pray with that Chearfulness, and Encouragement as we should, if you had
made a <hi>Particular</hi> Acknowledgment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>God be praised, I have Encouragement enough in my self; I die with a clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
I have wronged no man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>How Sir, no man? Have you not been guilty of <hi>Invasion,</hi> and of much <hi>Blood,</hi>
which has been shed, and it may be of the loss of <hi>many Souls</hi> who followed you? You
must needs have wronged a great many.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I do, Sir, own that, and am sorry for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Give it the <hi>true</hi> name, Sir, and call it <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>What name you please, Sir, I am sorry for <hi>invading</hi> the Kingdom, and for the <hi>Blood</hi>
that has been shed, and for the <hi>Souls</hi> which may have been lost by my means, I am sorry
it ever happened [which he spake softly.]</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sher. Vandeput.</speaker>
               <p>[To some that stood at a distance.] He says he is very sorry for
<hi>invading the Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>We have nothing to add, but to renew the frequent Exhortations we have made
to you, to give some Satisfaction for the <hi>publick</hi> Injuries to the Kingdom. There have been
a great many lives lost by this <hi>Resistance</hi> of your LAWFUL PRINCE.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>What I have done has been very ill, and I wish with all my heart it had never been;
I never was a man that delighted in Blood; I was very far from it; I was as cautious in that
as any man was; the Almighty knows how I now die, with all the Joyfulness in the World.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>God grant you may, Sir; God give you <hi>True Repentance.</hi>

               <p>If I had not <hi>True</hi> Repentance, I should not so easily have been without the fear
of dying. I shall die like a Lamb.</p>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I do not attribute it to my own. Nature, for I am fearful as other men are; but
I have now no fear, as you may see by my Face, but there is something within me which does
it, for I am sure I shall go to God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, be sure upon good Grounds; Do you repent you of all your Sins, <hi>known</hi> or
<hi>unknown, confessed</hi> or <hi>not confessed,</hi> of all the Sins which might proceed from <hi>Error in
Judgment?</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>God Almighty of his infinite Mercy forgive you. Here are great numbers of
Spectators, here are <hi>the Sheriffs,</hi> they represent the <hi>Great City,</hi> and in speaking to them,
you speak to the whole City; make some Satisfaction by owning your <hi>Crime</hi> before them.</p>
            </sp>
            <stage>He was silent here</stage>
            <p>Then all went to solemn Commendatory Prayers, which continued for a good space,
the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and the Company kneeling, and joyning in them with great
fervency.</p>
            <p>Prayers being ended, before he and the four who assisted him, were risen from their
Knees, he was again earnestly exhorted to a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>thorough</hi> Repentance.</p>
            <p>After they were risen up, he was exhorted to pray for the King; and was asked, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he did not desire to send some dutiful Message to <hi>His Majesty,</hi> and to recommend
<hi>his Wife and Children</hi> to his Majesty's Favour.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>What harm have they done? do it if you please; I pray for him, and for all men.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Then the Versicles were repeated.</p>

               <p>Sir, do you not pray for <hi>the King</hi> with us? (The Versicle was again repeated.)</p>
               <p>O Lord save the King.</p>

               <p>Then he spake to the Executioner concerning his <hi>undressing, &amp;c.</hi> and he would have no
<hi>Cap, &amp;c.</hi> and at the beginning of his <hi>undressing</hi> it was said to him on this manner;</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, you have been bred a <hi>Souldier,</hi> you will do a generous Christian thing, if
you please to go to the Rail, and speak to the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and say, That here you stand a
sad example of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and entreat <hi>them</hi> and <hi>the People</hi> to be <hi>Loyal,</hi> and <hi>Obedient to
the King.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I have said I will make no Speeches; I will make no Speeches; I come to die.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, ten words will be enough.</p>
               <p>Then calling his Servant, and giving him something like a Tooth-pick-Case; <hi>here</hi> (said
he) <hi>give this to the Person, to whom you are to deliver the other things.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>(To the Executioner.)</hi> Here are six Guinneys for you; Pray do your Business well;
don't serve me as you did my Lord <hi>Russel;</hi> I have heard you struck him three or four times.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>(to his Servant)</hi> take these remaining Guinneys and give them to him, if he does
his Work well.</p>

               <p>If you strike me twice, I cannot promise you not to stir.</p>
               <p>During his <hi>undressing</hi> and <hi>standing</hi> towards the <hi>Block</hi> there were used by those who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
him, divers Ejaculations proper at that time, and much of <hi>51st. Psalm</hi> was repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and particularly, <hi>Deliver me from Blood Guiltiness, O God, Thou God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then he lay down, and soon after he raised himself upon his Elbow, and said to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner,
<hi>Prethee let me feel the Ax;</hi> he felt the <hi>Edge,</hi> and said, <hi>I fear it is not sharp
enough.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Executioner.</speaker>
               <p>It is sharp enough, and heavy enough.</p>
               <p>Then he lay down again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>During this space many pious Ejaculations were used by those that assisted him with
great fervency. Ex. Gr.</hi> God accept your Repentance, God accept your Repentance, God accept
your IMPERFECT Repentance; <hi>My Lord,</hi> God accept your GENERAL Repentance; God
Almighty shew his OMNIPOTENT Mercy upon you; Father into thy Hands we commend
his Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lord Jesus, receive his Soul.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur Majesty may think, it is the Misfortune I now ly under, makes me make this
Application to You; but I do assure your Majesty, it is the Remorse I now have
in me, of the Wrong I have done You in several things, and now, in taking up
Arms against You. For my taking up Arms, it never was in my Thoughts since
the King died. The Prince and Princess of <hi>Orange</hi> will be Witness for me, of the Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
I gave them, That I would never stir against You; but my Misfortune was such, as
to meet with some Horrid People, that made me believe things of your Majesty, and
gave me so many false Arguments, that I was fully led away, to believe, That it was a
Shame and a Sin before God not to do it. But, Sir, I will not trouble your Majesty at
present with many things I could say for my self, that I am sure would move your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
the chief end of this Letter being only to beg of You, That I may have that
Happiness, as to speak to your Majesty: For I have that to say to You, Sir, that I hope
may give You a long and happy Reign. I am sure, Sir, when You hear me, You will be
convinced of the Zeal I have for your Preservation, and how heartily I repent of what I
have done. I can say no more to your Majesty now, being this Letter must be seen by
those that keep me. Therefore, Sir, I shall make an end, in begging of your Majesty to
belie<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e so well of me, That I would rather dy a thousand Deaths, than excuse any thing
I have done, if I did not really think my self the most in the wrong, that ever any Man
was, and had not from the bottom of my Heart an abhorrence for those that put me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and for the Action it self. I hope, Sir, God Almighty will strike your Heart with
Mercy and Compassion for me, as he has done mine with the abhorrence of what I have
done. Therefore I hope, Sir, I may live to show You how Zealous I shall ever be for your
Service; and could I say but one Word in this Letter, You would be convinced of it; but
it is of that consequence, That I dare not do it. Therefore, Sir, I do beg of You once
more to let me speak to You, for then You will be convinced how much I shall ever be,
Your Majesties most Humble and Dutiful</p>
