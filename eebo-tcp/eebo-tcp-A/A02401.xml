            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Boute a fortnight ſince, it was my hap to vnderſtande</hi> of a Ballet (as I take it) then newly come from the Preſſe, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a brief and doleful Diſcourſe of the late burning of Eaſt DER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM. And (as for mine owne part) I both was and am a witnes of the wonderful euents therof: and therwithall (what for my conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall trauell of body and mind, the ruines of my friendes &amp; allies and mine owne ſmal loſſes) a fellow feeler of the heauy burthen impoſed vpon the townes eſtate: euen ſo, with ſo much the more good will I entertey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned the newes, expecting ſome better ſequell, and reſted not, til mine eyes were teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the trueth. But when I peruſed the ſame, and approued the penning as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in that or ſuch like caſes, I was (neuertheleſſe) well aduiſed of ſundrie vntruethes, whiche the Author (no doubt) not ſo much vppon pretenced deprauation, as for want of neceſſarie inſtruction had inſerted. And allbeit, no important thing hath therin eſcaped, which (for mine owne part) I would not tollerate, of verie good wil in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: yet ſithe her Maieſtie, her honorable counſaile, many noble, worſhipful, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſonages, bee otherwiſe infourmed of the matter: as alſo, the duetie of a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, requiring by all meanes to intercept the courſe of an vntrueth: and laſt of all, in diuerſities of wandring reportes to eſtabliſh ſome certaintie, I haue vndertaken in the diſcourſe of the matter, to ſet downe ſuch an aſſurance of his particuler errours, and in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead therof, interpoſed ſuch trueth, as the diligent obſeruation of mine owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and the triall of many ſound iudgements can confirme and teſtifie.</p>
            <p>¶One poinct (therfore) wherin he failed, is touching the nomber of Tenementes, Meſſuages, or manſion houſes ſubuerted and ſpoyled.</p>
            <p>The .2. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the diſſolution of our houſes neceſſarie for diuers domeſtical vſes.</p>
            <p>¶The .3. his inſinuation of a totall loſſe and detriment ſuſteined.</p>
            <p>In theſe three (ſpeciallie) hath he left the matter deſtitute of true report: for, as I haue expreſſed in the ſequell of my treatiſe: the nomber of tenementes is. LII. whiche he calleth. LX. The houſes of office, 350. or there aboutes: which hee reducethe into the nomber of .80. The value of all together .8000. li. or very litle leſſe, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth to be .14000. The two firſt (without al controuerſie) are miſtaken, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſhed falſelie: But as for the laſt, I muſt confeſſe, that (at a bluſh) it ſeemeth to carrie great appearance of truth: and I my ſelfe was therin greatly ouerſeene &amp; deceiued, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till with certaine other (of good experience) I had made an eſtimate of euerye parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer loſſe, and brought them to a generall and groſſe ſumme.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, if we may recken the charge, which the towne (if euer ſhe be repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) wil exact, to make returne of her former eſtate, I meane in nomber and quantitie of houſes, and (therwith) not pretermit her manifold loſſes, namely, of coyne, corne, implements of Houſhold ſtuffe, victuales, wood, Timber, chattell, fruict, wels, pumps, hay, ſtraw, time and trades, wherby euer ſince they haue declined and gone backward, which with the reſt are and ought to be brought into the rekning: It is certaine true, that of, 14000 .li. a ſmall remnant wyll remaine, if any deale be left at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6231:3"/>But this is an other caſe: for an accompt is rather to be raiſed accordinge to the rate of ſo much money as euery mans houſe and ſtuffe would yeald in ſale, if now it weare in STATV QVO PRIVS. For albeit the buildinges were ſuch as might haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many yeares and ages, if it had pleaſed the Lorde to permitte them to poſteryties: yet of a newe houſe, in quantitie of proportionable reſemblance with an old, and of an old, is not one and the ſelfe ſame reaſon: becauſe by how mvch it excedeth in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, by ſo much ought it to be preferred in price and eſtimation.</p>
            <p>So then the whole loſſe which towne hath ſuſteyned is 8000 .li. or there abouts, &amp; the reedifiyng or reſtauratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame in neceſſary maner with ſuch other reconings adhearent as I haue allready caſt ouer, will amount to litle leſſe then 14000. and ſo it ſeemeth not vainely ſaide.</p>
            <q>
               <l>He that buyeth a houſe ready wrought,</l>
               <l>Getteth many a nayle fot nought.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thus much Sir, touching the cauſe that moued me to intermedle &amp; buſie my ſelfe about the affayres of this proceſſe.</p>
            <p>Now whereas the Lord of his owne eſpeciall grace from amongeſt the reſt of that part of the towne deſtroyed, hath gleaned out your houſe, as one eare out of a ſhocke of corne, and preſerued it alone amids the multitude of ſo monſterous flames, though I am in no caſe to exhort you whome I prefer before my ſelfe, or at the leaſt do make no inferiour, eyther in the due acceptation of ſuche a benefit at his Highnes hande, or in recounting the cauſes why he hath ben more mercyfull to you then the reſt of all that towne, and what purpoſes he ſeemeth to haue pointed and aymed at therein: yet ſith I dayely heare men more reddye to attribute occaſion vnto the meanes whiche the Lord vſed in that action of mercy, and to detract from him that honour and priuiledge that in all good thinges is due to him onely: then to waye and conſyder what it is to neglect the meryte of his grace herein: I am to craue your pardon if this my Epiſtle ſhall ſeeme any thing tedious and not facioned with that DECORVM that beſt might become ſo ſhort a diſcourſe as is the treatis it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>You knowe I am ſure that albeit the caſe of the towne in that diſmall daye wherein it was afflicted, was no leſſe myraculous in the eyes of good men, then feareful to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad whoſe tonges at the ſame inſtant could implore the ayde of God and attende vpon his ordinance, yet hath it pleaſed ſome ſince that time to make ſo diuers conſtructions thereof as dothe agree and ioyne with all vntrueth: and to take ſo ſlender taſt of true knowledge as if their ſences had eyther of late forſaken them, or as if they were newe drunke and lulled a ſleepe in their obliuion, as in truthe they ſeeme in all goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe be the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that turn al things be they neuer ſo graue &amp; waightie vnto wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes, that are alwaies muſling with beaſts in the myre of worldly matters, &amp; neuer vouchſafe to lend ſo muche as half an eye to looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſunſhine of Saluation, ne will be procured to put forth one poore nuger to take acquaintance of the power and prouidence of God: but readily proffer their hand &amp; the ſeruice of al the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tal parts of their bodye to welcome &amp; enterteine Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon that monſter their Maiſter.</p>
            <p>But it is no matter, thei ſhew eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame modeſtie towards God whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſheweth himſelf vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> courſe of their life thei haue don towards thoſe that are preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, namely the profeſſers of the Goſpel, &amp; in the ende, ſhal find their fault I doubt not, &amp; throughly vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it either vnto perpetual pain, or repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance: In the meane ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſith in their darkenes we perceiue faire daylight &amp; the glory of God

            <p>Let vs I ſay, be ſure, that God reuealeth himſelf to no infidel, preordeined to perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; therefore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme our ſelues ſo much the more in our hope, by how much the leſſe they make reconing of the trueth &amp; their own headines &amp; wretched co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For in truth, nothing can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the good eſtate of a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his own ſoule &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with more vndoubted argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſeeth himſelf co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the wicked actions &amp; demeanour of worldlings, &amp; hath fayth in all the changes &amp; chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of this vnconſtant lyfe to pul true obedience vppon him for his protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: The reſt rowle euery waye &amp; tumble vp &amp; downe like reſtleſſe waues of water, allwayes relatinge the mercies and myracles of the Lord as accidents to prophane beginninges.</p>
            <p>And as they are ſeldome poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of humilitie, euen ſo they toſle and turmoyle them ſelues in affliction til they are windleſſe, and then breathe and to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, with infinit curſſinges and quarreles till tract of time hath worne awaye the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe of their caſe, or made them feele the pricke that poſteth their danger, of ſickneſſe death, or deſperation.</p>
