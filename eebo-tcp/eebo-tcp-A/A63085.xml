            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Trecherous Plot of Confederacie in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Rebels have done much harme in the Country of <hi>Calway,</hi> in the province of <hi>Conog</hi> where they ſpare no cruelty to any Sex, eſtate or degree whatſoever, and that even upon the Lords day: on which day if they are not ſhedding of bloud, they have meetings of playes, gaming, paſtimes, bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes, drinking, and abominable venery, and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in every place where they come.</p>
            <p>Vpon St. <hi>Andrewes</hi> day laſt, being the 30 of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1641. there pitched about the number of 300 Rebels in armes neare <hi>Logreags,</hi> and <hi>Artaure,</hi> who marched with Spaniſh Cullors, and Armes in their Antient, and 100 more pitched neare <hi>Temenage,</hi> who hovered up and downe about the woods and villages therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, ſeeking an opportunity to worke their wicked deſignes.</p>
            <p>Their intent was (as it was conceived) to march to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ort Omnie</hi> to ſurprize the Earle of <hi>Clanrickards</hi> houſe, and to take away, and overthrow his forces; which conſiſt of an hundred horſe, and as many foot, which is the beſt ſtrength thereabouts: but it ſeems that their intent was as well to ſurprize the Caſtle of <hi>Logrags,</hi> and the Fort of <hi>Callway</hi> alſo, as well as the forces of the ſaid Earle, but they were preverted at that time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97346:3"/>The ſaid Caſtle of <hi>Logerage,</hi> and the Fort of <hi>Calway</hi> were in great danger to have beene betrayed into the hands of the Rebels, by ſome popiſh ſouldiers, with certaine popiſhly affected Gentlemen and Marchants that were inhabitants there.</p>
            <p>They conſpired a plot with the <hi>Rebels,</hi> in which plot they intended a bloudy deſign in cruell manner, againſt the Caſtle, Fort, and townes thereabout, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in had they accompliſhed their deſignes, they would, as it is juſtly feared, bin as cruell to the Proteſtants there, as they are in other places thereabouts.</p>
            <p>To contrive this Plot covertly and ſuttlely not to be taken notice of, they had contrived a way to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then themſelves with Ammunition from <hi>France,</hi> for there were there enhabiting certain Marchants, whoſe ſhips were come from thence laden with ſalt: The comming of which ſhips, as it doth appeare, were an <hi>Item</hi> to the <hi>Rebels,</hi> to give them notice of the time, which cauſed them then to march into thoſe parts, as it is conceived. Theſe ſhips being laden with ſalt, were preſently gone about to be unladed, to which Office, were picked out by the Marchants, ſuch who they thought fitteſt for that ſecrecie: yet were there diſcerned by the Officers, to bee brought from the ſhips, muskets and ſwords: which being diſcovered to the Proteſtans there, the matter was further ſought into, and it was found, that there were brought over from <hi>France,</hi> buryed in the ſalt, beſide the ſaid muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and ſwords, divers other Ammunition for war; brought over, as is conceived, for to ſtrengthen the <hi>Rebels</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> or at leaſt the Papiſts thereabout to aſſiſt them in the betraying up of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:97346:3"/>
places into their hands by the ſaid forces, by which meanes, both the Fort and Caſtle, and all places thereabouts were in great danger.</p>
            <p>About this time, the ſhips being well nigh unla-which was about St. <hi>Andrews</hi> day, as before, the rebels marched about theſe places, where they began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and fall upon the people, putting many to the ſword, ſo the Proteſtants at <hi>Callway,</hi> &amp; therabouts, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on the Ammunition, and ſtrengthned themſelvs: whereby they fell upon the <hi>Rebels,</hi> and there was a great battell fought between them, which wrought a great feare to all people thereabouts: but there came in good ayd to the Proteſtant ſide; ſo that in that fight they received not much hurt, onely ſomewoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But of the Iriſh rebels there were taken twenty, which were ſent to the States to be cenſured, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hundred ſlaine, and wounded ſo ſore, that they are not likely to live, and the reſt returned backe againe, and fled for their lives to another part of the running Campe.</p>
            <p>The next day they returned againe with a greater Force, but marched two or three miles from <hi>Logrags</hi> on the other ſide toward the Earle of <hi>Clanrickards</hi> againe, againſt whom they have long conſpired, and they marched ſo furiouſly in the night, that they were come to the ſaid Earle of <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickards</hi> before they were taken notice of, or their returne known: ſo that in the morning ere they were aware, the houfe was beſet with the Rebels, who began to pull downe the walls, and diſcharged againſt the houſe, which they could not come neare, becauſe the wall is ſo large about the houſe, ſo the forces of the Earle prepared themſelves, &amp; came forth againſt them; but the Rebels being too ſtrong for them, ſlew about 30 of their company in a ſhort ſpace, and diſcomfitted the Lord and his company exceedingly, ſo that they were all in great feare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97346:4"/>But it pleaſed God to ſend them up reliefe from the town, &amp; ſome other <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that came in from other places thereabouts to relieve them, whereby the Rebels were ſo beſet on a ſudden, that they were faine to flye, and take the woods.</p>
